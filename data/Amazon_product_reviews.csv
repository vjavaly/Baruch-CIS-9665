AV1T09fyvKc47QAVgf2R,Amazon,,Amazon Fire TV Game Controller,0.0,"This is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more",Great controller with 2 major problems! Not recommended at this point in time...
AVzRkFTFvKc47QAVd43-,Amazon,,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,0.0,"In this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways, its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this. It covers the Fire fine. The fit is snug and snaps into place no problem. A hidden magnet auto-wakes/sleeps the display when you open/close it. The fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants. Yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of propping up fire when you want to use it hands free. You can get it to stay, but it often slides out, or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle. Whether it's in portrait or landscape orientation, the stand on the back is so wonky, that you're better off just using a jar of peanut butter and a couple pieces of chewing gum to get it to stay in place.",Just Bad
AV1T19jOglJLPUi8H8Y9,Amazon,,Certified Refurbished Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - Black,1.0,"Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size.Read more",Honest Kindle Review

AVpfo9ukilAPnD_xfhuj,Amazon,,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,0.0,"Voice remote gave out nearly a year after I purchased. changed batteries several times and nothing. Have to rely on Phone App for it to function. Paid 19 for the stick when it was being promoted to Prime members. Now they want 30 , for an extra 10 might as well buy another Fire Stick, what a rip off for a hollow piece of plastic. Even with the Voice Remote feature, I still don't think it is worth it. Amazon should sell the remote for 10-15 dollars for Prime Members, we shouldn't have to worry if it fails outside of the warranty period. Amazon is already charging an arm and a leg for Prime Membership and its content to begin with.","OEM Remote gave out after 12 months, considering replacement"

AVzRkFTFvKc47QAVd43-,Amazon,,All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Case (7th Generation,1.0,"This is an improvement over the Origami case we purchased for my husband's old 2013 Fire 7. He liked the case but the way it would collapse into several sections when trying to close was frustrating for me. This one has only 2 sections, so the folding issue is very minimal and it stands up well in both landscape and portrait as long as the tablet is in the correct orientation. (Just give the tablet a 180 if you can't get it to stand.) I don't usually like blue, but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly. There is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive. The cutouts are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover. I often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases, but I had no trouble removing this one when I needed to. The only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times. Overall, a very nice, classic case.",Very complimentary to the new Fire HD 8
AV1T09XZ-jtxr-f31CoT,Amazon,,Amazon Tap Sling Cover - Blue,1.0,"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap
AVzRloqLGV-KLJ3aavBd,Amazon,,All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation,0.0,"This works as a case, and matches the color of the kindle nicely. The main feature I wanted was the stand, however. It is only one corner flap, as pictured. I incorrectly assumed there might be slightly more technology involved. There is no stop or anything to keep it from going completely flat backward. Starting out, my kindle would sit at a nice 70 degree or so angle from the table, but now my kindle will sit at maybe 30 degrees off the table. Eventually it will just go flat.

AV1T19k3GV-KLJ3adSMS,Amazon,,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,0.0,"DON'T BUY a reburbished Kindle. I've had to return them, twice. Apparently, Amazon's definition of refurbish is to take a Kindle with some problem or defect, simply repackage it and send out again to see if some different customer might take it off their hands.Both times, the 'refurbished' Kindles shorted out in different ways.

AVsRilrqnnc1JgDc34jd,Amazon,,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,0.0,"As good as the Echo is, the Echo Voice Remote seems to leave much to be desired. Whereas the Echo Dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently, the Voice Remote is far less likely to do so. Sometimes I'm not even heard at all. I often have to repeat commands several times before the Echo responds to me. Plus the volume control on the remote is slow to respond. And I don't mean a millisecond slow. The volume won't change for several seconds after the button is pushed.Yes, this is the New Generation Voice Remote.Aha! You say. You must be too far away from the Echo Dot.Granted, I am on the other side of the house when I use the Voice Remote. However, that doesn't explain why the shuffle button works immediately and correctly--every time. Plus doesn't Amazon brag on the device's great range If it was a distance problem, wouldn't the shuffle button have the same connectivity issue No, either I have a bad remote or the Voice Remote doesn't work as effectively and effortlessly as the Echo Dot itself. That's too bad.*** UPDATE ***I discovered that there is a trick to being understood when you use the Voice Remote, but it also comes with a gotcha. When you press down and hold the Talk Button on the Voice Remote, it's the equivalent of using the wake word on the Echo itself (Alexa, for example.) Since you can't see the LEDs on the Echo respond to the wake word, the Echo makes a tone to let you know that it's listening. There is a second a different acknowledgement tone after you release the Talk button. The Echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question.Read more","Has Trouble Understanding Commands, Volume Control Slow to Respond"

Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",I would say these are the 'go-to' headphones for everyday use 343 people found this helpful.

AVpjWh8e1cnluZ0-Vy0O,Amazon,,Fire HD 6 Tablet,1.0,"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones.

There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more","Kindle vs. Nook (updated) 31,885 people found this helpful.

It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.",Excellent Sound in a Small Package

I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function.

AVpg4dIu1cnluZ0-7fWM,Amazon,,Kindle Paperwhite 3G,1.0,"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more","No big improvement in the 2015 model 10,"

Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more",Great controller with 2 major problems! Not recommended at this point in time...
AVpge-anilAPnD_xtDVf,Amazon,AMDSI,Amazon Premium Headphones,1.0,"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them... 380 people found this helpful.

I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen/lost (not sure which). My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust.

AV3atCk2glJLPUi8SQna,Amazon,,Amazon Echo Dot Case (fits Echo Dot 2nd Generation only) - Merlot Leather,1.0,"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).",Great upgrade for aesthetics

AV1T0_ti-jtxr-f31CoV,Amazon,,Amazon Tap Sling Cover - Magenta,1.0,"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap

My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.)

Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers.

AVsRipBGv8e3D1O-lxRe,Amazon,,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,1.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right. In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon. We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon. The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands. To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without. Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try. Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!Update: After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.1. Use the best speakers you can with it. I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.2.

So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane.

Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page.

My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust. Settings/Device Options/Screen Light. I'm not actually sure that the night light is working. It was at 18 when I turned off the light (this is quite bright), and I checked it about 10 minutes later, and it was at 17.Read more","I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this ... 5,"

With every new model, I was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends. The Voyager was the first time I felt somewhat frustrated with an Amazon product.Yes, it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models - if you are buying your first one, don't hesitate - it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an iPad - even if it is an iPad Mini.But... There are a few things that I thing Amazon should fix on this one, specially because it is the top of the line Kindle:1. The battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself. The magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader. Previous covers just stayed in place and even the Apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one.2. As you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side, you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen. The way I got used to handle the kindle and as I constantly change hands when I am reading, I get a lot of undesired page turns because I touched the screen somewhere. A very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device.3. Battery life (even with the cover) is far from what I expected. My old Kindle had a battery that lasted for more than a month, the new one needs recharging every 15 days.4. The device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple,e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag.5.Read more",Easy to read and very light but was frustrated with a few things...

It works well, no complaints, but it marks up easily and the sides began flaking off. My original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back. I was much more careful with the merlot, and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time. And the flaky thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap. And for 90, I would expect real leather. So I switched back to my original black cover and I'm just letting it age with the device. I guess the plus side is that the merlot made me like the black cover more, but the downside is it cost 90 to do so. Ridiculous.As stated in the title, I love my Oasis. I've had it for about six months and, with the exception of the defective first one I received which was promptly replaced, I haven't had a problem out of it. I had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice, always. However, a couple of months ago I had gotten a screen protector and skin for the Oasis, and I just wasn't feeling the black cover anymore. I had considered the merlot (I think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch, but I despise brown leather) so I gave in after much consideration and ordered it. It didn't arrive with the bundle of things that it was supposedly shipped with, but after a quick call to customer service I had a new tracking number. It finally arrived today. I am disappointed to say that I don't love it. It smells funny, as I done remember my original doing. The color is duller than in the picture.

Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9 HDX, but Im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case.

They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",I would say these are the 'go-to' headphones for everyday use 359 people found this helpful.

The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers.

AVphEeRyilAPnD_x035P,Amazon,,Fire Kids Edition Tablet,0.0,"As the Kids Edition is nothing more than a basic 50 7 Kindle Fire with some extras, this review is primarily concerned with the 50-worth of extras bundled with the Kids Edition. Primarily, the year of included Freetime.As for the guts of the tablet itself, it's fine. Not great, but certainly fine. It's not the fastest tablet. It isn't the most feature-rich tablet. It doesn't have the sharpest display. But it's only 50, so it deserves to be graded on a curve. For a 50 tablet, it's great.Now, grab a coffee, get comfortable, because I have some thoughts on Amazon's Freetime service for kids/parents:Price plus the year of Freetime were the selling points for me (the case and added warranty were nice bonuses). The problem is, Freetime, though fantastic in theory, isn't even half-baked. It's a lump of dough left on the counter to rise. And then whoever was supposed to put it in the oven got distracted and forgot about it. It's getting moldy, and it smells kind of funny.Freetime: great in theory, terrible in practice.Normally, when you buy a new tablet, it might have a little bloatware pre-installed, but you generally don't start with the offerings of the entire app store on your homescreen. You find and add the apps you want.The way you install/remove apps in Freetime is sort of backwards. It's subtractive. Every single title is served up on the home screen (and in the apps, books, videos screens). These aren't technically pre-installed, but to a young kid looking at a sea of icons, it looks like he has all of these wonderful titles at his disposal. Well, he does. But only sort of.

Without exception, I have always received EXCELLENT customer service. Until now. I'm having difficulty with my Fire TV connecting to my wifi. Last Saturday I spent approximately 1- hours (maybe 2) troubleshooting with two women techs on the phone. Mary (who I was passed to from the first tech because of her expertise) said she thought it wasn't just a problem unique to me and asked me if she could call me back on Sunday after researching the problem. I had no problem with that. No call on Sunday so I called on Monday. Much to my surprise, there was no record of my call attached to my file. The rep was confused as to whether I was talking about fire wire or Fire TV so I was first sent to a different department. Finally, I got through that fire wire was not the same as Fire TV and I was transferred back to digital. We went through the same troubleshooting taking up a lot of my time. I was willing to do it until we were going around in circles and my phone was running out of juice. The gentleman asked me if he could research and call me later in the day. NO CALL. It's Tuesday--still no call.It really pains me to have to say anything negative about Amazon's Customer Service as it has NEVER BEEN LESS THAN EXCELLENT IN THE PAST. I've noticed I haven't gotten a survey as I usually do after a customer service call. Whoever Amazon has farmed out their digital customer service to will ruin their excellent customer service reputation and they will lose sales because of it. I'm going to wager a bet that there is no record of the 3-4 hours of my time on the phone trying to solve a problem and no record of two promises to call me back. I would have had more respect for these reps if I had received a call saying they were sorry, but they weren't able to come up with a solution for me.I'm hoping Amazon has kept a record of my past reviews and will review my account and see just how much I've spent over the years as a loyal customer. I'm very disappointed that I had to write this review, and I'm hoping someone who can change things reads this and saves Amazon's reputation. I can't be the only one receiving this kind of treatment. It's obvious that the people who are techs for Fire TV are not the same techs that I've dealt with in the past. In fact, I don't think they are even in the same country.

I just plugged it in, updated the software, and away I wentCons:- First and foremost, there is STILL no way to search for only free movies on Prime.- Amazon touts it's 40,000 Prime movies available, but good luck finding them. There is no categorization by genre. You are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any Prime movies- Voice search works only on Amazon content. You cannot use this to search within Netflix, for example- The Amazon FireTV box only comes with 8GB of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. There are games available for download that consume almost 2GB for ONE GAME. Good luck downloading a 1.76GB game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games.Clearly, Amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. In the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day Prime membership for free to try it out. However, Amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. It's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free Prime content only. This is my biggest beef with Amazon, by far. I want a Netflix-like experience, where my Prime content is sorted by genre, and I can search for free movies only. Now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. If you want it to access your Prime content only, stick to the Roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good.UPDATE:I called customer service, and talked to a guy about how I can search for and access my 40,000 Prime movies. Well....YOU CAN'T According to him, I can only find the Prime movies on the two lists on FireTV that say Recently added to Prime and Top Prime Movies. Those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. THERE IS NO WAY TO SEARCH OR BROWSE FREE PRIME CONTENT ONLY. The guy I talked to said this was a very common request for people.

I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones.

This second one is just as like new as my first one. The packaging is similarly like new. It has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit, and I believe the power adapter, cable, and manuals are all actually brand new.",My refurb is like new. I love the Echo Dots!
AVpfODXeilAPnD_xXeUd,Amazon,,Replacement Remote for Amazon Fire TV Stick,0.0,"These remotes are terrible and basically disposable. I'm now on my third remote and have yet to own one that has lasted longer than five months. My family is not rough on them, either. But as the touch pad gets the slightest bit dirty from daily handling, the remote starts getting glitchy and then stops working. And gently cleaning them doesn't seem to help. Terrible design from Amazon.",Disposable.

AVsRipBGv8e3D1O-lxRe,Amazon,,Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,1.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen. We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi-room voice recognition technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a multi-device plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices.Read more","A huge improvement over last years release and for half the price 5,"

AVpe7LD5LJeJML43ybWA,Amazon,,"Kindle Fire HDX 7""",1.0,"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more","Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition 6,"

Very easy to keep clean. This new design for the fire HD 8 is FABRIC. How long do you imagine a yellow fabric cover is going to stay clean I cannot see any easy way to clean it, like I do with the vinyl covers. I bought one for myself as well as my Mother. I will keep them but I sure hope they don't turn around and produce vinyl ones after all the concerns I am sure will be coming. I won't be able to afford two more.",Cover material is very disappointing.

It falls off completely and if you do get it in place within five minutes it's slipping again and huge bubbles form. I have never had a problem with a Moshi product before and I am very surprised by this. At this price there is no excuse for the poor longevity of this product and I would never ever buy one again nor would I advise anybody to spend the money on this product to begin with.Original review follows in all its irony except for the whining about the price at the time that I still stand by:Superb screen protector. The best you can buy. Ridiculous price. Moshi products have been the stress reliever I've relied on when it comes to tablets and phone screen saver installation with their bubble proof installation and performance, but in this particular case I think the price I paid was twice what it was worth. So now the stress is back.",Updated Downgrade

AVpfo9ukilAPnD_xfhuj,Amazon,,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick,0.0,"I have had to change the batteries in this remote once or twice per month since I purchased it in March. After the battery's short life span after the first battery replacement, we stopped doing any gaming with it and just used the gaming controller. It did not make a difference. It still drained the batteries just as quickly. I do have the option of using the phone app, and I do, but what if I'm not home and someone else wants to use the fire tv This is very, very poor quality product. Of course. It went out of warranty 12 days ago. I guess I should have been more mindful of that date. I do not recommend this product and I think Amazon should extend the warranty coverage. It is ridiculous that this remote basically doesn't work.",Battery draining remote!!!!

AVpjWh8e1cnluZ0-Vy0O,Amazon,,Fire HD 6 Tablet,1.0,"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function.
