cited,Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 170,"Relevant principles in the context of claimed breach of s 52 , as explained by the Full Court in SAP Australia [1999] FCA 1821 ; 169 ALR 1 at 14, include the following: &#8226; Initial confusion is sufficient and it is not necessary for confusion to induce or be likely to induce a transaction. Conduct which misleads a customer so that, under some mistaken impression of a trader's connection or affiliation, he or she opens negotiations or invites approaches may be misleading or deceptive even if the true position emerges before the transaction is concluded. &#8226; However, each case depends on its own facts and conduct may not be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, notwithstanding that it may engender temporary and commercially irrelevant error (cf Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 170 at [56] ; Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181 at [41] ). &#8226; Characterisation of conduct as ""misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive"" involves a judgment of a notional cause and effect relationship between the conduct and putative consumer's state of mind. 71 In addition to these principles, it is also clear that: &#8226; In order to determine whether there has been any contravention of s 52 it is necessary to determine whether or not the conduct complained of amounted to a representation which has or would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct has been directed: Astrazeneca Pty Ltd v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 22 at [34] . &#8226; Whether or not there is the requirement of some exclusive reputation as an element in the common law tort of passing off, there is no such requirement in relation to Pt V of the TPA. The question is not whether an applicant has shown a sufficient reputation in a particular get-up or name. The question is whether the use of the particular get-up or name by an alleged wrongdoer in relation to his product is likely to mislead or deceive persons familiar with the claimant's product to believe that the two products are associated, having regard to the state of knowledge of consumers in Australia of the claimant's product: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Limited (2007) 159 FCR 359 at 419; Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181 at [39] . &#8226; Where the relevant conduct involves representations to the public at large or to a section thereof, such as prospective purchasers of a product the respondent markets or proposes to market, the issue is one of identifying the ""ordinary"" or ""reasonable"" members of that class of prospective purchasers: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; [2000] 202 CLR 45 at 84-85. &#8226; It is necessary to isolate by some criterion a representative member of the class of prospective purchasers: Campomar [2000] HCA 12 ; 202 CLR 45 at 85.

applied,Powell v Evreniades (1989) 21 FCR 252,"The term 'serious hardship' is not defined in the Act. In Powell v Evreniades (1989) 21 FCR 252 (' Evreniades ') Hill J considered the term as used in s 265 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). His Honour, who was concerned with serious hardship to a taxpayer's dependants upon the death of the taxpayer, observed, at 258: 'There is no definition in s 265 of what is meant by 'serious hardship' nor would one expect there to be. Each of the words in the phrase is an ordinary English word having a well understood meaning. The context in which the words appear makes it clear that the Relief Board is to consider whether the exaction of the full amount of tax would involve the dependants of a deceased taxpayer in financial difficulty which in all the circumstances can be said to be serious. The financial difficulty will be such that the dependants will be in significant need warranting action by the Relief Board to relieve their condition.' 14 Hill J accepted that there was a distinction between extreme and serious hardship noting that what will constitute either will depend on the circumstances. His Honour also said it was inappropriate to attempt to state tests of what would constitute 'serious hardship' in the abstract and commented, at 259: 'Clearly there would be severe financial hardship if the dependants of a deceased person were left destitute without any means of support. That is not to say that in any particular case something less than that will not constitute serious hardship.' These observations were referred to with apparent approval by Gummow J in Van Grieken v Veilands (1991) 21 ATR 1639 at 1644. 16 In the Amended Notice of Appeal the applicant complains that the Tribunal used the 'wrong test' in determining the prospect of 'serious hardship' for the respondent. In its written submissions it expressed its complaint somewhat differently saying that the Tribunal 'misunderstood the meaning' of the term. It seems to me that the latter expression is less likely to lead to confusion as it recognises, at least implicitly, that ""serious hardship"" is itself the test that has to be applied to an applicant's circumstances to decide if that applicant is eligible for relief from a tax debt. There is no other test, although there may be issues about which factors, in the particular circumstances, are or are not relevant to this determination. It is because the assessment is based so squarely on the individual circumstances that Hill J in Evreniades thought it was inappropriate to try and identify, in the abstract, the circumstances that would give rise to serious hardship. 17 This is not to say that guidance cannot be given by examples in which the test of serious hardship would clearly be met. In Evreniades, Hill J gave such an example when he recognised that there would be 'severe financial hardship' if persons were left 'destitute without any means of support'. The Taxation Ruling gives a similar example when it says that there would be serious hardship if a taxpayer were left 'without the means to achieve reasonable acquisitions of food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements'. I do not see any inconsistency in these examples. Effect must be given to the qualification of 'reasonable' in the Taxation Ruling and, consistently with the reasoning of Hill J, these examples do not exclude the possibility that something less than destitution will constitute serious hardship. Whether this is so depends on the particular circumstances of each case. 18 It is not entirely clear that the Tribunal appreciated that the Taxation Ruling allowed for consideration of individual circumstances. In commenting on the Ruling the Tribunal said that 'it is no more than policy and cannot bind this Tribunal'. This comment seems to suggest that the Tribunal misunderstood the Ruling as providing a rigid rule. As I have already explained, I do not think that this is the correct interpretation of the Ruling but, as the Tribunal did not apply any such rigid rule, the misunderstanding is not of present concern. 19 The applicant submitted that the Tribunal's rejection of the Taxation Ruling indicates that it used some other unidentified test of serious hardship to make its decision. I do not accept this submission. The Tribunal noted that what is needed for proper maintenance and support is a relative question that can only be answered with regard to the whole of the taxpayer's circumstances. The Tribunal considered all the relevant aspects of the respondent's circumstances including whether he could achieve 'acquisitions of food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements' that were not excessive or unreasonable in all the circumstances. I do not accept that the Tribunal used the wrong test. 59 The Tribunal was aware that it had discretion to grant or withhold relief even it was satisfied on the serious hardship point. This is made clear by the Tribunal's quoting from the decision of Hill J in Evreniades, where his Honour said at 262-263: 'It follows from Trebilco that in the course of consideration of the release of tax under s 265 the Board may consider not only such matters as go to the issue of serious hardship but also other matters which in the discretion of the Board may be relevant, those other matters being merely proscribed by the general principle that the discretion must be exercised bona fide and for the purposes for which it was conferred, there being jurisdiction in this Court to intervene if in the overall exercise of the discretion the Board does take into account considerations which having regard to the purposes served by s 265 , can be seen to be irrelevant,' 60 I am satisfied that the Tribunal did exercise its discretion. Although the issue of discretion is not addressed under a separate heading there is sufficient indication of this throughout the Tribunal's reasons for me to be satisfied that this is so. 61 It was accepted on all sides that the respondent's debt had not arisen because of avoidance or participation in any scheme. The applicant submitted, however, that the Tribunal failed to take into account that the respondent had earned substantial amounts of money in the relevant period without making adequate provision for his tax liability. The transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal shows that the Tribunal questioned the respondent about the issue. The respondent talked at length about the difficulties he had in the law firm where the income that gave rise to the tax debt was generated. He said that the firm had the capacity to reduce his income retrospectively so that amounts that he was anticipating he would receive did not materialise. He also referred to difficulties he had experienced on a family level in moving from interstate at a time when his wife's illness, with consequent medical expenses, first manifested itself. At the same time one child's learning difficulty and another's serious heart condition (now resolved) were diagnosed. The combination of these factors led to his neglecting his financial affairs and not realising that a debt was accumulated. His subsequent drop in income made it impossible to meet the debt."
cited,Wigan v English and Scottish Law Life Assurance Association (1909) 1 Ch 291,"to sue for an antecedent debt pursuant to an agreement, either express or implied, may constitute valuable consideration, including in a bankruptcy context: Wigan v English and Scottish Law Life Assurance Association (1909) 1 Ch 291 at 303, re Zampatti ex parte RJ Levack Ltd [1993] FCA 170 , Cannane &amp; Anor v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1996) 65 FCR 453 at 466, Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Racovitis [1995] FCA 959 , Victorian Producers Co-Operative Co Ltd v Kenneth [1999] FCA 1488 , Phillips Fox (A Firm) v Westgold Resources NL [2000] WASCA 85 at [22] . However in bankruptcy-related proceedings the forbearance must be for value. This point was emphasised in para 84.14 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 (Cth), which enacted s 120 in its current form, states: Forbearance to sue has always been regarded at law as good consideration. Such forbearance will, under the Act as proposed to be amended by the Bill, have to be looked at in the light of the likely value of the chose in action. (emphasis added)"

applied,Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404,"Commonwealth v Northern Land Council [1993] HCA 24 ; (1993) 176 CLR 604 , a public interest immunity case about documents recording cabinet deliberations, the Court said at 620: There was, therefore, no call for Jenkinson J to order that the documents be produced for inspection. But we would add that, even if there had been, the procedure of ordering production of documents for inspection by the legal representatives of one of the parties, even upon a restricted basis, before the claim for immunity had been decided by the court, was open to serious question. Whatever the safeguards, it represents an encroachment upon the confidentiality claimed for the documents. And in this case, public interest in their immunity from disclosure was of the highest order. If inspection of documents is necessary to determine the question of immunity (and in this case it was not) then it ought to be carried out by the court before ordering production for inspection by a party. No doubt this may in some cases cast a heavy burden on the court, but it is unavoidable if confidentiality is to be maintained until a claim for immunity is determined. See also Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 469 and Gypsy Jokers Inc v Commissioner of Police (WA) [2008] HCA 4 ; (2008) 234 CLR 532 at [180] and [185] per Crennan J. Northern Land Council and Alister concerned inspection by the court of the documents over which privilege was claimed. In Gypsy Jokers Crennan J spoke more broadly of ""information in documents"", ""certain material relied on for determination of a proceeding"" and ""confidential material before a court"", which was not revealed to a party seeking it. In The Queen v Bebic (unreported, 27 May 1982) the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales dealt specifically with the disclosure of the contents of an affidavit tendered in support of a public interest immunity claim. There Samuels JA, Nagle CJ at CL and Cantor J said at 4: Mr Mason tendered an affidavit in support of his claim for privilege. He submitted, however, that the affidavit should not be placed on the file, that is to say that it should be read only by the Court and not disclosed to the party calling, on the footing that the contents of the affidavit would or might themselves compromise the claims for privilege. We had and still have some doubts about the propriety of restricting the affidavit in the way proposed. However, it may well be that that course is, in certain cases, of which this is one, no more than a logical extension of the established practice of the Courts inspecting the allegedly privileged documents itself. Later at 5, after saying that the Court had read both documents in question and the affidavit in support of the claim for privilege, their Honours said: It seems to us that granted that it is now commonplace for judges to make a private inspection of documents in order to resolve a claim for privilege ..., it follows that in a proper case the judge may similarly keep to himself the affidavit by which the claim is supported. The Court then ordered that the affidavit remain sealed up with the papers on the ground that to disclose its contents might prejudice the claim for privilege. I have referred in connection with the respondent's affidavit to the great importance that is attached to the respondent's opinion as to the damage to national security incident upon disclosure. Obviously that is also the case in relation to the disclosure of the documents over which privilege is claimed. I have summarised the respondent's reasons for his opinion about the possible effects of disclosure of the documents in question. This is all derived from the open parts of his affidavit. The Final Appreciations and related briefing notes set out the reasoning process that underlies the making of security assessments, which are the key mechanism by which ASIO advises government that particular individuals pose a threat to national security. If documents falling within this class were required to be produced, ASIO would be giving information about its knowledge, assessments and methodology to the very people to whom it is most important that national security information is not disclosed: cf Alister 154 CLR at 454-455 per Brennan J. As the respondent has deposed, the relevant class is ""one of the classes of documents held by ASIO that require the greatest level of protection"" first, because of the inherent sensitivity of the information that is routinely contained in such documents, and second, because of the detrimental consequences in terms of the quality of decision-making that would be likely to follow if ASIO officers were forced to omit particular kinds of information from Final Appreciations and related briefing notes due to the risk that those documents will become available to persons the subject of security assessments. The applicants contended that the respondent was not able to make a class claim. It was said that he seeks to describe as a class claim documents which he considers constitutes a Final Appreciation and documents related thereto. That description, they say, does not constitute an identifiable class. The table in the affidavit (set out at [9]) refers to an internal email, an internal minute and a briefing note. It does not refer to any Final Appreciation. By way of contrast, the applicants assert that Cabinet documents constitute a clear class claim. Here they say the so-called class claim involves the respondent asserting for himself that particular documents constitute Final Appreciations. I do not think that is a fair description of the respondent's claim. The presently relevant parts of his affidavit are as follows: (a) shortly after identifying the documents in the table at [9] he describes them on a class basis as ""paradigm examples of documents that ASIO should not be required to disclose save in exceptional circumstances""; (b) the results of complex security assessments are usually contained in a Final Appreciation document, though it may not be headed in that way; (c) the Final Appreciation ordinarily takes the form of an ASIO minute; (d) when the investigative branch assesses an individual to be a threat to Australia's national security, the respondent is advised, usually by a DGBN; (e) often both a DGBN and a Final Appreciation are provided to the respondent for decision; (f) it is the document on which a security assessment is based, being the Final Appreciation (however that document is headed) and any associated DGBN that cannot be disclosed; (g) the class claim advanced concerns the class of documents shortly described as ""Final Appreciation documents and related briefing notes""; (h) documents in this class invariably contain specific detail as to why persons are assessed as a risk to national security, and specific details of intelligence sources and methods; (i) the respondent has examined the ASIO documents, namely those in the table (the class claim) and the contents claim documents; and (j) the disclosure of the documents in (i) would prejudice Australia's national security for the reasons stated in the affidavit."
followed,Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 261,"Fundamental to the Tribunal's decision was its understanding that the relevant test of ""substantial compliance"" was as discussed in Baidakova v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1436 at 6. The Tribunal applied the ""substantial compliance"" test to Condition 8202(3)(b). However, the requirement in Condition 8202(3)(b) to provide a certificate cannot, logically, be satisfied by substantial compliance. Either Condition 8202(3)(b) is satisfied or it is not; either there is a certificate of an ""at least satisfactory"" academic result or there is not ( Jayasekara v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 167 ; (2006) 156 FCR 199 per Heerey and Sundberg JJ). It is not in dispute that the education provider, the University of Sydney ('the University') had not provided the necessary certificate. There was no compliance with Condition 8202(3)(b). There is ' no scope for operation of the distinction between strict compliance and substantial compliance ' in determining whether Item 8202(3)(b) of Sch 8 of the Regulations is satisfied ( Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 261 at [10] , cited in Jayasekara at [5])."
cited,Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684,"The Applicant contends that there is no power to revoke the s 16 notice: Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 498 , 162 ALR 625 ; Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 at [108] , [2007] FCA 1684 ; 98 ALD 589 (Varied: Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24)."
cited,NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10,"The appellant says a proper inference can not be drawn from the country information relied upon by the Tribunal that an applicant for a passport is of no interest to PRC authorities on grounds of prior protest conduct for reasons of political opinion, simply because the applicant obtains a passport and achieves an objective of lawfully leaving China. However, five things should be noted. First, the Tribunal was entitled to prefer the country information it obtained and rely upon it in discharging its fact-finding role ( NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 [11] and [41], relying upon VTAG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 91 ; (2005) 141 FCR 291 and VAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 161 at [25] ). Secondly, the finding is primarily supported by the Tribunal's assessment of the appellant's evidence. Thirdly, the appellant accepted that he had not engaged in protest activity and explained the conjunction of circumstances causing that to be so. Fourthly, even if no proper inference arises out of the older country information, the Tribunal did not act on 'no evidence' in reaching its finding as evidence (that is, the appellant's own evidence) supported the finding. Fifthly, the question of whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law just as whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law. Accordingly, in the context of judicial review, the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. On the other hand, clearly enough, there is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact. In addition, even if the reasoning upon which the decision-maker reached its conclusion of fact is demonstrated to be unsound, that would not amount to error of law ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2002) 65 ALD 141 per Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ at [34]). Even if it is accepted that the earlier country information did not support an inference drawn by the Tribunal, there was nevertheless evidence before the Tribunal supporting the findings of fact."
cited,Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229,"Court's discretion to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is unfettered, except that it must be exercised judicially. The usual order as to costs is that a successful party will have its costs paid on a party and party basis by the unsuccessful party: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234. As the passage from Cretazzo indicates, the mere fact that a substantially successful applicant fails on particular issues of fact or law along the way may not afford an adequate ground for depriving that applicant of some or all of its costs. On the other hand, it lies within the Court's discretion to make a costs order that reflects the degree of success attained: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234-235 [11] and 236 [15].

cited,Re Application by PPI Industries Pty Ltd (1989) 17 IPR 667,
referred to,Ansell Rubber Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd [1967] VR 37,"I do not think that Pioneer Concrete is of assistance on the present point. The issue there was an alleged breach of restraint of trade covenants and required the Court to consider the difference between acts preparatory to the carrying on of a business and carrying on a business. Independent Management is more helpful. The plaintiff in that case alleged that a former employee had misused confidential information obtained during her employment and had breached her duty of fidelity. The employee had successfully tendered for a contract previously held by the plaintiff. Marks J said that the skill and information gained by the defendant was outside the protected category. He referred to the following observations of Gowans J in Ansell Rubber Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd [1967] VR 37 (at 40): In this field a distinction has to be maintained between information and knowledge acquired in confidence by an employee during his employment which he uses or discloses for his own advantage while he is still an employee, and information and knowledge so acquired which he uses for his own advantage after his employment is finished. A further distinction has to be drawn between information which forms part of the employee's stock of general knowledge, skill and experience, and that which should fairly be regarded as a separate part of the employee's stock of knowledge (whether it be identifiable as ""particular"" or ""detailed"" or ""special"") which a man of ordinary intelligence and honesty would regard as the property of the former employer."
applied,Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225,"The High Court (Dawson, McHugh and Gummow JJ, with Brennan CJ and Kirby J dissenting) in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 ( Applicant A ) held that such fear would not constitute persecution for a Convention reason. 24 In Applicant A , the Tribunal had accepted as a matter of fact that coercive measures were used in the implementation of China's family planning policy, and that coercive measures ranged from forms of civil discrimination to fines and forced contraception, sterilisation and abortion: see at 251. The Tribunal defined the social group in question as "" those who having only one child do not accept the limitations placed on them or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised ."" 25 The majority in the High Court held that persons who oppose China's one child policy and feared sterilisation did not constitute a ""particular social group"", because the uniting feature was a fear of persecution. 26 Dawson J said in his reasons, at 243: In this case, the reason the appellants fear persecution is not that they belong to any group, since there is no evidence that being the parents of one child and not accepting the limitations imposed by government policy is a characteristic which, because it is shared with others, unites a collection of persons and sets them apart from society at large. It is not an accurate response to say that the government itself perceives such persons to be a group and persecutes individuals because they belong to it. Rather, the persecution is carried out in the enforcement of a policy which applies generally. The persecution feared by the appellants is a result of the fact that, by their actions, they have brought themselves within its terms. The only recognisable group to which they can sensibly be said to belong is the group comprising those who fear persecution pursuant to the one child policy. For the reasons I have given, that cannot be regarded as a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention. 27 McHugh J said, at 269-270: If, as is probably the case, the Tribunal meant by ""those who ... do not accept the limitations placed on them"" those couples who believe that they should be able to have more than one child notwithstanding the government's policy, there is nothing to link the couples so as to create a perception that they constitute a particular social group. There is simply a disparate collection of couples throughout China who want to have more than one child contrary to the one child policy. Some may wish to have a child as soon as possible; some in the near future; and others in the distant future. There is no social attribute or characteristic linking the couples, nothing external that would allow them to be perceived as a particular social group for Convention purposes. To classify such couples as ""a particular social group"" is to create an artificial construct that bears no resemblance to a social group as that term is ordinarily understood. 28 And Gummow J said, at 285: I would assume, for the purposes of the determination of this appeal, that the PRC has a ""one child policy"", infringement of which attracts, as a matter of governmental decision, the sanctions feared by the appellants. I assume therefore that there exists a policy which is being implemented in a fashion which engulfs a number of persons for whom the PRC is their country of nationality. On that footing, a disparate collection of parents, and those desiring to be parents, who do not accept and have difficulties in complying with a ""one child policy"" are at risk of the application of a general law of conduct required by the state and, on the assumptions I have made, brutally enforced. But they are not members of a particular social group with a fear of persecution by reason of membership thereof. 29 The only distinguishing feature between Applicant A and the present case is the form of persecution feared, namely, the appellant in the present case fears compulsory abortion as opposed to compulsory sterilisation. 30 Gummow J said, at 286, that "" ... the form the persecution takes should not 'be inserted into the definition of the social group .'"" 31 Consistent with the judgment of the High Court in Applicant A , the Tribunal, while accepting that ""the applicant has been badly persecuted in the past"", concluded that the appellant had not pointed to any harm which would amount to persecution which she fears she will suffer for one or more of the five Convention reasons if she returns to China. 32 Similarly, before the Federal Magistrates Court, Scarlett FM records, in [29] of his Honour's reasons: Counsel for the Minister, Ms Sirtes, submitted that the Applicant, whilst she had made quite clear that she did not wish to return to China, had not demonstrated any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal and submitted that the Applicant's unfortunate circumstances did not provide any ground for remitting her application to the Tribunal. 33 Scarlett FM held that Ground 2 of the appellant's appeal was "" ... really a challenge to the Tribunal's factual findings "", and therefore no case of jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal had been made out. 34 This is not a challenge to a factual finding by the Tribunal. The Tribunal held, however, that mistreatment amounting to persecution for breach of the ""one child"" policy was not persecution because of membership of ""a particular social group"", and therefore the appellant did not fall within the definition of a refugee. 35 The legal position is plain. The appeal to this Court from the Federal Magistrates Court has to be dismissed with costs."
cited,Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464,"For an issue estoppel to arise, (1) the same question of fact or law must necessarily have been decided; (2) by a judicial decision that was final; and (3) the parties to the earlier judicial decision or their privies must be the same persons as the parties in which the estoppel is raised; see Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34 ("" Kuligowski "") at [21]; Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 ("" Blair v Curran "") at 531 532. 47 It is also true that this finding necessarily established the legal foundation or justification for the conclusion which his Honour reached; it was legally indispensable to the conclusion; see Blair v Curran at 531 532."
referred to,Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197,"support can be gained from the well-known ""ticket cases"" in the law of contract. Those cases establish that where an exemption clause is contained in a ticket, and the other party is not actually aware of the terms of the clause when the contract was made, the party seeking to rely on it cannot do so unless, at the time when the contract was made, reasonable notice was given to the other party: see Seddon and Ellinghaus, Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract (9 th Australian Edition, 2008) at [10.28] and [10.70]; Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 228-229. This principle has no application here, because as the authors of Cheshire and Fifoot observe at [10.71], it is necessary to determine with some precision at what point the contract was made. That cannot be done in the present case. What the composers and EMI would need to establish is that Ms Sinclair submitted her entry after the publication of the circular or after the July edition of Matilda and that each of those publications constituted reasonable notice. Having regard to Ms Sinclair's close connection with the Victorian Girl Guides, it is mere conjecture to say that this is what happened. It is equally probable that she heard of the competition by word of mouth and submitted her entry before the publication of those documents. Accordingly, it has not been established on the evidence that Ms Sinclair entered into a contract in writing on the terms contained in the circular, or, at least, that the contract included the term which provided for all ""matter"" to be the property of the Victorian Girl Guides. It follows that there was no assignment in writing to satisfy the requirements of s 5(2) of the British Copyright Act ."
cited,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609,"In relation to these grounds of appeal, the submissions of the appellant can be summarised as follows: &#8226; the information relied on by the Tribunal was that the appellant could have gone to India immediately upon receiving her passport in 2003 without obtaining a visa. This appeared in response to the appellant's statement in a statutory declaration that she did not have a visa to depart Nepal. The information upon which the Tribunal relied, namely that she could leave Nepal without a visa, was not merely the conclusion or thought processes of the Tribunal &#8226; it is clear from the decision of the Tribunal that this information undermined the appellant's claim that Australia owed her protection obligations, and accordingly it was within s 424A as considered by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 as it was not information which fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(a) &#8226; information the Tribunal had with respect to Nepalese citizens entering India was limited to information the Tribunal had concerning whether it is possible to fly directly from Australia to India with a Nepalese passport. The relevant information upon which the Tribunal relied did not deal with circumstances in which a Nepalese person could enter India from Nepal. 26 In response, the respondent submitted in summary: &#8226; the statements of the Tribunal with respect to the ability of the appellant to leave Nepal with her passport was not ""information"" within the meaning of s 424A(1) , but rather the subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations of the Tribunal: VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 476, SZBYR 235 ALR at 616 &#8226; if these statements, including with respect to the ability of the appellant to go to India, were ""information"", it was information within s 424A(3)(a) &#8226; even if the statements were ""information"" within the meaning of s 424A(1) the Tribunal did not act in breach of the section in that it brought to the appellant's attention the fact that she could have left Nepal when she received her passport. Did the Tribunal rely on ""information"" within the meaning of section 424A(1)? 29 The factual basis of ""information"" was reiterated by the majority of the High Court in SZBYR 235 ALR at 616 where their Honours said in relation to ""information"" in s 424A(1): ""However broadly 'information' be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence."" 30 It is not in dispute that ""information"" for the purposes of s 424A(1) does not include ""subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations"" of the Tribunal: SZBYR 235 ALR 609. ""Subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations"" include for example: &#8226; the Tribunal's disbelief of an applicant's evidence arising from inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence ( SZBYR 235 ALR at 616, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162 , VAF 206 ALR at 476, WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276) &#8226; a determination by the Tribunal that the applicant's account is or may not be credible ( Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 , Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 428) &#8226; a determination of the Tribunal that the information provided by the applicant in the original application lacks specificity and detail: VAAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 120 &#8226; a view taken by the Tribunal as to the unsatisfactory nature of answers provided by an applicant: NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328."

referred to,VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471,"The RRT's knowledge that the standard letter contained an assurance of privacy can be regarded as 'information' for the purposes of s 424A. The Court in SZEEU treated the discussion of the word 'information' in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 ("" VAF "") as a point of departure for its own consideration of the appeals before it. In VAF , Finn and Stone JJ said, at [24]: "" [T] here is now a considerable body of case law concerned with the compass of the term 'information' in its s 424A(1) setting.

cited,Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283,"The discretion of the Court conferred by the words 'or within such further time as the court concerned allows' appearing in s 46PO(2) HREOC Act is similar to the discretion given to the Court in s 11(1) Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (' ADJR Act '). Principles applicable to the exercise of the discretion under s 46PO(2) were described by McInnis FM in Phillips v Australian Girls Choir [2001] FMCA 109 , based in turn on principles formulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348 in relation to s11 ADJR Act . These considerations articulated in Phillips have been applied in a number of Federal Court decisions including Pham , Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Limited [2005] FCA 1541 (Jacobsen J) and Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 624 (Cowdroy J), and are relevant in the case before me. The principles listed by McInnis FM are as follows: 1. There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so. The 'prescribed period' of 28 days is not to be ignored ( Ralkon v Aboriginal Development Commission (1982) 43 ALR 535 at 550). 2. It is a prima facie rule that the proceedings commenced outside the prescribed period will not be entertained ( Lucic v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411 at 416). It is not a precondition for success in an application for extension of time that an acceptable explanation for delay must be given. It is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given as a relevant matter to be considered, even though there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential precondition ( Comcare v A'Hearn (1993) 45 FCR 441 and Dix v Client Compensation Tribunal (1993) 1 VR 297 at 302). 3. Action taken by the applicant other than by making an application to the court is relevant in assessing the adequacy of the explanation for the delay. It is relevant to consider whether the applicant has rested on his rights and whether the respondent was entitled to regard the claim as being finalised (see Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283 at 287). 4. Any prejudice to the respondent, including any prejudice in defending the proceeding occasioned by the delay, is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension (see Doyle at 287). 5. The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension (see Lucic at 416). 6. The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted (see Lucic at 417). 7. Considerations of fairness as between the applicant and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of exercise of the court's discretion (see Wedesweiller v Cole (1983) 47 ALR 528)."

One of its products was a koala soft toy, which had a label attached to it with the words ""Aussie Born"" on one side, and the words ""Made in Australia"" on the other side, with smaller words ""With Some Imported Components"" beneath those words. The soft toys were designed in Australia, the components were manufactured in China, except for about 30% of the filling, and all the components were then imported into Australia, for assembly within Australia. The primary judge declared the labels were in breach of ss 52 and 53(eb) of the TP Act and made an order under s 80 of the TP Act. The Full Court dismissed an appeal from those orders and held that the labels were misleading and deceptive, although that the toys could fairly be described as having been designed and finished in Australia. Sackville J observed at 500: While it should not be assumed that purchasers are ""extraordinarily stupid"" ... neither should it be assumed that purchasers of products such as toy koalas will be scrupulous to analyse the nuances of the language the trader has chosen to use on labels attached to the merchandise ... The meaning conveyed by the labels will be assessed by construing the language employed, but will take account of such factors as the prominence given to particular slogans or phrases, the nature of the product itself and the expectations and likely understanding of consumers."

cited,"Rabin v Mendoza &amp; Co [1954] 1 All ER 247, [1954] 1 WLR 271","the present case, Allphones put in train a formal dispute resolution process which involved negotiations with its disaffected franchisees and, if necessary, a formal mediation. In order to make that process worthwhile, at the time when the process commenced (viz on 29 August 2008), Allphones promised that it would provide relevant financial information to those parties with whom it was in dispute in order to facilitate those negotiations and that mediation. It was quite prepared to obtain and to provide to its franchisees an investigating accountant's report in respect of all of the critical matters in dispute. This was contemplated in the Notice of Dispute itself which, of course, was created and served approximately five or six weeks before the undertakings were given to the Court on 9 October 2008. A fair appreciation of the relevant events is that the two BDO reports were always intended to be part of the dispute resolution process and that Allphones had probably always intended to use them in support of contentions which it would make in the various Statements of Position served by it as to the quantum of the levies, charges, fines, bonuses, rebates and other payments in dispute. At common law, documents produced for the purposes of such negotiations attracted without prejudice privilege (see Rabin v Mendoza &amp; Co [1954] 1 All ER 247, [1954] 1 WLR 271 ; and Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Limited [2001] FCA 185 at [14] [16])."
referred to,Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky [1992] 39 FCR 31,"The applicant relied upon the judgment of the Full Court in Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31 ('Demagogue') to support the proposition that 'loss or damage' did not have to be loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded. That may well be correct but Demagogue may be distinguished on the basis that it concerned misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Trade Practices Act '), in the form of non-disclosure by a vendor of unusual features relating to access to land located at Noosa Heads in the State of Queensland, which the purchasers, who sought relief under s 87(1) and/or (1A) of the Trade Practices Act , acquired by entering into a contract which they would never have entered into had they been aware of the true position with regard to access to the site. The trial judge had clearly found a causal link between the misleading and deceptive conduct and the purchasers' entry into the contract (see per Black CJ at 33 and per Gummow J at 42). 112 Each of Black CJ, Gummow J and Cooper J found that the expression 'loss or damage' where used in s 87 of the Trade Practices Act , and which corresponded in many respects with s 412(2) of the Act in the present case, could include being saddled with an agreement which had been induced by misleading or deceptive conduct. At 33 Black CJ said: '... I consider it to be clear that the loss or damage contemplated by s 87(1A) is not limited to loss or damage in the s 82 [monetary damages] sense but was intended to include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract unconscionably induced. ... In my view, the loss or damage for the purposes of both ss 87(1) and 87(1A) will include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract induced by misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52. Proof of loss or damage of the sort that would be an ""amount of ... loss or damage"" for the purpose of s 82 is not a prerequisite for the grant of relief under either subsection.' 113 Gummow J, in his leading judgment, said at 42-43: 'The phrase ""loss or damage"" appears in s 82 and in various subsections of s 87, particularly subss (1) and (1A). In my view, on this appeal nothing turns upon the circumstance that in a given case subs (1) may be attracted only by reason of the making of an application under s 82 to recover the amount of the loss or damage suffered by conduct in contravention in (sic) a provision of Pt IV or V. Section 82 is concerned with the recovery of ""the amount of the loss or damage"" suffered by conduct in contravention of the Act. Section 87(1) requires that the court consider that its order will compensate ""in whole or in part"" for the loss or damage or will prevent or reduce the loss or damage. Section 87(1A) requires that the orders concerned will compensate in whole or in part for the loss or damage suffered ""or likely to be suffered"", or will ""prevent or reduce the loss or damage suffered, or likely to be suffered ..."". Thus, whilst s 82 is concerned with the recovery of an amount representing the loss or damage, s 87 is concerned with compensation, whether in whole or in part, for loss or damage and with the reduction of loss or damage, and with the prevention of loss or damage which is likely to be suffered. In the phrase ""likely to be suffered"", the word ""likely"" speaks of a ""real chance or possibility"": Western Australia v Wardley Australia Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 245 at 261. One significant distinction between ss 82 and 87 is the quia timet operation of s 87. On the appeal to the High Court in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 527 [Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said] : ""The Act draws a clear distinction in Pt VI between loss or damage which may be recovered under s 82 and the likelihood of loss or damage which may be prevented, or, if not prevented, reduced by one of the remedies under s 87."" Deane J said (at 850) that the statute in s 87 expressly distinguishes between the actual suffering of loss or damage and the likelihood (or contingency) that loss or damage will be suffered in the future. This emphasises that the phrase ""the loss or damage"", at least in s 87, may be concerned with more than pecuniary recovery as understood in the law of damages in tort; tort law postulates the commission, already accomplished, of a wrong: Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society Ltd v Slack [1924] AC 851 at 859, 868-869. Further, unlike the position at general law with the administration of the equitable remedy of rescission of contracts, orders under s 87 may be made not only against parties to the contract but also against third parties, being persons involved (within the meaning of s 75B) in the contravention as a result of which the plaintiff entered into the contract: Lezam Pty Ltd v Seabridge Australia Pty Ltd ... at 304; Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio ... at 714. The respondents complain that they entered into a contract as the result of reliance upon conduct which contravened s 52. Why should they not be described as having suffered loss or damage, within the meaning of s 87, by that very reliance and entry into legal relations from which they otherwise would have abstained? If that contract be declared void ab initio as provided for in s 87(2)(a), will that not reduce this loss or damage?' 114 Cooper J also proceeded in Demagogue to expound upon the meaning of the phrase 'loss or damage'. At 44, Gummow J expressed his agreement with what Cooper J said in that regard. Cooper J's observations were recorded at 46-48 as follows: 'Section 87 provides both the source of the court's power to provide a remedy and the remedy itself. It is therefore important to distinguish clearly between the need to establish the factual circumstances necessary to enliven the power of the court to grant relief and the circumstances which are relevant to the nature of the relief which it is appropriate to grant. The circumstance in s 87(1) which empowers the court to grant relief is a finding that a party ""has suffered or is likely to suffer loss or damage by the conduct of another person"". That is a question of fact. The words ""loss or damage"" where they appear in s 87(1) are to be construed by the application of the ordinary canons of statutory construction. This requires giving the words their ordinary meaning in the context in which they appear. The ordinary meaning of loss is ""detriment or disadvantage resulting from deprivation or change of conditions"" ( Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed (Revised), 1990) at 1241). ""Damage"" is defined as ""1. Loss or detriment caused by hurt or injury affecting estate, condition or circumstances (Arch) 2. Injury, harm"". ( Shorter Oxford English Dictionary at 485). There are two matters within the context of s 87(1) which colour the meaning of the phrase in the section. The first is that the loss or damage has been or is likely to be caused by conduct in contravention of the Act. The second is that any order made is to compensate for the loss or damage. However, the compensation is not limited to the payment of a money sum or damages as an examination of s 87(2) discloses. Nor is there anything in s 87(2) which would limit the loss or damage suffered or likely to be suffered to pecuniary loss or damage. In particular, s 87(2)(a) (declaring a contract or collateral agreement to be void) and s 87(2)(ba) (refusing to enforce any or all provisions of a contract) take as their point of focus the denial of the benefit of a contract to a person whose proscribed conduct has caused loss or damage to the other party. Such an order has the consequential effect of releasing the innocent party from the obligations imposed by the contract. In the context of providing compensation it is the obligations imposed by such a contract which is the loss or damage which the order seeks to redress. In my opinion ""loss or damage"" in s 87(1) means no more than the disadvantage which is suffered by a person as the result of the act or default of another ( Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed), Vol 12, par 1102) in the circumstances provided for in the section. The phrase ""loss or damage"" in s 87(1) does not involve any concept of quantum or assessment of damages: see Barneys Blu-Crete Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union (1979) 43 FLR 463 at 473 where Northrop J expressed a similar view as to the use of the same phrase in s 45D(1)(a) of the Act. This is to be contrasted with the context of the phrase in s 82 where it is ""the amount of the loss or damage"" which is recoverable by action. For the purpose of s 82 it is the quantum or assessment of the loss or damage suffered in monetary terms which must be demonstrated. The rules as to the assessment of damages or the measure of damages in an action for deceit are relevant to the question of loss or damage under s 82. However those rules are not relevant to the meaning of the phrase in s 87(1). The distinction between ""loss or damage"" and ""the amount of the loss or damage"" is reflected in the terms of section 4K of the Act. The section provides: ""In this Act (a) a reference to loss or damage, other than a reference to the amount of any loss or damage, includes a reference to injury; and (b) a reference to the amount of any loss or damage includes a reference to damages in respect of an injury."" There are practical reasons why this should be so. The prima facie rule that the measure of damage in deceit is the difference between the value of the property and the price paid is inappropriate where the contract is not completed: Myers v Transpacific Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [1986] ATPR 47,421 at 47,424. Where the contract remains unrescinded the costs associated with the conveyance of the property are costs arising out of the contract and of performing the obligations imposed thereby. Until the contract is rescinded such costs and expenses do not take on the character of costs and expenses thrown away and as such recoverable loss and damage under the general law. The court is not restricted in granting a remedy under s 87 by the limitations under the general law of a party's right to rescind for breach of contract or misrepresentation ( Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (1988) 79 ALR 83 at 102, 109). Likewise the limitations under the general law as to the assessment of damages and the measure of damage ought not be imported into a definition of ""loss or damage"" in s 87 to limit the category of actionable loss or damage. To adopt a definition of ""loss or damage"" for the purpose of s 87(1) which includes the disadvantage of incurring contractual obligations that would not have been incurred but for the conduct complained of does not mean that the granting of a proper discretionary remedy necessarily leads to the setting aside of such a contract or to a refusal to enforce it according to its terms. That result will always depend upon the particular circumstances which exist when the occasion calls for an exercise of the powers under s 87 of the Act. ...' 115 The problem for the applicant and Ms Stringer in particular, in the present case, is that there is simply no evidence of any loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded, if otherwise appropriate and available, in her favour or in favour of any of Karellas' other employees. Nor is there any evidence that the approval, making and/or coming into operation of the 2007 Agreement resulted from the contravention by Karellas of s 341(1) of the Act. 116 Section 412(2) of the Act confines the Court's power to declare a workplace agreement void to those cases where the relevant loss or damage to be remedied, prevented or reduced is loss or damage 'resulting from' the relevant contravention. In order to establish a causal link between the contravention of s 341(1) of the Act and Karellas employees becoming saddled with the 2007 Agreement in this case, evidence would be required from employees of Karellas who voted to approve the agreement indicating that had it not been for one or other of the misrepresentations contained in the four page document or the three page document put around by Karellas, they would not have voted as they did. 117 In the absence of any evidence on the issue, the Court may not make an order declaring the 2007 Agreement void. It is unnecessary, in the circumstances, to address the proper exercise of the Court's discretion to grant relief under s 409(a) of the Act were it otherwise able to do so. 118 In the foregoing circumstances, there should be a declaration that the employee collective agreement styled 'Karellas Investments Pty Ltd Employee Collective Agreement 2007' was not approved in accordance with s 340(2) of the Act. Otherwise, the Amended Application filed in Court on 23 May 2007 should be dismissed. 119 Given the terms of s 824 of the Act, there should be no order as to costs.

cited,Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss &amp; Co (1994) 49 FCR 89,"the purposes of a passing off action, it should also be noted at the outset that the comparison involved is different to the comparison undertaken for the purposes of resolving whether the use of a mark is "" deceptively similar "" for the purposes of s 120 of the Trade Marks Act : Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss &amp; Co (1994) 49 FCR 89. Gummow J there observed at 128: Where the comparison of the marks is necessary to determine whether that of the defendant is deceptively similar to the registered mark of the plaintiff, who sues for infringement, the primary comparison must be between the registered mark on the one hand and the mark as used by the defendant on the other. The comparison differs from that in a passing off action where the plaintiff points to the goodwill built up around the mark by reason of prior use and then points to the conduct of the defendant as leading to deception (or perhaps merely confusion) and consequent damage to that goodwill of the plaintiff. No relief is sought as against the First or Second Respondents. Liability is, however, sought to be established as against the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents. That liability is said by the Applicants to arise by reason of either: s 75B of the Trade Practices Act , in the event that there is a contravention of ss 52 or 53 of that Act; or the liability ascribed to directors and others for corporate wrongdoing, in the case of an infringement of the trade mark or passing off.

cited,Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629,"The preference claim is qualified by the elucidator. However, there can be no doubt that Unilever intended to communicate superiority. This is not a case of ""mere puffery"" ( Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629 at [44]). That asserted superiority was in terms of performance attributes, rather than other attributes such as fragrance. While Mr Kibble may have intended the testing to be of ' the performance of the product and its sensory appeal (skin feel and fragrance)' (emphasis added), the advertisement made no reference to fragrance and little or no reference to sensory, in contrast to tanning performance, appeal. 40 It follows that I accept Johnson's submission that the message communicated by the commercial is that 7 out of 10 users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin for its tanning attributes. The first representation was made in the television advertisement. 41 The print advertisement states that Summer Glow ' combines rich body lotion with a hint of self tanning agents ' and includes in its list of the product's attributes ' everyday body moisturiser ' and ' gradually builds a beautiful light tan '. This places greater emphasis than does the television advertisement on the moisturising capacity of the product. 76 Comparative advertising does not create any presumption with respect to a breach of the Act ( Energizer at [20]). However, as Heerey J pointed out in Energizer , the more actual comparison is used, the more potential there is for error and half-truth (at [20]). The factual assertions must be ' not untrue, or misleading half-truths ' (at [22]). Lindgren J discussed at [34] the comparator to which the consumer would understand the advertisement to be making reference. In that case, it was conceded that, if the comparator to which the consumer would understand the advertisement was referring was all Energizer batteries rather than the one particular battery the subject of comparison, the advertisement was misleading or deceptive. 77 Unilever's reliance on the failure by Johnson to establish that a different preference would have been expressed had all four variants been tested by the study is ill-founded. The fact is that the study simply did not include the two variants of Holiday Skin or compare them to both variants of Summer Glow. The reasonable consumer would have understood, in the absence of qualification, that the user preference was found to exist across all variants, or at the least, to a comparison of each comparable variant, when no such preference had been expressed in the ""use test""."
cited,Commonwealth v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd [1980] HCA 44 ; (1980) 147 CLR 39,"to the question posed in [56(b)] above (the cause of action based upon the breach of the equitable duty of confidence), the following matters are relevant: (a) The classic definition of the equitable duty of confidence is found in Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch 469 at 475. At that part of his reasons, Swinfen Eady LJ said: The principle upon which the Court of Chancery has acted for many years has been to restrain the publication of confidential information improperly or surreptitiously obtained or of information imparted in confidence which ought not to be divulged. Injunctions have been granted to give effectual relief, that is not only to restrain the disclosure of confidential information, but to prevent copies being made of any record of that information, and, if copies have already been made, to restrain them from being further copied, and to restrain persons into whose possession that confidential information has come from themselves in turn divulging or propagating it. These observations were cited with evident approval by Mason J in Commonwealth v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd [1980] HCA 44 ; (1980) 147 CLR 39 at 50; (b) In the present case, the information was not improperly or surreptitiously obtained. It is contended that it was imparted in confidence in circumstances where it ought not to be divulged; (c) The question of whether an equitable duty arises in the present case is not straightforward. The relevant information was contained in documents which were produced pursuant to compulsory powers invoked by the ACCC and in circumstances where it is at least arguable that the only source of any duty of confidence is s 155AAA itself. Although the use of documents and information obtained compulsorily in this way is constrained by s 155AAA and perhaps may be constrained by other general law principles, it is difficult to see how a party in the position of Allphones could sensibly expect that the information would be kept confidential and not disclosed even for legitimate purposes associated with the due performance by the ACCC of its statutory functions. It may be thought that this is particularly so in circumstances where Allphones made no express claim for confidentiality when the documents were produced. In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 , [2008] ATPR 42-218 , Gordon J, in the context of considering claims that documents ought not to be disclosed on public interest immunity grounds, said (at [30]): The theoretical merit of the ACCC's confidentiality contentions is even more deficient. A cartel claim, by definition, involves collusion between two or more actors. In the same way that it is both inevitable and self-evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against (ie, disclosed to) the non-cooperating conspirators, it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows, or should know, that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties. As such, the ACCC's claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance. And without such a reasonable expectation, the ACCC's contention that non-disclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand. and (d) The definition of protected information seems to me to contemplate a dichotomy between information that is given (voluntarily) in confidence to the ACCC, on the one hand, and information that was obtained by the ACCC (compulsorily) pursuant to a s 155 Notice, on the other hand. In the latter case, the section seems to contemplate that there is no room for any equitable duty of confidence to arise."

However, it has long been established that the Court may award costs on a solicitor/client or indemnity basis where the particular circumstances of the case warrant the Court departing from the usual order of party/party costs: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225. In Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (supra), Sheppard J set out some of the circumstances which he considered had been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion to make an order for payment of costs not on the usual basis of party/party costs but on the basis of indemnity costs. Those circumstances included ""an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise""."

considered,Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services (Trailer Engineers) Ltd [1979] 1 WLR 305,"The Commissioner sought to derive support for his contention from Hygienic Lily Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 396. The question there was whether waxed paper cups used by McDonald's Restaurants were ""goods ... of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes"". Gummow J at 399 said: ""the setting in which the phrase 'goods of a kind' appears suggests it is directed not to the use for which the particular goods in question were designed or manufactured, nor to the purpose to which it is intended these particular goods shall be put, but rather to the nature, quality and adaptation of goods in the class or genus in question. Thus, goods are 'of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes' if they are to be recognised as members of a class or genus which commonly or regularly (albeit not necessarily exclusively or principally) is used for household purposes; cf Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services (Trailer Engineers) Ltd (1979) 1 WLR 305, at 312-313, 315, 316-317."" At 400 his Honour pointed out that other items in the Schedule there in question directed attention not to goods identified by the purposes for which goods of that kind are ordinarily used, but to the goods in question themselves or to the identity or character of a particular user. He concluded that the cups were of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes because they were ""members of a class or genus (paper cups) which commonly or regularly (albeit not necessarily exclusively or principally) was used for household purposes (viz the carrying of beverages and the consumption thereof)"". 19 In Air International Hill J, dissenting, quoted with approval the decision of the Court of Appeal in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services (Trailer Engineers) Ltd [1979] 1 WLR 305, to which Gummow J had referred in Hygienic Lily . The question in the English case was whether couplings and winches were to be classified for value added tax purposes as ""Goods of a kind suitable for use as parts of goods within item 1 or item 5"". Hill J said at [28]: ""Brown LJ held that the words 'goods of a kind' referred to some class or category or genus of goods which had characteristics in common. That holding is generally consistent with the Australian sales tax cases referred to in Clean Investments."" Hill J then quoted with approval this passage from Megaw LJ's judgment (at 316-317): ""It is not 'the goods' the particular articles, here the couplings and the winch which have to be suitable for use as parts. It is the kind of goods to which these particular articles belong, their genus, which has to be thus suitable. The addition of 'of a kind', would be meaningless if goods which are themselves suitable are necessarily also goods of a kind which is suitable. The question is, first, what is the relevant 'kind of goods' of which they are members; and, secondly, is that kind of goods generically, suitable for use as parts of the goods comprised in items 1 and 5 of Group 3."""

referred to,M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131,"Two other matters were raised by counsel for the respondent.

In my view, having looked at the reasons for judgment in that case, I am not persuaded that they vary the position in any way from the position taken in NAZY v MIMIA or in M55 v MIMIA . Accordingly, I do not consider that there is any basis for a contention that there has been a breach of s 424A."

I say 'ordinarily' because the circumstances of each case will vary and the exercise of the discretion under O 46, r 6 of the Rules will have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case. I agree ... that a convenient touchstone for determining the question of access by non-parties is whether the documents or other material have been admitted into evidence. In general, the application of this principle will serve the interests of open justice. In particular, access to the documentary evidence can be expected to be helpful to a person seeking to understand or explain the proceedings, or to evaluate the Court's determination of the issues arising in the proceedings ...'

Pursuant to O 46 r 6(1) of the Federal Court Rules , a non-party will generally be entitled to access the pleadings. Accordingly I do not consider the comments of Santow J in eisa Ltd v Brady and Ors [2000] NSWSC 929 at [20] are applicable to this Court in so far as they apply to pleadings. However, in respect of affidavit material which has not been read in Court, the comments of Santow J in respect of affidavits accord with the principle outlined by Sackville J in Macquarie Radio and Seven Network ."
discussed,Derby &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon (Nos. 3 and 4) [1990] 1 Ch 65,"The contention of the applicant in the present case that the Court could debar the respondents from defending the proceeding, and strike out their defences, is based on a comment of Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in Derby &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon (Nos. 3 and 4) [1990] 1 Ch 65 at 81. In that case, the English Court of Appeal was considering whether it was appropriate for a court to grant a Mareva -type injunction in respect of assets beyond the jurisdiction of the court. Relevant to that question was the question whether such an injunction could be enforced in any event. The Master of the Rolls said: 'in the context of the grant of the Mareva injunction, I think that a sufficient sanction exists in the fact that, in the event of disobedience, the court could bar the defendant's right to defend. This is not a consequence which it could contemplate lightly as it would become a fugitive from a final judgment given against it without its explanations having been heard and which might well be enforced against it by other courts.' Neill LJ at 87 and Butler-Sloss LJ at 96 expressed agreement with the judgment of the Master of the Rolls. Each went on to deal with the issues in the case, with Neill LJ at 95 expressing specific agreement with what the Master of the Rolls had said about enforceability. Butler-Sloss LJ did not comment specifically on that issue. It is unnecessary in the present case to debate the question whether barring the right to defend a proceeding falls within the range of penalties the Court could impose for contempt of court. Order 35A of the Federal Court Rules contains specific provisions about the powers of the Court in the event of default of a party in complying with an order. Order 35A r 2(2)(d) provides that a respondent is in default by failing to comply with an order of the Court in a proceeding. Order 35A r 3(2)(c) provides that, if a respondent is in default, the Court may: 'if the proceeding was commenced by an application supported by a statement of claim or the Court has ordered that the proceeding continue on pleadings -- give judgment against the respondent for the relief that: (i) the applicant appears entitled to on the statement of claim; and (ii) the Court is satisfied it has power to grant'. Order 35A r 3(2)(d) also provides that, if a respondent is in default, the Court may give judgment or make any other order against the respondent. Order 35A r 4 specifically provides that O 35A does not limit the power of the Court to punish for contempt. It must be the case, however, that, if the Court exercises its power to give judgment against a respondent, on the ground that the respondent has failed to comply with an order of the Court, and the giving of judgment has significant consequences for the respondent, those consequences could be taken into account as factors mitigating the exercise of the Court's powers to punish for contempt. 52 The contempt in this case is a serious one. It involved a significant sum of money, $73 987.57. As I have said, Ms Bell was well aware that an injunction had been granted, restricting her freedom of action in relation to the sale of the Mariners Place property, and her freedom of action to deal with the proceeds of sale if a sale were effected. She chose not to have regard to the terms of that order. She preferred to satisfy her obligations, or perceived obligations, and to spend the money for her own purposes, instead of complying with the injunction. In short, she preferred her own interests, and even her own whims, to her duty to comply with the injunction. The effect of the contempt on the administration of justice is also of major significance. If Ms Bell had complied with the injunction, the applicant would have been secure in the knowledge that he could bring the proceeding to its conclusion and, if he were to be successful, there would be a substantial asset available to satisfy the judgment and to augment the estate of the bankrupt, for the benefit of the bankrupt's creditors. There is now a powerful disincentive to the applicant in proceeding to a conclusion, because the execution of any judgment is much less likely to prove fruitful. This consequence can be ameliorated to some extent by exercising the power to give judgment summarily against Ms Bell, thereby saving the applicant from the need to expend further costs in the proceeding, but it still renders the proceeding largely fruitless for the applicant if, as appears to be the case, Ms Bell has no means of satisfying a judgment. The effect of the contempt, therefore, is to tilt the balance in the litigation heavily against the applicant. 53 There can be little doubt that a contempt of this magnitude, coupled with the degree of culpability of Ms Bell (amounting to wilful blindness as to the terms of the order, as I have said, and to preferring to satisfy her own needs and desires) would warrant a significant term of imprisonment. Only if there are powerful mitigating factors would it be appropriate to consider a course other than imprisonment as a minimum step. It is therefore necessary to turn to the mitigating factors. 54 Ms Bell claims that she did not understand the nature of the order and therefore that she did not intend to commit a breach of it or to demonstrate any disrespect for the Court. She has expressed her contrition for her failure to comply, and has apologised to the Court. I accept that she did not in fact understand the terms of the order, although they had been explained to her by her then counsel, and she was in possession of a copy of the order. Although I do not consider that the order is a particularly complex one, I can accept that legal terminology and drafting techniques can make an order less than wholly comprehensible to some people. 55 The fact is, however, as I have found, that Ms Bell did not pay any heed to the order at all. She did not take the trouble to read it in the context of the conduct of the auction of the Mariners Place property, or in the context of her disposal of the proceeds of sale. She did not provide the agent responsible for the sale, or the auctioneer, with the copy of the order that she had, either for the purpose of guiding their conduct, or for the purpose of seeking guidance from them as to her own. She did not seek advice from Kelly &amp; Chapman, who were then acting for her in the principal proceeding. She simply decided not to have regard to the order. Even when her contravention of it was pointed out to her, she took no immediate steps to remedy the contravention. Her initial explanation, in her affidavit of 21 September 2006, was anything but frank as to what had happened to the proceeds. It was necessary for me to make a further order on 25 September 2006, requiring Ms Bell to make an affidavit, explaining specifically the manner in which the sum of $73 987.57 had been expended. Even then, in her affidavit of 9 October 2006, she was vague about a number of the payments she had made. Both of these affidavits were prepared by her without legal assistance, which is a partial explanation for their inadequacy. Even when she swore her affidavit of 18 December 2006, prepared with the assistance of her pro bono lawyers, no further detail was provided.

That is not to say that the principle articulated in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 has not been extended beyond the banker/customer/surety relationship, however circumstances in which the Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 principle is applicable are primarily confined to those involving the issue of a certificate as to the existence of a fact pursuant to legislation, or certain types of agreement, for example:"

I found that Mr Siminton was a person who had carried on and was proposing to carry on the business of banking in Australia and that such conduct constituted or would constitute a contravention of s 7 of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) (""the Act ""). I also found that Mr Siminton had engaged in conduct which contravened s 66 of the Act . I foreshadowed making injunctive orders to restrain Mr Siminton from engaging in further contraventions of the Act and orders appointing a receiver to identify the persons who had made deposits in the ""bank"" established by Mr Siminton, to get in the funds which were the subject of an order, made by Gray J on 10 January 2006, and to provide for an orderly and equitable distribution of those funds to depositors.

cited,Challenger Life Limited [2004] FCA 618,"Court has said that the granting of a dispensation under s 17C(5) (or its analogue in the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth), s 191(5)) is a ""matter of considerable importance and should not be regarded as a matter of course"": Munich Reinsurance Company of Australasia Limited [2004] FCA 1391 at [4] , per Tamberlin J. See also Challenger Life Limited [2004] FCA 618 ( Challenger Life Limited ) at [2]-[3], per Gyles J. This is because, as Sackville J stated in The Application of Commonwealth Life Ltd &amp; Anor [2003] FCA 501 ( Commonwealth Life Ltd ) at [8]: Clearly enough, the policy underlying the statutory requirement ... is to give every affected policyholder a summary of the scheme and, an opportunity, if he or she so desires, to make submissions to the Court in respect of any application for confirmation of the scheme. A right to be heard in relation to a proposed scheme may be of little value if a person does not know of the proposal. The fact that additional steps will be taken to draw the scheme to the attention of the affected policyholders (see [33]-[36] above) has been held to be a factor favouring the granting of a dispensation under s 17C(5) (or the equivalent provision of the Life Insurance Act 1995 ) in several cases, including GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd at [18], Commonwealth Life Ltd at [6] and [10], Challenger Life Limited at [5], and Calliden Group Limited at [62]. Fifth, APRA does not oppose the making of the order. The fact that APRA, which is charged with the responsibility of protecting the interests of policyholders, has raised no objection has been said to be a matter in favour of a dispensation: see, eg Commonwealth Life Ltd at [6] and [10], Challenger Life Limited at [5]; Calliden Group Limited at [62]."
cited,Registrar of Aboriginal Corporation v Murnkurni Women's Aboriginal Corporation (1995) 58 FCR 125,"J's decision was considered by Nicholson J in Registrar of Aboriginal Corporation v Murnkurni Women's Aboriginal Corporation (1995) 58 FCR 125 at 127-128. His Honour's reasons do not shed much light on the reason behind the respondent's failure to appear in that case, though it is apparent that the applicant had obtained an order for substituted service which was, as was accepted by the respondent in that case, properly effected. His Honour went on to say: It may not be that the dicta of Hodgson J in Kizkot and the principles relied upon for Murnkurni are necessarily in conflict. All that Hodgson J required was evidence which ""indicates"" solvency. He did not say that solvency was to be established as a fact. Certainly he must have accepted there should be evidence which indicates solvency in the sense of showing it to be arguable that the company was solvent. In my opinion the effect of the authorities is to require this Court to consider whether there is an arguable defence which in turn requires the Court to consider whether solvency is arguable. ... For the reasons given I consider that both the solvency and other aspects are arguable and that, accordingly, the application to set aside the order pursuant to FCR O 35, r 7(2)(a) should be granted."
cited,Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1,"In contrast, in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act (including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s 31) provide a scheme which allows ""a person aggrieved"" by alleged unlawful discrimination - including, as I have already noted, conduct deemed unlawful by s 32 DD Act - to lodge a complaint with HREOC (s 46P HREOC Act); and in the event that the complaint is terminated, a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court (s 46PO HREOC Act). Significantly, the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination, including payment of damages by the respondent, employment or re-employment an applicant, an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case (s 46PO(4) HREOC Act). Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct, and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct, personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct. To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East, ex parte Nguyen 196 CLR at 365, repeated in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 at 96, The elaborate and special scheme...was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention ... might obtain a remedy, and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia's treaty obligations, bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the [legislation] was to operate. (That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments, and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes, does not in any way minimise their relevance. As observed, in my view correctly, by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 1209 at [26] - [29] and [51]-[52], they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists.)"

cited,Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth [1943] HCA 19 ; (1943) 67 CLR 335,"Tenth, to the extent that incorporated associations are bodies corporate which may sue or be sued in their own name, in assessing the interests of a body corporate the interests of its members are arguably irrelevant. So in Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth [1943] HCA 19 ; (1943) 67 CLR 335 at 343 Starke J, without needing to decide the point, observed that an infringement of the rights of members of an incorporated body does of itself mean that the rights of the incorporated body are infringed, or that the incorporated body has standing to maintain an action (cf Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 253 and Nicholson J in Defence Coalition against RCD Inc v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1997) 74 FCR 142). This may be distinguished from the position concerning unincorporated associations. A useful illustration of this point in this context is Scully 79 FCR 537, where an unincorporated association commenced proceedings under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (in its then form), Wilcox J said: I agree with Commissioner Nettlefold that, as Executive Council for Australian Jewry is not a ""person"" in the eyes of the law, it is incapable of being a 'person aggrieved' within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act . Therefore it is not itself a competent complainant. However, this does not mean its complaint is a nullity. It is necessary to go behind the name and consider whether the juristic persons who constitute the unincorporated association are 'persons aggrieved' by the allegedly unlawful act. If they are, the complaint is competent in law, though not in name, as it was made by them. (at 548) 59 Second, there is substantial body of authority, to which I have already referred, that the interests of members of a body corporate do not equate with the interests of the body corporate: Victorian Chamber of Manufactures [1943] HCA 19 ; 67 CLR 335, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142."
followed,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381-382 [69] - [71] McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said: '[69] The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute (see Taylor v Public Service Board (NSW) [1976] HCA 36 ; (1976) 137 CLR 208 at 213 per Barwick CJ). The meaning of the provision must be determined ""by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole"" ( Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 320, per Mason and Wilson JJ. See also South West Water Authority v Rumble's [1985] AC 609 at 617, per Lord Scarman, ""in the context of the legislation read as a whole"".). In Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos ((1955) 92 CLR 39), Dixon CJ pointed out that ""the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed"". Thus, the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed ( Toronto Suburban Railway Co v Toronto Corporation [1915] AC 590 at 597; Minister for Lands (NSW) v Jeremias [1917] HCA 41 ; (1917) 23 CLR 322 at 332; K &amp; S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon &amp; Gotch Ltd [1985] HCA 48 ; (1985) 157 CLR 309 at 312, per Gibbs CJ; at 315, per Mason J; at 321, per Deane J). [70] A legislative instrument must be construed on the prima facie basis that its provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals ( Ross v The Queen [1979] HCA 29 ; (1979) 141 CLR 432 at 440, per Gibbs J). Where conflict appears to arise from the language of particular provisions, the conflict must be alleviated, so far as possible, by adjusting the meaning of the competing provisions to achieve that result which will best give effect to the purpose and language of those provisions while maintaining the unity of all the statutory provisions (see Australian Alliance Assurance Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Q) [1916] St R Qd 135 at 161, per Cooper CJ; Minister for Resources v Dover Fisheries Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 565 at 574, per Gummow J). Reconciling conflicting provisions will often require the court ""to determine which is the leading provision and which the subordinate provision, and which must give way to the other"" ( Institute of Patent Agents v Lockwood [1894] AC 347 at 360, per Lord Herschell LC). Only by determining the hierarchy of the provisions will it be possible in many cases to give each provision the meaning which best gives effect to its purpose and language while maintaining the unity of the statutory scheme. [71] Furthermore, a court construing a statutory provision must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision ( The Commonwealth v Baume [1905] HCA 11 ; (1905) 2 CLR 405 at 414, per Griffith CJ; at 419, per O'Connor J; Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigraiton Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 12-13,, per Mason CJ). In The Commonwealth v Baume ((1905) [1905] HCA 11 ; 2 CLR 405 at 414) Griffith CJ cited R v Berchet ((1688) 1 Show KB 106 [89 ER 480]) to support the proposition that it was ""a known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that such a sense is to be made upon the whole as that no clause, sentence, or word shall prove superfluous, void, or insignificant, if by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent"".' 46 Their Honours held (194 CLR at 384 [78]) that the duty of the court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning which the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. 47 In ascertaining what meaning the differing expressions in ss 290(2)(c) and 312(1)(e) were taken by the Parliament to have, it is important to bear in mind that each section is concerned with the impact which a conviction may have upon the Authority's performance of its functions in relation to the registration of a migration agent. First, s 290(2)(c) appears in the principal provision dealing with the function of registration, which is an annual event for every migration agent. Secondly, s 312(1)(e) is relevant to the ongoing function of the Authority under s 303 pursuant to which it has a discretion to cancel or suspend the registration of a migration agent or to caution him or her. The occasion for the exercise of that discretion arises if the Authority is satisfied, inter alia, that: '303 ... (f) the agent is not a person of integrity or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance;' 48 The evident purpose of s 312 is to cast an obligation on the migration agent to notify the Authority of the events there enumerated so that the Authority can consider whether to revisit, pursuant to s 303 and the scheme of natural justice in Part 3 of Division 3 of the Act, the question of registration. Thus under s 312(1)(a) the migration agent's bankruptcy must be notified and s 303(e) makes bankruptcy a matter which enlivens the Authority's powers to cancel or suspend the migration agent's registration or to caution him or her. And, s 290(2)(g) requires the Authority to take into account an applicant's bankruptcy at any time in considering whether to register him or her as a migration agent. 49 Additionally, s 312(1) deals with events which occur after registration but which, had they occurred beforehand, would have been relevant for the Authority's consideration in deciding whether to register the person as a migration agent. However, it is important in construing these provisions to consider the fact that a contravention of s 312(1) is an offence of strict liability (s 312(2)), while s 290 creates no offence. 59 Gleeson CJ and Gummow J (200 CLR at 397 [25]) held that the term 'law of the Commonwealth' in s 80 of the Constitution refers to laws made under legislative powers of the Commonwealth. They held that an obligation or liability which had its source in the Constitution itself did not arise under a law of the Commonwealth. They continued (200 CLR at 397 [25]): 'The fact that there are laws made by the Parliament which are declaratory of the power implicit in Ch III of the Constitution or which make provision under s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution incidental to the exercise of that power does not bring the case within s 80. ' Hayne J agreed with Gleeson CJ and Gummow J (200 CLR at 428 [108], 429 [113])."

It is clear enough that s 31A is wider than the previous regime for summary judgment had become. Counsel cited a number of decisions that have discussed this provision the latest being Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] per Jacobson J and Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574 at [13] per Tamberlin J.

Hence the significance of Sir Owen Dixon's observation as to the manner of construing the provisions now found in reg 87 of the Defence (Personnel) Regulations . This observation of Sir Owen Dixon has subsequently been cited with approval both in the High Court ( Marks v The Commonwealth [1964] HCA 45 ; (1964) 111 CLR 549 , at 573 per Windeyer J; Coutts v The Commonwealth [1985] HCA 40 ; (1984-1985) 157 CLR 91 , at 98 per Wilson J, Brennan J agreeing).and in this Court ( Bowthorpe v Minister for Defence (1986) 17 IR 192, at 195 per Neaves J; Bromet v Oddie ((2002) 78 ALD 320, at 331 per Finn J)."

While the reasoning process may advert to, and express views on, such issues, all will not necessarily constitute part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision. Tribunals, no less than courts, engage in their own species of dicta often enough for reasons related to haste and pressure in composition. When a Tribunal's reasons are to be evaluated for s 424A(1) purposes, the Court as a matter of judgment is required to isolate what were the integral parts of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision. That task, necessarily, is an interpretative one. In some instances the differentiation of the integral and the inessential may be by no means easy -- and made the more so by less than explicit indications in the reasons themselves as to what the Tribunal itself considered to be integral.' 24 Allsop J pointed out in SZEEU 230 ALR at [214] that the decision of the High Court in SAAP [2005] HCA 24 ; 215 ALR 162 requires some aspects of the analysis in VAF 206 ALR 471 to be rejected. However, I do not understand the authority of the above passage from VAF to have been generally undermined. Nonetheless, their Honours' reference to the 'integral' and the 'inessential' must be understood more strictly than may originally have been intended. The critical question is whether the information in question was a part (that is, any part) of the reason for affirming the decision ( SZEEU 230 ALR per Allsop J at [215])."
referred to,Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2007] FCA 1608,"The first objection was that s 65A of the Act was ""unconstitutional"" and that this precluded the laying of contempt charges.

followed,Repatriation Commission v Richardson [2001] FCA 1626,"First, the term "" matter "" can include new evidence relevant to the manner in which the prior decision was made. Section 31(6)(a) has not been construed, and should not be construed, as precluding an exercise of the power of review where new evidence or other material becomes available which has not previously been considered. And it may not matter that that new material was available even at the time when the Tribunal made its decision. Thus, Sundberg J went on to conclude in Davis as follows: It was also submitted for Mrs Davis that because Professor Cade's report had been received in time for it to be used by the Commission in support of an application for review of the Board's decision by the AAT, it could not found an exercise of the Commission's power to review the Board's decision under s31(6)(a). A variation of this argument was that the Commission, having had a reasonable opportunity to put Professor Cade's report before the AAT, had not done so, and so was not able to use the report to found an exercise of power under s31(6). These assertions were not developed in argument, and in my view they have no substance. If material becomes available after the relevant decision is made, and it affects the payment of a pension, the power in s31(6)(a) is available to the Commission. It is simply irrelevant that it becomes available at a time when the Commission might seek a review by the AAT. The Commission may engage in conduct which disables it from taking a particular course, but in the absence of any such conduct, it can pursue whichever avenue it chooses. The second argument advanced has overtones of estoppel without any factual basis to support the estoppel. Further, in Repatriation Commission v Richardson [2001] FCA 1626 at [15] [18], [2001] FCA 1626 ; 115 FCR 220 Dowsett J concluded that it was open to the Commission pursuant to s 31(6) to have regard to material of which it was ignorant at the time the original decision was made to grant a pension."
referred to,Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230,"There was no disagreement about the expression of the principles of construction. The debate lay in the different application of them, in particular in the subtle question of the correct perspective from, or prism through, which to read the patent application. The construction of the claims takes place in the context of the specification as a whole, recognising the existence and role of the different parts thereof, the Court having placed itself in the position of someone acquainted with the state of the art: Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230 at 236 [39]; Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 at 610; and Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd v Arico Trading International Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at 16 [24] . That said, two different people skilled in the art may take the meaning of the specification as a whole or the claims therein differently. That may reflect the perennial problem of the imprecision of language, meaning and perception or it may reflect different emphases taken from the prior art. In such cases (as to a degree is the case here) the following words of Hely J in Flexible Steel Lacing Company v Beltreco Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331 at 350 [81] are apposite (in his Honour's always helpful, if I may respectfully say so, discussion of the principles of construction of patents at 347-350 [70]-[81]): ""As a general rule, the terms of a specification should be accorded their ordinary English meaning. Evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words which might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning. However, the construction of the specification is for the Court, not for the expert witness. Insofar as a view expressed by an expert depends upon a reading of the patent, it cannot carry the day unless the Court reads the patent in the same way.""

cited,Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187,"applicants submitted that the view that s 251G did not prescribe a topic which permitted the production of information was supported by three authorities: Smorgon v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1976] HCA 53 ; (1976) 134 CLR 475 ; Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187 ; O'Reilly v Commissioners of State Bank of Victoria (1983) 153 CLR 1. The notice was addressed to Armstrong Scalisi Holdings Pty Ltd. The applicants contended that a notice could not be addressed to a corporation but only to its proper officer. In truth, there were two submissions here; one, a submission that a notice could not be served upon a corporation; the other, that if it was, it had to be addressed to the corporation's proper officer. These arguments are, so it seems to me, quite without substance. It has been accepted that a corporation cannot be required physically to attend and give evidence for the very good reason that it is an abstraction lacking physical form: Smorgon v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group [1976] HCA 53 ; (1976) 134 CLR 475 at 481-482 per Stephen J. However, that physical constraint has no impact on the ability of a corporation to answer questions. It is for that reason well established that a corporation may be required to provide information. Indeed, Lockhart J described the contrary argument as ""fallacious"" in Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187 at 198, an observation with which I respectfully agree. Burchett and Hill JJ also rejected the argument (at 203 and 218 respectively). The power in reg 168(2) to require production of books and documents is a power to produce books and documents in the custody of the person receiving the notice. It does not extend to require a party to bring documents into existence: Fieldhouse at 194-195 per Lockhart J, 204 per Burchett J and 209 per Hill J. It follows that the notice could not lawfully require the production by CAP of copies of original documents held by it. Of course, it is possible that the notice did not on its proper construction seek the creation of documents but instead the production of any copy documents which were in fact held. Lockhart J canvassed this possibility in Fieldhouse at 194-195. In this case, I do not think that the natural and ordinary meaning of subparagraphs (a), (c), (d) and (g) is that they require production of copies already in existence. It follows that these paragraphs are not supported by reg 168(2). Even if that were not so, however, the subparagraphs are ambiguous in that they leave the recipient unsure whether production of copies already existing is called for or whether copies of originals are to be made. The notice is, therefore, also bad for uncertainty: cf. Commissioner of Taxation v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1979) 143 CLR 499 at 525 per Gibbs CJ; Fieldhouse at 193 per Lockhart J, 204 per Burchett J and 210 per Hill J. FAILURE TO SPECIFY MATTER It has been held that a notice under s 264 which is bad in part may be severed. So much was held by Burchett J in Fieldhouse at 204 and by Hill J at 210. Lockhart J clearly assumed such a power to exist. However, on the facts in Fieldhouse , both Lockhart and Burchett JJ thought that severance was not practical because the provision of the copies was central to the notice so that parts of it no longer made sense if the paragraphs dealing with copies were excised. Hill J, on the other hand, did not share this concern. I do not think that the notice in this case suffers from that problem. Paragraphs (a), (c), (d) and (g) can be severed from the notice without the balance of it losing coherence. It should be noted in passing that the form of reg 168(2) may well present difficulties of application in the case of electronically held records, but it is not, presently, necessary to address the issues thereby arising. Interference with course of criminal jurisdiction Sam also challenged the notice on the general ground of its capacity to interfere with the criminal proceedings facing him. It is, I think, important to bring out into the open a suppressed premise upon which that argument rested. It was that the notice presently requires CAP to do something. In fact, the time for compliance with the notice expired on 9 February 2009 and it is no longer capable of being complied with. There is presently no legal obligation upon CAP to provide the information sought in the notice. It would not be possible to obtain a court order to compel CAP to provide the information. In a real sense, the notice is spent. The possible relevance of the notice seems therefore only to be twofold: (a) Although it is no longer capable of being complied with, the non-compliance may have been a criminal offence. If the information which was originally required by the notice were now volunteered by CAP it might be relevant to any penalty which was imposed upon it. A related concern, I would think, is the capacity of the continuing failure to provide the information to constitute professional misconduct. Voluntary production may well be likely reduce the seriousness of these matters. The Board itself made this point in its letter of 6 March 2009 which in terms said: As the Board has not withdrawn its Notice to give evidence to the Board dated 16 January 2009, you are required to comply. Failure to do so may result in prosecution under regulation 168 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 . Any conviction may reflect poorly on your good fame, integrity, character and fitness and propriety. (b) It is possible that CAP may be prosecuted for a failure to comply with the notice. Despite these rather indirect incentives to provide the information to the Board, there was no evidence before me that CAP was proposing now to do so. David's evidence on this issue was: I wanted the Notice issue determined as I do not want to be prosecuted for failure to comply. I do not want to be issued with further notices that I believe are beyond what the Board is entitled to serve. Sam gave no evidence on this issue at all. There is, therefore, no evidence that CAP is intending voluntarily to produce the information previously sought in the notice. It is not the case that CAP is under a present obligation to provide the information sought. In that circumstance, the notice appears to present no real risk to the conduct of the criminal proceedings against Sam. Absent a real risk to the administration of justice in those proceedings, the notice should not be set aside on the basis that it constitutes a contempt: BLF at 56 per Gibbs CJ. Conclusion"
considered,Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618,"Court is required to make two main inquiries. The first is whether the applicant has made out a prima facie case in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the applicant will be held to be entitled to relief. The second is whether the inconvenience or injury to the applicant if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury the respondent would suffer if the injunction were granted: Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 ; Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57. Their Honours then referred to what was said in Beecham at 622: How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks. The debate which had existed as to whether an applicant for interlocutory injunctive relief required to demonstrate a ""prima facie"" case, or a ""serious question to be tried"", a phrase, derived from the speech of Lord Diplock in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 at 407 was resolved. These expressions may be used interchangeably so long as their meaning is understood. As their Honours said at [70]: There is then no objection to the use of the phrase ""serious question"" if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question, like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham , depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham ."

With respect to the third breach (the anticipatory breach), for example, there is a question as to whether a plaintiff's election to hold the party to the agreement rather than rescind means that it cannot claim damages. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that some authorities suggest that anticipatory breach entitles Coles to damages only if it terminates the Offer Letter: see Progressive Mailing House Pty Ltd v Tabali Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 14 ; (1985) 157 CLR 17 , 48 and Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 , 416-417, 441-442).

considered,R v Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; (1906) 3 CLR 770,"Caltex submitted that the residual oils were at no time ""delivered"" for home consumption because the concept of delivery in the Excise Act signifies a transfer of actual or constructive possession from one person to another. In this case, it said, there was no such transfer because it used the residual oils itself at its own premises. Caltex relied on a passage from O'Connor J's judgment in R v Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; (1906) 3 CLR 770 ( Lyon ), where his Honour in the context of the customs legislation dealt with the provision for customs control over goods ""until delivery for home consumption or exportation"" (which provision is mirrored in s 61 of the Excise Act ). His Honour stated at 784: The object of that provision, if it were necessary to give any reasons for its enactment, is obvious; if once goods go into home consumption, that is, into circulation, it becomes almost impossible to trace them. 136 According to Caltex, goods such as the residual oils which never leave its premises cannot be said to ""go ... into circulation"" and cannot therefore have been ""delivered"" for home consumption. 139 The Commissioner's submissions can be summarised as follows: (a) Upon their manufacture, Caltex did not sell or export the residual oils. It dedicated them for its own use as refinery fuel at the relevant premises. Its dedication of the oils for that use is plain on the evidence, which demonstrates that Caltex maintained and consumed the oils for that purpose. (b) The expression ""delivered for home consumption"" (ss 61 and 61C) is broad and should not be read down as applying only to delivery of goods between individuals or between places. Nor should ""home consumption"" be limited by reference to the identity of the actual consumer (i.e. whether the consumer is a third party or the manufacturer him or herself). (c) The concept of delivery for home consumption is critical to s 61(1) because it determines the period of the Commissioner's control over excisable goods. In s 61(1), the concept exists to distinguish between two places for consumption Australia (home) or overseas (export). The use of the preposition ""for"" in the phrases ""delivered for home consumption"" and ""delivered for exportation"", demonstrate the section is concerned more broadly with the place of consumption rather than the transfer of possession between parties. (d) The phrase ""go into circulation"" used by O'Connor J in Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 was intended to explain the concept of home consumption not delivered for home consumption. That much is clear from the context in which his Honour used the phrase, being an explanation of the customs authorities' control over goods as a form of security until payment of the required duty. Here, Caltex's premises are in Australia and consumption of the residual oils within those premises is sufficient for the oils to ""go into circulation"". (e) The residual oils were delivered for home consumption in a manner provided for by the Excise Act . They were delivered pursuant to Caltex's permissions under s 61C and that delivery gave rise to a deemed entry for home consumption: see s 61C(2). Accordingly, Caltex was required as a condition of its permission to include the residual oils in its weekly return and pay the corresponding duty. 141 Another way of considering this is by reference to s 61. Section 61 renders all excisable goods ""subject to [the Commissioner's] control until delivered for home consumption or for exportation to a place outside Australia, whichever occurs first"". The control residing with the Commissioner is of broad scope and is critical for the protection of the Commonwealth's excise revenue: see Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 and Collector of Customs (New South Wales) v Southern Shipping Co Ltd [1962] HCA 20 ; (1962) 107 CLR 279 ( Southern Shipping ). The section contemplates that excisable goods will be delivered for either home consumption or exportation. In my view the section evinces a legislative intention to cover the field in respect of all forms of internal (home) consumption and all exports. Historically, excise duties have been understood as running together with and supplementary to the customs duties traditionally imposed on certain goods. In Philip Morris Ltd v Commissioner of Business Franchises (Victoria) [1989] HCA 38 ; (1989) 167 CLR 399 at 427, Mason CJ and Deane J approved the following passage from Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth (1901): The fundamental conception of the term [excise] is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation of such articles of luxury, as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles and a corresponding or reduced duty on similar articles produced or manufactured in the country; and this is the sense in which excise duties have been understood in the Australian colonies, and in which the expression was intended to be used in the Constitution of the Commonwealth. 143 Contrary to Caltex's submissions, I do not accept that the reference in Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 to goods going into circulation necessitates a more restricted construction of ""delivered for home consumption"". Justice O'Connor's reference to going into circulation was used to explain how effective security over goods is lost once they have entered home consumption. His Honour was not there describing the concept of delivery nor, more importantly, intending to limit its scope. He was drawing attention to the policy of the customs legislation and the importance of the customs authorities' having a form of security over imported goods to ensure the payment of duty. I agree with the Commissioner that Caltex's dedication of the residual oils for consumption by it at its premises is sufficient, in the sense O'Connor J had in mind, for the oils to ""go into circulation"". 144 Similarly I reject Caltex's submission that the words ""from a place"" in s 61C mean that excisable goods must be removed from that place before they can be considered ""delivered"" for home consumption. Again, while Caltex's construction accords with what will occur in the typical case, the section is not limited to that situation. The section also accommodates and is consistent with a delivery for home consumption constituted by a use of the relevant goods at that place. Furthermore, the reference to a place in s 61C seems to me to be more concerned with the manner in which the Commissioner's control can be effectively exercised. Section 61C follows ss 61 , 61A and 61B , each of which concern itself with the Commissioner's control and the granting of permissions. In the case of s 61C , it seems to me that it is a necessary or at least convenient measure in permitting deliveries into home consumption without formal entries, that such activity is authorised only in respect of certain specified premises at which the Commissioner's control and supervision can be effectively exercised. 145 For these reasons, I consider that Caltex delivered the residual oils for home consumption pursuant to its s 61C permissions. Accordingly, if I am wrong on the ""refined"" point, then Caltex was obliged to account for the residual oils in its weekly returns and is liable to pay the requisite duty on them. 154 In relation to (b), Caltex's submission has the effect that s 60 could only operate where excisable goods have not in fact been delivered for home consumption. The Commissioner submitted that s 60 applies whether or not goods have been delivered for home consumption. He emphasised that the purpose of the Commissioner's control over excisable goods is to ensure that duty is properly paid (relying on Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 and Southern Shipping [1962] HCA 20 ; 107 CLR 279) and the obligations imposed by s 60 are designed to ensure that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without proper payment (relying on Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579). More particularly the Commissioner said that s 60 is aimed directly at the unauthorised relinquishment of possession, which would include delivering goods for home consumption in a manner that was not authorised, principally where there is no payment of duty."

cited,"Shark Bay Tuna Farms Pty Ltd v Executive Director, Fisheries WA [2000] WASC 79","was a good deal of debate before me as to whether the power in s 32(8) to vary or revoke a condition attached to a fishing permit could only be exercised during the period of the permit and for a purpose related to the fishing activities undertaken, or to be undertaken pursuant to the permit. That question raises difficult issues which I will refrain from addressing because it is not necessary for me to do so. I would only say that the decision to which the first respondent referred, Shark Bay Tuna Farms Pty Ltd v Executive Director, Fisheries WA [2000] WASC 79 , is, with respect, of no real assistance because it is a decision dealing with quite a different statutory scheme (see at [30]-[41] per Wheeler J)."
referred to,Citron v Z&uuml;ndel (No 4) (2002) 41 CHRR D/74 ,"her Honour found that the respondent controlled the Adelaide Institute and thereby was responsible for its actions, and for the material which was published on the Adelaide Institute's websites. She found that the material contained in the AI Document conveyed the imputations which were the subject matters of the orders mentioned above. She found that publishing material on a website which is not password protected had the effect of communicating that information to the public. Such publication allows persons who access the website with a browser to view the material. Her Honour described how the material moves through the World Wide Web by relying on the description given in the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in Citron v Z&uuml;ndel (No 4) (2002) 41 CHRR D/74 at [60]: The Internet is a means of global communication that relies on a universal set of protocols or standards for the transmission of information. Two related sets of communication instructions, Transmission Control Protocol, (TCP) and Internet Protocol, (IP), govern how information will move through the system, defining addresses, routing systems, and all the regulation necessary to permit communication among users. Her Honour also relied on the Tribunal's description of the World Wide Web at [67]: The World Wide Web, (the ""Web""), is a specific application that uses the Internet to send and display data, including text, graphics, audio and video. There are two active components on the Web: a server that stores and transmits information, and a client or browser that requests, receives and displays the information obtained from the server. A ""web site"" is a collection of computer files that are coded in a specific way ... to allow information to be sent on request to a browser. The files are then displayed in a way consistent with the instructions provided by the creator of the web site. Every web site has a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL), akin to their Internet address. Once connected to the Internet, the URL ... is necessary to gain access to a given web site ... Her Honour found that publication of the AI Document on the World Wide Web amounted to conduct which was rendered unlawful by the Racial Discrimination Act and made a declaration accordingly. Her Honour found that the AI Document and other material published by the respondent on the World Wide Web conveyed the imputations in paragraph 2 of the September 2002 orders. Her Honour found that the first and second imputations would engender feelings of hurt and pain within members of the Jewish Community who would, by reason of the publication, consider themselves being treated contemptuously, disrespectfully and offensively. She also found that the third and fourth imputations would offend, insult, hurt and wound members of the Jewish Community and engender the same senses. The judge found that the publication of the AI Document was unlawful under s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and that it was published because of the ethnic origin of the people in the group identified in the document, namely Jews and it was an act reasonably likely to humiliate and intimidate Jewish people. The judge found that the respondent had not established any exceptions under s 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act . Her Honour made a permanent injunction restraining the respondent first, from publishing to the public on the World Wide Web the AI Document or any document with substantially similar content to that document; and secondly, from publishing any material which would convey the imputations which she had previously found to be unlawful. The respondent's reaction The respondent appealed against the September 2002 orders. The respondent deleted all material on the website within the time prescribed by paragraph 1 of her Honour's orders. That action indicates an awareness of the September 2002 orders. However, some time before 23 September 2002, the material which was contained in the AI Document was again published on the same website. On 14 December 2002 the respondent attended the 3 rd International Historical Revisionism Conference in Italy and published further material on the website. On 5 February 2003 the respondent entered the September 2002 orders. Initially the respondent argued that the sealed order now on file did not reflect her Honour's reasons but that argument was abandoned. The respondent's appeal On 22 April 2003 the respondent filed an amended notice of appeal against the September 2002 orders. The notice of appeal did not challenge the finding made by Branson J that publication of the material was conduct which was rendered unlawful by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act , being conduct which was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate and intimidate the groups or persons identified by her Honour. Three matters were argued on the appeal. First, that Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act was unconstitutional. Secondly, the material which had been published on the website did not have a sufficient degree of causal connection with race, colour or national or ethnic origin as required by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act . Thirdly, the published material fell within the exemption to the provisions of Part IIA in s 18D. In May 2003, at or about the time the matter was heard by the Full Court, the respondent published on the website ""that the appeal would signal how strong the Jewish Zionist influence is in Australia's judiciary where a battle rages between common law and talmudic law."" The Full Court dismissed the respondent's challenge to the validity of Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act . Carr and Kiefel JJ found that the provisions of Part IIA were supported by the external affairs power. Allsop J found that Part IIA , ss 18C and 18C (1)(b) ""in its statutory context, are reasonably capable of being considered as appropriate and adopted to implement the obligations ... assumed by Australia"" under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination done at New York on 7 March 1966. The Full Court found that the AI Document was calculated to offend in itself those who maintain that the holocaust occurred and, in particular, Jewish people. It concluded at least one reason the AI Document was published was because of the race or ethnic origin of Jewish Australians. It found that the AI Document was deliberately provocative and inflammatory, and contrived to smear Jews. It rejected the respondent's contention that he was entitled to an exemption by reason of s 18D(b) which provides that s 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any publication made for genuine academic or other genuine purpose in the public interest. I disagree. The intention of the September 2002 orders is to prevent Dr Toben from continuing to engage in conduct that is rendered unlawful by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act . The September 2002 orders were designed to achieve that result in two ways. First, in paragraph 2 by requiring Dr Toben to remove from the Adelaide Institute website the AI Document and any other material which conveyed the imputations in paragraph 2(a)(iii). Branson J made that clear when she approved at [111] the approach taken by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal which considered the utility of making any order in a similar case. In the case of Citron v Z&uuml;ndel 41 CHRR D/74, the Tribunal said at [300]: Any remedy awarded by this, or any Tribunal, will inevitably serve a number of purposes: prevention and elimination of discriminatory practises is only one of the outcomes flowing from an Order issued as a consequence of these proceedings. There is also a significant symbolic value in the public denunciation of the actions that are the subject of this complaint. Similarly, there is the potential educative and ultimately larger preventative benefit that can be achieved by open discussion of the principles enunciated in this or any Tribunal decision. Paragraph 3 of the orders was designed to ensure that once there had been compliance with paragraph 2 of the orders, conduct of the kind which gave rise to the declaration in paragraph 1 would not be repeated. To that end, paragraph 3 restrains Dr Toben from publishing the AI Document anywhere on the World Wide Web and further restrains him from publishing material with substantially similar content to that document. It was necessary to include paragraph 3(b) because otherwise it might have been said by Dr Toben that he was entitled to publish on the World Wide Web information which was in slightly different form to that which was contained in the AI Document. Paragraph 3(c) of the orders is designed to reflect, insofar as future conduct is concerned, that which Dr Toben was obliged to remove from the World Wide Web website in accordance with paragraph 2(a)(iii). In my opinion, the orders are not imprecise or vague and uncertain. They do not become so because they require the party to whom they are directed to make a subjective assessment of the material which may be published on the World Wide Web."
referred to,Envestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 249,"Under Pt 3 - 90 of the 1997 Act , the consolidated group is treated as a single taxpayer represented by the head company. The assets of a subsidiary member are treated as being held by the head company. As already noted, the head company inherits the tax history of the subsidiary member when it joins the group. Plainly enough, the regime established by Pt 3 - 90 is intended to reflect, within the tax framework, the commercial and economic realities of corporate group dealings: compare s 700-10. See generally Envestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 249 at [6] - [9] per Mansfield J. As his Honour commented in Envestra at [6], ""[t]hat process obviously required rules, including to set the cost for income tax purposes of the assets that a subsidiary member would bring into the group"". Just as rules are needed for this purpose, so too rules are needed to govern the situation when a subsidiary member leaves the group. A subsidiary member leaves the group when it ceases to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the head company. 57 As the earlier discussion shows, the drafting style used in Pt 3 - 90 is a distinctive one: it specifically directs attention to the objects of the scheme as a whole and in respect of aspects of the scheme, and to the particular principles that are instrumental in achieving these objects: see e.g., ss 700-10, 701 -15(2) &amp; (3), 705 -10(2) &amp; (3) and 711-5(2) &amp; (3). The more detailed provisions, or 'rules', that are to be applied to give effect to these principles are to be construed in light of these principles and objects. 58 This appeal is concerned with what happens when a subsidiary leaves the group. The object of Division 711, which governs this situation, is set out in s 711-5, namely, ""to preserve the alignment of the head company's costs for membership interests ... established when entities become subsidiary members"": s 711-5(2). The means by which this is to be achieved is ""by recognising the head company's cost for those interests, just before the leaving time , as an amount equal to the cost of the leaving entity's assets at the leaving time reduced by the amount of its liabilities"": s 711-5(3). The legislation is directed to quantifying the head company's cost for membership interests ""just before the leaving time"", to be done in the manner indicated. This is the principle that is intended to achieve the object of preserving the relevant alignment."
referred to,Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341,"meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '"" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with""' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293. The word has been defined in various UK statues as ' failure to comply ': see, for example, ss 5(1) and 37(1) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (UK); s 53(1) Food and Safety Act 1990 (UK). Generally, authorities show that in ascertaining the meaning of the word the most important consideration is the statutory framework within which the word operates. For example, in Centennial Coal , Barrett J defined contravention as conventionally meaning that which was mentioned above, but went on to say: In the present context, however, ""contravention"" must be accepted as having a wider meaning. Section 1322(4)(a) is a remedial provision and the word ""contravention"" must, therefore, ""be read in a very wide sense""... Can one contravene an offence section if a defence is available?"
distinguished,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena (1971) 45 ALJR 426,"Finally, even if an item of expenditure cannot be traced to a particular item of income that fact of itself does not mean that the expenditure is not deductible: Total Holdings at 224 and the authorities there cited. However, an item of expenditure may not be deductible if it was incurred at a point too soon before the income producing activity commenced or if it was incurred after the income producing activity has ceased: Steele at [44]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena (1971) 45 ALJR 426; Riverside Road Lodge at 313; Amalgamated Zinc at 309 and AGC (Advances) at 197-198. 56 The phrase ""come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income"" was first used by Menzies J in Maddalena . However, that is not what occurred here. The Commissioner's reliance upon Maddalena is misplaced. The case is distinguishable on a number of bases. 57 The management fee was expenditure outlayed within a framework in which Spriggs, as a professional footballer, produced his income. That framework was the AFL Player Rules, the Representation Agreement and the Standard AFL Playing Contract. That framework has to be considered in context including Mr Shinners' evidence that it is rare for a player to negotiate his own playing contract and that he estimates 90% of AFL players currently have an accredited agent. 58 Moreover, the management fee was not incurred prior to the generation of the income. The income was ongoing. The income that was generated as a result of the negotiations of the Accredited Agent was, in each year (except 2004), from two necessarily related sources. One of those sources was the playing contract. The other was his additional services which he was able to provide only because he was a contracted AFL player. The term of Spriggs' playing contracts varied from between 1 and 2 years. For each year of each of the playing contracts negotiated by Connors of CSM, the Representation Agreement imposed an obligation on Spriggs to pay a percentage of his Football Payments to CSM. 61 Some analogies may or may not be apposite. And argument by analogy must never be allowed to obscure the particularity of the arrangements in question. Maddalena concerned an era of professional sportsmen and women which bears little or no resemblance to professional sport in the twenty first century. One only has to point to the absence of the electronic media, let alone the internet, in the 1930's to make good that proposition. Secondly, the factual matrix in Maddalena is very different to the factual matrix of Spriggs. 62 In Maddalena , Menzies J described the taxpayer and the issue in the following terms (at 548-9): ""The question is whether the taxpayer, who earns his living as an electrician and as a professional footballer, is entitled to deductions under s 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act [ 1936 (Cth)] of travelling expenses, and under s 51 and 64A of the Act of legal expenses, incurred by him in seeking and obtaining a new contract with a new club to play football. ... Of course, in his career as a professional footballer, a player who is successful ordinarily moves from grade to grade and from club to club. His employment is part-time and it is common for a player to play football in representative teams as well as with his club ... Furthermore, it is common knowledge that because a man is a successful professional he can earn fees from advertising and other sources which, of course, form part of his assessable income. Nothing I say in this judgment bears upon expenditure to earn such fees. Here it is the agreement with Newtown that the taxpayer spent money to secure."" (Emphasis added.) 63 Spriggs was a full time professional footballer. Maddalena was not. Spriggs seeks to claim the management fee as a deduction. That fee was incurred after the playing contract was signed, not before, and could not be charged if no playing contract was negotiated. Maddalena sought to claim travelling expenses and legal expenses, expenses which were incurred before the playing contract and which were incurred regardless of whether or not a playing contract was secured. The management fee incurred by Spriggs did not "" come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income "". 64 In relation to the ""negative limb"" of s 8-1 of the 1997 Act , the Commissioner submitted that even if the management fee was an outgoing incurred by Spriggs in gaining or producing assessable income, it was on capital, not revenue, account and therefore not deductible under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act . This argument also fails."
cited,Plantagenet Wines v Lyon Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247,"Although references occur in the Authorities to the 'inherent jurisdiction' of the Court ( McDermott v Richmond Sales (in liq) [2006] FCA 248 , per Kenny J; Plantagenet Wines v Lyon Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 , per Sciopis J) the term is an inaccurate description of the 'incidental and necessary power' exercised by a statutory court ( DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 241[25], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron J, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) as the term 'inherent jurisdiction' is a reference to a jurisdiction subsisting 'without the aid of any authorising provisions' ( R v Forbes ; ex parte Bevan per Menzies J, at p 7).

applied,Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (No. 3) [2003] FCA 651,"Honour further observed (at [8]) that the principles that govern the circumstances in which an order will be made under O 29 r 2 are relatively well established and she summarised them in a fashion which I gratefully adopt: '(a) the term ""question"" in O 29 r 1 includes any question or issue of fact or law in a proceeding. The distinction in the rule between an ""issue"" and a ""question"" is the distinction between that which, when resolved, will result in an adjudication in favour of one party or the other, being an ""issue"", and less decisive matters of dispute being ""questions"" ( Landsal Pty Ltd (in liq) v REI Building Society (1993) 41 FCR 421 at 425; 113 ALR 643 at 647); (b) a question can be the subject of an order for a separate decision under O 29 r 2 even though a decision on such a question will not determine any of the parties' rights ( Landsal Pty Ltd (in liq) v REI Building Society at FCR 245; ALR 647); (c) however, the judicial determination of a question under O 29 r 2 must involve a conclusive or final decision based on concrete and established or agreed facts for the purpose of quelling a controversy between the parties ( Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 334; 161 ALR 399; [1999] HCA 9 at [45] ); (d) where the preliminary question is one of mixed fact and law, it is necessary that the question can be precisely formulated and that all of the facts that are on any fairly arguable view relevant to the determination of the question are ascertainable either as facts assumed to be correct for the purposes of the preliminary determination, or as agreed facts or as facts to be judicially determined ( Jacobson v Ross [1995] 1 VR 337 at 341, referring to Nissan v Attorney-General [1969] UKHL 3 ; [1970] AC 179 at 242-243 per Lord Pearson; Bass v Perpetual Trustee at [53]); (e) care must be taken in utilising the procedure provided for in O 29 r 1 to avoid the determination of issues not ""ripe"" for separate and preliminary determination. An issue may not be ""ripe"" for separate and preliminary determination in this sense where it is simply one of two or more alternative ways in which an applicant frames its case and determination of the issue would leave significant other issues unresolved ( CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill (1985) 1 NSWLR 601 per Kirby P at 606); (f) factors which tend to support the making of an order under O 29 r 2 include that the separate determination of the question may (i) contribute to the saving of time and cost by substantially narrowing the issues for trial, or even lead to disposal of the action; or (ii) contribute to the settlement of the litigation ( CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill per Kirby P at 607); (g) factors which tell against the making of an order under O 29 r 2 include that the separate determination of the question may - (i) give rise to significant contested factual issues both at the time of the hearing of the preliminary question and at the time of trial ( GMB Research &amp; Development Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [1997] FCA 934 ; (ii) result in significant overlap between the evidence adduced on the hearing of the separate question and at trial possibly involving the calling of the same witnesses at both stages of the hearing of the proceeding: GMB Research &amp; Development Pty Ltd v Commonwealth ; Arnold v Attorney-General (Vic) (unreported, Fed C of A, Sundberg J, Nos VG 629-37 of 1995, 8 September 1995, BC9502745). This factor will be of particular significance if the Court may be required to form a view as to the credibility of witnesses who may give evidence at both stages of the hearing of the proceeding; or (iii) prolong rather than shorten the litigation ( GMB Research &amp; Development Pty Ltd v Commonwealth ).' As French J observed in Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (No. 3) [2003] FCA 651 at [8] : 'The overarching consideration informing the discretion to make an order under O 29 r 2 is efficient case management.' The Institute made the following submissions in support of its motion: (1) The conduct complained of by David Jones was not, on the Institute's part, conduct in trade or commerce for various reasons including that the media release and the further media release were not made for any business purposes of the Institute or Dr Hamilton but for the public benefit and to engender, participate in and foster public debate with the ultimate aim of, as suggested in the Discussion Paper, instigating improvements to the regulatory system for marketing and advertising of this kind. (2) An answer favourable to the Institute on the issue of whether its conduct is in trade or commerce would be a complete answer to David Jones' case; and (3) The evidence on the threshold issue of whether the conduct of the Institute complained of is in trade or commerce is discrete and totally, or almost totally, quarantined from the merits issues whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive and whether there was any contravention of the TPA. In furtherance of the submission in [16](3) above, the Institute submitted that the expert evidence in this case is entirely limited to the merits issues whether or not the conduct engaged in was misleading or deceptive and that apart from some accounting evidence, there is no expert evidence that could be called or would be helpful to the issue of whether the Institute or Dr Hamilton engaged in trade or commerce. This is why, the submission went, there is the potential for such an enormous cost saving and saving of court time because the contravention issues involve a very wide range of expert evidence, the nature of which is outlined in Ex. 2. It was submitted on behalf of the Institute that if there was an issue of credit, it might go to, for example, the sort of business the Institute is engaged in and the extent to which the discussion papers were published for a commercial purpose. Such credit issues would not be significant; they are not expected to overlap with the same issue on the merits part of the case; it is not expected that the same lay witnesses who would be called on the question of the business activities of the Institute would also be giving evidence about the nature of the advertising or the nature of the conduct engaged in by David Jones. Finally, the Institute submitted that, if there was a separate issue ordered and decided, the fact that it might generate an appeal was not a relevant factor. As to the possibility that the resolution of the question posed in a particular way would dispose of the proceedings or significantly shorten them with an attendant saving in time and money, one is reminded of what French J said in Olbers at [31]: '... any prophesied economies are to be balanced against the fragmentation of the trial of the issue. Experience in the courts over many years has demonstrated that fragmentation of proceedings rarely result in any saving of time in the long run and that projections as to costs savings are likely at best to be speculative.'"

The documents in question can be contrasted with the evidence of another Cadbury witness, Ms Caroline Shelton, who conducted a survey of persons' reactions to various colours associated with chocolate.

By contrast, with the documents in question there is no witness equivalent to Ms Shelton or Professor Layton. They are of much less probative value, the absence of the authors is prejudicial to Darrell Lea and their admission for all purposes would add length and confusion to the trial; see Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 378, 382."

cited,Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (2006) 224 ALR 490,"Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd (in liq) (2004) 208 ALR 242, Campbell J concluded at [68] that s 564 operates as an exception to the prima facie equality of treatment of ""all unsecured creditors within the respective classes which s 556 recognises"". Barrett J in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (2006) 224 ALR 490 accepted at [8] that as a matter of power the Court may under s 564 make an order that causes a creditor chosen for preferred treatment to rank ahead of ""any one or more of the creditors having claims within the s 556(1) categories"". That construction was said to follow firstly because s 556(1) is subject to Division 6 and thus subject to the power conferred on the Court by s 564 and secondly, because s 564 provides that a preferred creditor may be given an advantage "" over others in consideration of the risk assumed"". At [9], Barrett J said this: Section 564 contemplates that assisting or indemnifying creditors within its purview may be given ""an advantage over others"". The section does not say ""all others"" or ""some others"" or ""any others"". In referring to ""others"" generally, it contemplates, in my view, that the court may, by its order, give the assisting or indemnifying creditors ""an advantage over"" any one or more of the other creditors or all of them, with the result that the court may, as a matter of jurisdiction, cause the debts of the creditors in question to be placed on any of the rungs of the ladder of priority created by s 556(1) (and, within a particular rung, above, below or beside the creditors with claims that s 559 causes to rank equally inter se), above the topmost of those rungs or below the bottom rung (yet ahead of ""all other unsecured debts and claims""). In short, s 564 is cast in terms giving the court a complete discretion regarding positioning of the whole or any part of the debts of the assisting or indemnifying creditors on the scale of priorities in the winding up and the opening words of s 556(1) cause any such positioning ordered by the court to have effect despite what would otherwise be the order of priority under s 556(1). It is clear from the liquidator's letter of 2 June 2006 and cl 9 of the Indemnity Agreement of 6 February 2007 that the indemnity was to be provided by the Deputy Commissioner on the footing that where an amount was recovered or received by the liquidator arising out of the processes sought to be undertaken through the use of the indemnity, the liquidator would apply to the Court for an order that the indemnifying creditor would receive priority for the amount of the indemnity. That position was also an element of the proposal in relation to the further indemnity. Having regard to the expectations reflected in the liquidator's letter of 2 June 2006, it seems that the parties proceeded on the basis that property (an amount) recovered by reason of the various processes would significantly exceed the costs of recovery and would thus be productive of a fund of money from which distributions would be made in part reduction of the Deputy Commissioner's debt, after redemption of the indemnity amount. Part reduction of the debts of the trade creditors of $27,071.34 in the aggregate, may have been unlikely. In any event, redemption of the amount of the indemnity was to be a priority. The debt to the Deputy Commissioner was revised on 5 June 2007 to $128,927.61. In the result, the settlement funds fall well short of meeting the costs and expenses of recovery. The authorities ( Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (supra); Household Financial Services Pty Ltd v Chase Medical Centre Pty Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 294; State Bank of New South Wales v Brown (2001) 38 ACSR 715) demonstrate that in exercising the discretion consideration needs to be given to the risk run by the indemnifying creditor in providing the indemnity; the value of the property recovered or the sum recovered; the failure of other creditors to participate in providing an indemnity; the proportions between the debt due to the indemnifying creditor and other debts; the public interest in encouraging creditors to provide indemnities so as to enable a liquidator to pursue remedies which would result in recovery of the property of the company; and all other relevant circumstances."
discussed,Re Coles Group Ltd [2007] VSC 389,"In FT Eastment &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Metal Roof Decking Supplies Pty Ltd (1977) 3 ACLR 69 at 72, Street CJ said: [T]he court will not ordinarily summon a meeting unless the scheme is of such a nature and cast in such terms, if it achieves the statutory majority at the creditor's meeting [in this case, the members' meeting] the court would be likely to approve it on the hearing of a petition which is unopposed. That passage was cited with approval by the High Court in Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Goldmines Ltd [1993] HCA 15 ; (1993) 177 CLR 485, and has been followed in many decisions since, including recently Re Coles Group Limited [2007] VSC 389 per Robson J. 30 There may be some difference of opinion, or perhaps only of emphasis, between the views of Robson J in Re Coles Group Ltd [2007] VSC 389 and Fryberg J in Re Mincom Ltd (2007) 61 ACSR 266 as to whether it is necessary to consider s 411(17) at the first stage of the two stage process for the Court to direct the meeting and then, after the scheme is voted upon, to approve it. If that consideration is relevant at this point, that is whether there is a likelihood (or prospect) of s 411(17) being satisfied at first stage, I have the necessary level of satisfaction at this point and on the material referred to. The provisional view of ASIC referred to above indicates that there is a prospect of it producing to the Court the form of statement referred to in s 411(17)(b), although of course the Court then clearly is not obliged to approve the proposed scheme. Alternatively, on the information presently available to me, as I have indicated, I do not see a reason why, if the members of Hostworks at the proposed meeting of the scheme support the proposed scheme, I would not be satisfied that the scheme has not been proposed for the purpose of enabling any person to avoid the operation of any of the provisions of Chapter 6. That must necessarily be only a tentative and provisional judgment. However, it is accepted, as is now commonplace, that in circumstances such as the present, an entity such as Hostworks has a choice between following the takeover procedure in Chapter 6 in conjunction with Broadcast Australia or following the scheme of arrangement procedure supported by inter partes documentary agreements as contemplated by Pt 5.1 of Chapter 5 of the Act. Consequently, the mere choice of the procedure now being adopted is not an indication that a purpose of this procedure is to enable any person to avoid the operation of any provisions of Chapter 6. There will thus need to be some identification of which provision or provisions of Chapter 6 might relevantly operate so as to produce potentially a different outcome to that which would follow from the present procedure and an exploration of why the Pt 5.1 procedure has been used having regard to that provision or those provisions if s 411(17)(a) is to be enlivened. Such consideration may also be relevant to the discretion of the Court under s 411(17) if ASIC has provided a statement under s 411(17)(b). No such provision has presently been identified. 32 The performance risk concern has been raised in previous scheme of arrangement applications. They are referred to by Lindgren J in Re APN News 62 ACSR 400 at [23]. I will not repeat them. It is necessary to consider the so called ""performance risk"" of shareholders being left in a position, once the scheme has become effective, of their shares having been transferred to Broadcast Australia, but then facing a delay in the provision of the scheme consideration, so that their only remedy would be to sue on the Deed Poll. That risk has been overcome here by requiring the scheme consideration to be paid to Hostworks before 12 noon on the ""implementation date"" to be held in trust by Hostworks for the purpose of being paid to the scheme participants, that is the shareholders of Hostworks, before they are divested of their shares in Hostworks later on in the implementation date. Broadcast Australia must provide the funds to pay for the shares it is to acquire before they are transferred. A similar arrangement was satisfactory to Robson J for the purposes of authorising or directing the calling of the proposed meeting in Re Coles Group [2007] VSC 389 ; see at [38]. The Deed Poll contains a covenant on the part of Broadcast Australia to provide the scheme consideration on the implementation date in accordance with the terms of the scheme so that it ties the settlement step of payment and transfer together. 41 Under cl 7.3(a) of the Implementation Agreement, each scheme participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its shares in Hostworks which are transferred under the scheme will be free from all mortgages and encumbrances.

That category of case consists of circumstances where the party to the litigation is an insolvent person or man of straw, where the non-party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non-party, or some person on whose behalf he or she is acting or by whom he or she has been appointed, has an interest in the subject of the litigation.

The reason is that, in my view, on any approach, the discretion should be exercised in favour of the granting of leave for the Liquidators to appoint themselves as administrators. The main question under s436B(2) of the Act is whether the Court is satisfied that the liquidator is an appropriate person to be appointed as administrator. After all, a liquidator is at liberty under s 436B(1) of the Act to appoint another person as administrator without the necessity of leave: see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Foodcorp Pty Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 796 ( Foodcorp) ; Re Cobar Mines Pty Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) (in liq) (1998) 30 ACSR 125; John R Turk &amp; Sons (Artarmon) Pty Ltd v Newmont Television Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 622 ; Nardell Coal Corporation Pty Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) (in liq) (2003) 47 ACSR 122.

considered,"Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v Russian Kurier Inc, [1998] USCA2 315 ; 153 F3d 82 (1998) ","Mr Geller examined the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v Russian Kurier Inc , [1998] USCA2 315 ; 153 F3d 82 (1998). He treated it as authority for the proposition that copyright ownership issues are governed by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the property at issue and the parties claiming ownership. 45 Mr Geller noted that Itar-Tass has been applied by the District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division: Lahiri v Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution Inc 513 Supp 2d 1172 (2007). 47 Mr Geller has appended to his report copies of Title 17, the cases referred to above, and others. I have read the cases. I need refer only to Itar-Tass itself. The case concerned a copyright newspaper article, and had nothing to do with films. The Court first noted that Title 17 contains no provision concerning conflicts issues. It was necessary therefore to fill the interstices of the Act by developing federal common law on the conflicts issue. The Court said: Conflicts rule for issues of ownership. Copyright is a form of property, and the usual rule is that the interests of the parties in property are determined by the law of the state with ""the most significant relationship"" to the property and the parties. ... The Restatement recognises the applicability of this principle to intangibles such as ""a literary idea"". The Court then applied that rule to the facts of the case, which as the respondents pointed out, were much more related to Russia than are the facts of the present case related to Australia. But that is neither here nor there. It is the choice of law rule that matters, not the outcome of its application in Itar-Tass . 48 The respondents relied on the evidence of Mr Reichman who has undoubted expertise in copyright law. He disagrees with Mr Geller's opinion and believes ""there is a strong possibility that the US Court will apply US Copyright law to determine copyright ownership of The Secret"". He gives his reasons. 53 The second related deficiency in Mr Geller's report concerns Itar-Tass . He records the essential reasoning of the Court in that case, but does not advert to the note appended to the following statement: To whatever extent we look to the Berne Convention itself as guidance in the development of federal common law on the conflicts issue, we find nothing to alter our conclusion. The Convention does not purport to settle issues of ownership, with one exception not relevant to this case. The note (n 12) reads in part: The Berne Convention expressly provides that ""ownership of copyright in a cinematographic work shall be a matter for legislation in the country where protection is claimed"" ... Art 14bis(2)(a). The note goes on to explore whether the Article contains any implication as to the choice of law for copyright issues other than ownership. As indicated at [46], Itar-Tass did not concern a cinematographic work. 54 One of the attachments to Mr Geller's report is his article in Journal, Copyright Society of the United States of America (2004): Conflict of Laws in Copyright Cases: Infringement and Ownership Issues . At 326 Mr Geller says: To repeat our basic point: if a field, such as copyright, has a treaty-governed ""international system"", an ordre public international, such as the Berne/TRIPs regime, then the principles of that system, to the extent relevant to choice of law, must serve as binding constraints on conflicts analysis in the field. In terms of the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws, reading treaty commitments into the first criterion of section 6(2)(a), ""the needs of the ... international system"", help to meet other criteria of section 6. Because it is anchored in treaty principles, this approach enhances the ""certainty, predictability and uniformity of results"": The Restatement framework sets up two levels of conflicts analysis. We have already indicated that, at a first level, section 6(2)(a) of the Restatement sets out a number of criteria for generally resolving conflicts of law, the first being ""the needs of the ... international system"". The second level of analysis of the Restatement is found in provisions regarding special areas of law, for example, ... in section 222, regarding the choice of laws to govern [copyright] ownership issues. In such instances, the Restatement proposes to choose the ""local law"" of the jurisdiction which, with respect to the issue in question, has the ""most significant relationship"" to the ultimate facts of the case, but this relationship is to be determined ""under the principles stated in"" (italics added) section 6. Thus, in resolving conflicts of laws in cross-border cases under the Restatement, US courts are directed to attend to any relevant ""international system"" at the first level of analysis, in order to guide focusing on any arguable ""significant relationship"" adumbrated at the second level of analysis. Following the Restatement analysis in cross-border copyright cases, the courts should then take account of the relevant system, that is, the Berne/TRIPs regime, which the United States has implemented in the Copyright Act . Although Mr Geller does not refer to Art 14bis(2)(a), that passage provides additional support for attending to the provisions of the Berne Convention in any search by a United States court for the appropriate choice of law in a copyright ownership case. 55 Art 14bis(2)(a) directs one to the law of the country where protection is claimed. That is the law of the United States. Title 17 provides in s 104(b) that the works specified in s 102 , which include motion pictures, are ""subject to protection under this title"" if the work is first published in the United States, as the works in question here were. 68 (c) TS Production's registration under Title 17 is a clear invocation of the protection of the US copyright regime. The effect of that invocation is that under Art 5(2) of the Berne Convention, claims in the United States are governed by US law. (d) Drew Pictures has also sought to avail itself of the protection of US Copyright law. (e) The Film and the screenplay were first published in the United States. Accordingly that country is their ""country of origin"" under Art 5(4) of the Convention. (f) Title 17 grants copyright protection to joint authors of cinematograph films. If Mr Heriot makes out his case as a co-author of the screenplay and a director of the Film, he is entitled to copyright protection in the US, and it is irrelevant whether the works were conceived in Australia or partly made here. (g) Article 14bis(2)(a) of the Convention allows the US to legislate for ownership of copyright in a cinematograph film, and US law makes provision for joint ownership in films, which counsel submitted the Act does not appear to do. (h) Mr Reichman's expert evidence should be preferred to that of Mr Geller. Mr Geller's reliance on Itar-Tass is misplaced. Here the works were first published in the United States. That is their country of origin. Further, Itar-Tass observed that although the Berne Convention does not purport to settle all questions of copyright ownership, Art 14bis(2)(a) does deal with ownership of copyright in cinematic films this very case. (i) Australian law will apply in the proceeding in this Court. Title 17 will apply to the Illinois proceeding. There is no identity of issues because the two statutory regimes are different. On that basis there can be no anti-suit injunction to stop the respondents prosecuting their claim in the Illinois proceeding. (j) US domestic law will apply to infringement in the Illinois proceeding: Itar-Tass . (k) Where initial infringement occurs in the United States and subsequent infringement occurs elsewhere, United States law allows the recovery of damages for external infringement, at least if there is a causal link between the infringements: Sheldon v Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corporation 106 F2d 45 (1939). That is not the position in Australia: s 101(1) of the Act. Thus a cross claim for infringement in this proceeding would only cover damages for infringement in Australia. (l) Joint authors of films are not known to Australian law, and that is the central claim in the Complaint. The declarations sought in the Illinois proceeding that the works are joint works, that the respondents can exploit the works independently of TS Production, and that Mr Heriot is a co-author of the works, are not available under Australian law. It is common ground that amendment of the United States copyright register can only be ordered by a United States court. (m) The provisions of the Act relied on, namely ss 22(4) and 98, are quite different from the co-ownership provisions in Title 17 on which the respondents rely in the Illinois proceeding. 74 For the reasons I have given at [49] to [55], the US court will apply United States law to the ownership dispute. If the plaintiffs establish ownership in Drew Pictures, infringement and damages or lost profits will also be governed by United States law: Itar-Tass ."

referred to,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh (1997) 72 FCR 288,"Lloyd-Jones FM accepted the essence of the Minister's submissions advanced regarding the lack of viability of the appellants' claims as putative refugees. The Minister submitted that the Tribunal correctly determined their application adversely to them as at the date of the determination. In purportedly applying Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh (1997) 72 FCR 288 at 294 (Black CJ, Lee, von Doussa, Sundberg and Mansfield JJ), the Tribunal was evidently of the view that the appellant husband's circumstances the subject of his claims had not changed sufficiently since leaving Sir Lanka, and that the claimed threats were no more than further instances of circumstances which the Tribunal considered to have been evident at the time of the appellant husband's departure for Australia."
considered,Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536,"requirement of materiality is, by reason of the definition of ""disease"" in s 4, a requirement that the employee's employment contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment in question ( Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 at [16] per Finn J) or to the aggravation of the ailment, that is, '[i] n a material degree; substantially, considerably ' (the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary cited by Finn J in Sahu-Khan at [15]). Mr Mellor submits that, in his case, the correct question is not whether the underlying pathology of a disease or frank injury had been materially contributed to but whether the aggravation of symptoms, being an injury, had been materially contributed to. The worsening of symptoms of an injury can, he submits, be sufficient to ground liability without any change in the underlying pathology. That is, the Tribunal concluded that the employment was the cause of the aggravation represented by the pain but that the effect of that aggravation was not material because it was temporary and not severe. Is the requirement of materiality directed to the cause of the aggravation or its effect? ""Disease"" means an ailment or aggravation of an ailment ' that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment '. ""Injury"" means, relevantly, a disease or an aggravation of an injury other than a disease. In Sahu-Khan , Finn J traced the legislative history of and judicial consideration of the requirement of materiality, including the decision of the Full Court in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232. In Canute at [67], French and Stone JJ said that the term ""material"" ' imposes an evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded '. Justice Finn in Sahu-Khan adopted that analysis at [13]. It is the nature of the contribution that is necessarily material ( Sahu-Khan at [15]). The Tribunal correctly summarised the principles in Sahu-Khan at [227]. It appreciated that there was a requirement of materiality for a causal connection to be found. However, at [286]-[287], in considering the lumbar spine, it said that because there was no lasting effect of the aggravation and no underlying change in the condition, the contribution by the employment to the lower back conditions was not material. With respect to the thoracic spine, the Tribunal stated at [260] that it did not accept that the temporary increase in Mr Mellor's symptoms represented an aggravation of his condition in a material degree. This was to confuse the requirement that the employment be a material cause of the aggravation with a requirement that the effect of the aggravation be material. The confusion on this point is also evident from [225] of the Tribunal's decision, where the following statement is made: Mr Mellor claims that his employment contributed to or aggravated all of these ailments, and that the contribution or aggravation was to a material degree so that these ailments constituted an injury within the meaning of the [SRC] Act, and therefore he is entitled to claim compensation pursuant to s 14 of the [SRC] Act. (emphasis added) The Tribunal may have been led to take this course because of the way in which the cased was argued by Mr Mellor. Australia Post submits that the requirement of materiality qualifies the word ""ailment"" in the expression ' the aggravation of any such ailment; being ... an aggravation [of any such ailment] that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment '. I do not accept this to be the case. It is also inconsistent with the discussion of materiality in Canute and Sahu-Khan , although neither of those cases directly considers the issue raised in the present case. Australia Post submits that Parliament would not have intended that the Commonwealth be liable for any aggravation of disease regardless of how insignificant that aggravation might be. However, s 4 does not give effect to such an intention."

In In re William Hockley Ltd ... Pennycuick J. suggested as a definition of ""a contingent creditor"" what is perhaps rather a definition of ""a contingent or prospective creditor"", saying that in his opinion it denoted ""a person towards whom, under an existing obligation, the company may or will become subject to a present liability upon the happening of some future event or at some future date"". The importance of these words for present purposes lies in their insistence that there must be an existing obligation and that out of that obligation a liability on the part of the company to pay a sum of money will arise in a future event, whether it be an event that must happen or only an event that may happen. A building contract creates, as soon as it is entered into, an obligation upon the building owner to pay the contract price, either as a whole upon a future event or, more usually, by progress and final payments each of which is to be made on a future event. The event or events may not happen, but if and when one of them does happen the building owner, by force of the contractual obligation, must pay the builder a sum of money. It is, I think, nothing to the point that the event may be complex, as where the payment is agreed to be made when the whole or some part of the work has been done to the satisfaction of an architect as expressed in a certificate or to the satisfaction of an arbitrator as expressed in an award: the building owner is bound from the time the contract is made to pay money to the builder upon a contingency; and that in my opinion makes the builder a contingent creditor of the owner.' 72 Barwick CJ agreed with the observations of Kitto J and, inferentially, so did Windeyer J. Owen J found that the petitioning creditor was within the meaning of the expression 'contingent creditor' and therefore entitled to petition for the winding up of Community Development Pty Limited, although his Honour addressed other possible meanings of the expressions 'contingent debt' and 'contingent liability' in reaching that conclusion. 73 In The National Bank of Australasia Limited v Mason [1975] HCA 56 ; (1975) 133 CLR 191 Barwick CJ adopted the same approach as had been adopted by Kitto J in Engwirda . At 200 he said: 'There must be some present obligation to pay out of which the money may become due' for monies to be regarded as 'owing contingently'."

( Interfirm at 446) As to the general principles concerning the assessment of damages for breach of copyright, see Autodesk v Cheung (1990) 94 ALR 472 at 474 477; Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 111 ALR 269 at 285; Microsoft Corporation v TYN Electronics Pty Ltd (in liq) (2005) 63 IPR 137 and Eagle Rock Entertainment Ltd &amp; Anor v Caisley (2006) 66 IPR 554. Jennings contends that it does not licence its copyright to enable third party construction to occur. It keeps its copyright in a Jennings safe harbour and uses it solely in its own construction activity. Therefore, it is said, Jennings ought not to be treated in an analogous position to an architect who might, by reason of the nature of the professional work an architect undertakes, be subject to an implied licence of the copyright in a work produced in connection with particular projects. Nor, it is said, should the hypothetical ""construct"" of a notional willing licensor and licensee be adopted as the framework for determining a surrogate measure of damages by reference to a licence fee. The pleading claims damages on the alternative bases of either a fee for use of the plan or lost profits in the construction of the Bogdan home. Presumably, the pleading does so in order to preserve alternative possible formulations of a remedy in damages in respect of proven infringing conduct. However, it is clear that the letter of demand from Jennings dated 19 November 2003 made a claim for a fee for use of the plan for an amount which remains the amount claimed as a fee for use in the amended pleading."

As formulated, the submission is based on the High Court judgment in VEAL at [14]-[18] which refers to the judgment of Brennan J in Kioa v West at 628-629. Brennan J there referred to adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant which the decision-maker possesses and proposes to take into account. VEAL concerned an unsolicited letter from a third party which had been forwarded by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to the Refugee Review Tribunal. 484 In my respectful opinion neither Kioa v West nor VEAL is of direct relevance to the present case, which is not one of ""information"" of the kind referred to in them. The relevant information that ACCC ""possessed"" was that Telstra had implemented a churn process that required the participation of both the losing and gaining access seekers, and that neither Telstra (Bigpond) nor Request were participants in that process. This information came from Telstra or was at least known to Telstra. Furthermore, Telstra knew that ACCC's objective was to avoid disconnection charges in the case of an end-user switching service providers, and the information referred to was of obvious relevance to that objective. The procedural fairness issue raised in the present case concerns the solution arrived at and the reasoning process that led to it. This is a different area of discourse from that of information received by a decision-maker from a third party."

I need not set out those passages here. To those comments, only two matters need be added for emphasis, for the purposes of this case. First, provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court should be interpreted liberally and without imposing limitations not found in the express words: The 'Shin Kobe Maru' (HC) at 421. Secondly, a particular aspect of the importance of the context provided by the ALRC Report (otherwise discussed in The 'Cape Moreton' above) is the consideration referred to by the High Court in The 'Iran Amanat' at 138, as follows: The Australian legislation having been enacted against the background of English legislation and authority set out above, the definition of ""relevant person"" should be understood as having the same meaning as the courts had given to the corresponding words in the English statute. When the Parliament has enacted legislation, affecting the subject of international shipping, and followed a statutory precedent from overseas which has by then received a settled construction, there is every reason to construe the statutory language in the same way in this country unless such construction is unreasonable or inapplicable to Australian circumstances."

QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED IN THE APPEAL 1.1 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in the methodology it adopted to ascertain whether the applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accepted as a war related disease. 1.2 Was the Tribunal wrong in law by applying incorrectly or not at all sections 119 , 120 (1) and (3), 120A of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) and the decision of Deledio v Repatriation Commission ? [This is a reference to the decision of the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio [1998] FCA 391 ; (1998) 83 FCR 82 in which (at 97-98) the Court explained a four step process to be followed by the Tribunal in determining whether the applicant has established a link between his or her operational service and a medical condition which is relied on to support the payment of a pension]. 1.3 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in determining the diagnosis of the condition of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by reference to the statements of principle alone without regard to the expert clinical medical evidence of the psychiatrists who had interviewed the applicant? 1.4 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in failing to apply or to apply correctly all relevant statements of principle for PTSD? 1.5 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in failing to give adequate and proper consideration to the applicant's claim for the condition of osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand in its determination that the right ear hearing problem was covered by the accepted disability of hearing loss of the left ear? 1.6 Was the Tribunal wrong in law by applying Mines v Repatriation Commission which contradicted the High Court Decisions of Bushell v Repatriation Commission, Byrnes v Repatriation Commission and Repatriation Commission v O'Brian; and the full Federal Court Decisions of Repatriation Commission v Whetton and Deledio and Repatriation Commission ? 1.7 Was the Tribunal wrong in law by failing to provide adequate and sufficient reasons for its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based? 3. GROUNDS OF APPEAL 3.1 The Tribunal was wrong in law in the methodology it adopted in ascertaining whether the Applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of PTSD as a war related disease. 3.1.1 The Tribunal was required to determine first whether the applicant was suffering from PTSD before proceeding to determine if the disease was war service related. 3.1.2 The Tribunal conflated the two questions depriving the Applicant the benefit of the doubt in ascertaining whether he suffered a stressful event during his service. 3.1.3 The test adopted by the Tribunal throughout was that of the balance of probabilities whereas because of his operational service some of the circumstances surrounding the stressful events had to be given the more generous test of a reasonable hypothesis. 3.2 The Tribunal was wrong in law in the application of, or in the failure to apply sections 119 , 120 (1), (3), and 120A of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the decision of Deledio v Repatriation Commission . 3.2.1 These sections and the decision had application to determine the basis of a reasonable hypothesis whether the applicant had experienced a stressful event. The Tribunal erred in law in failing to apply the sections or the authority. 3.2.3 The Tribunal was required by law only to determine that the injuries claimed were not war caused if it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were no sufficient grounds for making such a claim (s 120(1) to do so it had to raise the test of a reasonable hypothesis based on all the material before it (s 120(3)). This the Tribunal failed to do. 3.2.4 The Tribunal was wrong in law in requiring the applicant to provide objective evidence that he had encountered the bodies of the children whereas the Tribunal was required to determine whether there was a reasonable hypothesis pointed out by the material that he had encountered the bodies. The Tribunal, although rejecting the event as being neither truthful nor accurate, did not challenge it pursuant to the requirements of s 120(1) , namely disprove it beyond reasonable doubt. 3.2.5 The Tribunal failed to apply s 120(1) to the circumstances of the applicant's case. 3.2.6 It was insufficient for the Tribunal to note that the circumstances of mortar and rocket fire did not accord with official records and that the events were not mentioned to two psychiatrists and to conclude that these were not traumatic events experienced by the applicant. It was not appropriate for the Tribunal to prefer the accuracy to the old official records of the events in relation to the shooting event. The Tribunal was required to ascertain whether the Applicant had been exposed or confronted with a traumatic event regardless of the position of the body or whether or not he had entered the tent. 3.2.7 The Tribunal appears to confuse between what constituted a traumatic event and whether or not the event took place. The Tribunal conflates these two questions to the detriment of the applicant. 3.3 The Tribunal was wrong in law in determining the diagnosis of the condition of post traumatic stress disorder by reference to the statements of principle rather than the clinical evidence of psychiatrists who had interviewed the applicant. 3.3.1 Post traumatic stress disorder was diagnosed by both the psychiatrists commissioned by the Applicant (Dr Cole and Dr Holwill) and the Repatriation Commission psychiatrists (Dr Walton and Dr Gelb). The Tribunal failed to take into consideration these reports and the evidence given. 3.4 The Tribunal was wrong in law in the application of the statements of principle for post traumatic stress disorder. 3.4.1 The Tribunal was required to determine the most favourable of the Statements of principle instead it used the more onerous. 3.4.2 The Tribunal was wrong in law in the standard of proof it adopted in determining whether the applicant met the requirements of the statements of principle for post traumatic stress disorder. 3.5 The Tribunal was wrong in law in failing to give adequate and proper consideration to the applicants claim for the condition of osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand and in its determination that the right ear hearing problem was covered by the accepted disability of hearing loss of the left ear when there was a loss of hearing to the right side. 3.5.1 The Tribunal failed to provide clear reasons for rejection of osteoarthritis of the fingers of the right hand in which it needed to explain why, pursuant to s 120 of the Act , it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was not war caused. [The appellant did not press this ground insofar as it dealt with hearing loss]. 3.6 [This ground was not pressed]. 3.7 The Tribunal was wrong in law in failing to provide sufficient and adequate reasons for its decision. 3.7.1 The Tribunal was required to do so pursuant to section 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Act ."" 18 Once the Tribunal had concluded that the traumatic events described by Mr Masliczek had not occurred and that he was not suffering from PTSD there was no occasion for the Tribunal to embark on the four step process which is outlined Deledio in order to determine whether a non-existent medical condition could be linked to operational service. 19 Mr Masliczek submitted that it was not open to the Tribunal, having regard to the specialist medical evidence, to find that he did not suffer from PTSD. This submission must be rejected. Only one psychiatrist gave oral evidence. That was Dr Walton. Dr Walton made a diagnosis of PTSD on the basis of the bodies' event, the shooting event and the firing event as described by Mr Masliczek. He did not consider that the taxi event or the casualty event were stressful in the necessary sense. Drs Holwill, Cole and Gelb, whose reports were before the Tribunal, also diagnosed PTSD principally on the basis of the bodies' event. As the Tribunal found, this event did not occur. The fifth doctor, Dr Kenny, did not diagnose PTSD. The evidence did not, therefore, compel a finding that Mr Masliczek suffered from PTSD. 20 During oral argument counsel for Mr Masliczek sought to argue that the Tribunal had erred in the manner in which it dealt with the general anxiety and the depressive disorders which it found, in paragraph [36], that Mr Masliczek suffered. He argued that the Tribunal's reasons suggested that these conditions had been found not to be service related because Mr Masliczek had fallen at the third of the Deledio steps: he had not experienced a category 1A or a category 1B stressor as defined in Statements of Principles Nos 101 of 2007 and 27 of 2008. It was argued that, in accordance with the Full Court's decision in Repatriation Commission v Keeley [2000] FCA 532 ; (2000) 98 FCR 108 at 123; 131-2, the Tribunal was required to consider whether earlier versions of these instruments, which were in force at the time at which the primary decision on Mr Masliczek's claim was made, might, if applied, have led to a favourable decision. These earlier versions did not contain a requirement that an applicant must have experienced defined stressors during service. The Tribunal had not considered the earlier versions. 23 Grounds 3.5 deals with Mr Masliczek's claim that the osteoarthrosis of the fingers from which he suffers was service related. The Tribunal held that Mr Masliczek did ""not satisfy the first step"" which was identified in Deledio . 24 In Deledio the Full Court explained the first step as follows (at 97): ""1. The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person. No question of fact finding arises at this stage. If no such hypothesis arises, the application must fail."" 25 The Tribunal noted that Mr Masliczek had attributed his painful fingers to injuries sustained while playing volleyball in Vietnam. It noted the reports of medical examinations conducted shortly after he was discharged from the Army in 1968. Those reports did not detect any injuries to his hand. The Tribunal also considered Mr Masliczek's evidence. The Tribunal determined that ""the material does not point to a hypothesis connecting the condition with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by him."" This conclusion was open to the Tribunal. None of the material pointed to the necessary connecting hypothesis. 26 Ground 3.7, as developed in argument, directed attention to the way in which the Tribunal had explained (or failed to explain) its reasons relating to Mr Masliczek's general anxiety and depressive disorders and his osteoarthrosis. 30 Paragraph 42 of the Tribunal's reasons has already been examined above at [23] to [25]. The Tribunal has adopted some shorthand expressions such as ""the first step from Deledio "". Nonetheless its reasoning processes, as I have earlier summarised them, are sufficiently clear, in my opinion, to satisfy its obligations under s 43(2B) of the AAT Act . 31 The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

followed,Saraswati v Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1,"I cannot accept such a construction. It is true that s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) directs a court to prefer a construction promoting the purpose or object of an Act. It is also true that patent textual ambiguity is not required in order to consult purpose (ie reference to purpose may be had both to raise as well as to resolve ambiguity): Saraswati v Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1 , 22; see also Kowalski v Domestic Violence Crisis Centre Inc [2001] FCA 1082 ; (2001) 113 FCR 67 at [23] . 19 Nevertheless, the purposive approach to statutory construction is not a carte blanche licence to courts to depart from unambiguous plain meaning. While purpose may sometimes be used to add, subtract, or clarify words in a statute or regulation ( Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22), ... where the text of a legislative provision is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context nor any purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning, the grammatical meaning is ""the ordinary meaning"" to be applied. A court cannot depart from ""the ordinary meaning"" of a legislative provision simply because that meaning produces anomalies[.] See also SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 at [44] - [45] (noting that where a party contends that a provision should not be given its literal or plain meaning, such a contention may lack force absent a plausible competing construction). The only exception to this rule is where the ordinary meaning would lead not just to an anomaly, but to a result that is ""manifestly absurd"" or ""unreasonable"": Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22; see also Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd (2007) 74 IPR 398 at [23]. 43 As noted earlier, a review of the statutory context, legislative history, and legislative purpose reveals an attempt to balance two competing objects: (1) the need to reduce barriers to entry and competition and thus reduce costs of patent attorney services; while (2) maintaining strict professional qualification requirements and thus safeguarding the public interest in receiving only high quality services. This understanding of context and purpose does not throw doubt on the construction of reg 20.3(3)(a) such as required by the High Court in Saraswati to justify judicial amendment of a statute or regulation that departs from the ordinary meaning. The legislative and regulatory scheme has hit on a compromise whereby in-house corporate patent practice (which would tend to be focused much more on out-of-court matters such as patent drafting and prosecution), but not ordinary law firm practice (which would tend to focus more on the giving of advice with respect to court-related matters such as validity and infringement proceedings), satisfies the registration requirements. This is entirely consistent with a legislative objective of partial deregulation while ensuring that high standards are maintained with respect to the complex technical arena of patent drafting and prosecution."
considered,Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10,"The manner in which s 153B is to be applied has been summarised as follows by Carr, Finn and Sundberg JJ in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315: [20] The Court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made. If it so finds, then the Court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. That is, the Court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time when the sequestration order was made, but also those facts now known then to have existed. The Court excludes those facts which have occurred since the order was made. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made: Re Frank; Ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396 ; Stankiewicz v Plata [2000] FCA 1185 at [19] ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23; Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347. These authorities, all of which were cited by the learned primary judge in his judgment, were accepted at first instance as reflecting the relevant law. The section thus contemplates two elements: the Court reaching a state of satisfaction that an order "" ought not to have been made "" and an exercise of discretion: Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [59] , [2006] FCAFC 179 ; 155 FCR 531 at 543 per French J. 40 Moreover, s 153B confers a discretion -- even if the Court is satisfied that an order "" ought not to have been made "", there thereafter remains a discretion as to whether a bankruptcy should be annulled: cf Delph Sing v Wood [1918] HCA 69 , 25 CLR 497 at 498 9, 505 per Barton, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23 per Gibbs J; Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 421 per Gibbs J. Relevant to the exercise of that discretion is Ms Samootin's solvency. Such evidence as is before the Court shows that she remains insolvent. The further Affidavit as filed on 17 July 2008 does not lead to any different conclusion. If the occasion for the exercise of the discretion had arisen, it would have been exercised adversely to her."

followed,William Brandt's Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co [1905] AC 454,"sale agreement did not dispose of or deal with any rights of old Boston to sue GE Capital for conduct in contravention of the Act. Whether or not rights to bring proceedings for damages under s 82 of the Act are assignable, in my opinion there is no reasonable prospect of success in new Boston's argument that the sale agreement effected a disposition of whatever rights old Boston had against GE Capital under the Act. Moreover, I do not think that, had the liquidator of old Boston sought to do so, new Boston could have prevented the liquidator enforcing old Boston's claims under the Act against GE Capital. Because of that, it seems to me that there is no reasonable prospect that it could be successfully argued by new Boston that an effective disposition of those rights had occurred. There was no communication from old Boston to GE Capital that assigned or made over whatever rights old Boston had in any respect, whether under the Act or in contract, to new Boston ( William Brandt's Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co [1905] AC 454 at 462). And, even though old Boston appears to have become deregistered, if the liquidator or creditors became aware that it had valuable rights against GE Capital, such as new Boston claims the rights it obtained under the sale agreement were, it is quite possible that steps might be taken to reregister old Boston to enable it to begin proceedings. I say all this because it seems to me to demonstrate the lack of efficacy of the basis upon which new Boston claims to assert old Boston's rights. I do not think that on the evidence before me there are reasonable prospects that such an argument could succeed. It may be countered that were old Boston reregistered, new Boston might be able to compel it to assign its rights in consequence of the provisions of the sale agreement. But no provision of the sale agreement offers reasonable prospects of success for new Boston to argue that it could compel the making over of old Boston's rights to sue under the Act. That agreement was silent on both that topic and the rights of old Boston to sue under that Act which were not part of the business the subject of the transfer. The damage which old Boston suffered, if any damage were suffered by the alleged contraventions, was a cause of action which appears, on any reasonably arguable construction of the sale agreement, to have been retained by old Boston. The sale agreement could not effect any assignment of the statutory causes of action to new Boston. It follows that GE Capital is entitled to have the claims against it under the Act dismissed on the basis that they have no reasonable prospect of being successfully prosecuted against it. No particular formality is required for an assignment for value to be valid and effective in equity. As Lord Macnaghten said in William Brandt's Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co [1905] AC 454 at 462: 'The language is immaterial if the meaning is plain. All that is necessary is that the debtor should be given to understand that the debt has been made over by the creditor to some third person.' As he continued, the real question is whether what is asserted to be an assignment is notice to the debtor that the assignee is 'interested in the money' ([1905] AC at 462). The letter sent by new, not old, Boston on 1 July 2005 in terms related future invoices to new Boston's ABN. It was silent about the payment of the debts due on any old invoices. But in any event, old Boston did not write the letter and so it gave no instruction to GE Capital. Whatever debt GE Capital may have owed old Boston on 1 July 2005 was never made over to new Boston. GE Capital could not have received a good discharge of any existing obligation to old Boston by paying new Boston, because old Boston never authorized GE Capital to do so."

applied,Trade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 527 ; (1991) 105 ALR 115,"For the purposes of s 42Y(3)(b) , it may finally be noted, the Secretary does not maintain that there has been "" any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention "". But, as was pointed out by Olney J in Trade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 527 ; (1991) 105 ALR 115 in the context of pecuniary penalties being sought under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act for resale price maintenance, "" an absence of loss or damage is not a mitigating factor "". His Honour observed at 118 19: ... The Act also requires that regard be had to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission. In the facts of the present case there appears to be no basis upon which any loss or damage can be identified. Whatever may have been the circumstances that induced all other Victorian distributors to agree to maintain retail prices at the levels nominated by ICI, it is the conduct in relation to MRW and Heinrich O'Loughlin which is the subject of these proceedings. Nothing has been said to indicate that either of these companies, nor indeed any of their customers, suffered loss or damage by the attempt to induce them to maintain a minimum price. However, I do not think that the absence of loss or damage is necessarily a mitigating factor. In a case where the breach of the Act is an attempt to induce a reseller to impose a minimum price for goods supplied to the reseller, the question of loss or damage will rarely, if ever, arise. The Act does not distinguish in terms of culpability between the various types of conduct which constitute the practice of resale price maintenance. The same conclusion was also reached by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [29] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 384 when considering s 24(2) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) .

cited,Re Tony Barlow Australia Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 1,"There is now a considerable body of case law on the nature of the discretion conferred by s 1322. In Re Wave Capital Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 418 French J indicated at paras 29 and 30 that: ""29. ... Like the discretion to validate invalid share issues under s 254E, the power conferred by s 1322 must be exercised having regard to the requirements of the purposes of the Corporations Act and any other relevant statutes whose application may be in issue. It must also be exercised having regard to the interests of all parties affected and the public interest in ensuring compliance with statute law and company constitutions. Evidence of a blatant disregard of the provisions of the Act or the constitution of the company may lead to refusal of relief: Re Onslow Salt Pty Ltd (2003) 198 ALR 344; 45 ACSR 322 and cases there cited.

There is a constructional question whether the time limits for seeking quotations referred to in ss 723 and 724 are time limits which can be extended by the court under s 1322(4)(d). The power conferred by s 1322(4)(d) is to make an order 'extending the period for doing any act ... under the Act or in relation to a corporation'. Section 723(3) does not in terms impose an obligation to apply for quotation within 7 days after the date of the prospectus. Rather, it conditions the validity of the share issue or transfer in response to an application under the prospectus upon the application for quotation having been made within that time. I am satisfied, however, that the ordinary meaning of the words of s 1322(4)(d) can readily accommodate the extension of the period for making an application for quotation. The same is true in my opinion of the 7 day period referred to in s 724(1)(b). This accords with the approach taken by Lindgren J in Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 702 at 707, [28] where his Honour said: '[28] Courts have had no difficulty in treating s 1322(4)(d) as being available even though the ""period for doing any act, matter or thing or instituting or taking any proceeding under [the legislation] or in relation to a corporation"" in question did not form part of a provision which in terms imposed an absolute positive obligation to do the act, matter or thing or to institute or take the proceeding.' - citing Elderslie , above: Super John Pty Ltd v Futuris Rural Pty Ltd (1999) 32 CSR 398; 17 ACLC 1242; Pinnacle VRB Ltd v Reliable Power Inc [2001] VSC 262 ; (2001) 39 ACSR 8; 163 FLR 215; 19 ACLC 1450 and Brown v DML Resources Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 6) [2002] NSWSC 6 ; (2002) 40 ACSR 669; 166 FLR 393; 20 ACLC 537.""

It is important to re-emphasise in this matter that as yet no shares have been issued pursuant to the prospectus. For that reason no question of invalidity as such arises at this stage, see s 254E(1) of the Act. Nonetheless, it is the case that extending time in a manner proposed in this application, that is up to and including 5 December 2007 (the date upon which the quotation application was in fact lodged with the ASX) will have the effect of depriving subscribers of a right that they would otherwise enjoy by virtue of the provisions of s 724(2) of the Act."

discussed,VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471,"The Minister argued that for the obligation to provide particulars under s 424A(1) to be engaged, the Tribunal must consider that the information to which it refers is adverse to the applicant for review's claim to have the review decided in his or her favour and must be integral to the decision. The Minister relied on a line of authority in the Court, in particular the decision of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 478 [33]. Moreover, the Minister submitted that to the extent that the Tribunal's reasons identified omissions in the claims made by the appellant in support of her application for a visa it was the omissions and nothing more which constituted the reason why, or the integral part of the reasoning why, the Tribunal came to reject the appellant's claim. In that respect the Minister relied upon what Finn and Stone JJ had earlier said in the VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 476-477 [24], namely: '[24] As to the first of these, there is now a considerable body of case law concerned with the compass of the term ""information"" in its s 424A(1) setting. The following propositions emerge from it: (i) the purpose of s 424A is to provide in part a statutory procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness: Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 429-30 [104] ; [2001] FCA 1196 ; 64 ALD 289 at 318. However the obligation imposed is not coextensive with that which might be imposed by the common law to avoid practical injustice: VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; BC200301782; (ii) the word ""information"" in s 424A(1) has the same meaning as ins 424: Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 ; (2001) 105 FCR 212 at 218 [20] ; and in this setting it refers to knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the tribunal: Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 ; BC200004607 at [3]; irrespective of whether it is reliable or has a sound factual basis: Win, at 217-18 [19]-[22]; and (iii) the word does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations: Tin at [54]; Paul at FCR 428 [95]; ALD 317; Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1679 ; BC2000108482 at [25]; approved [2002] FCAFC 120 ; BC 200203793; nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc: WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276 at 282-4 [26] - [29] .' 20 The task of statutory construction obliges courts to construe a relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions in the statute as is pointed out by McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381 [69] . When s 424A refers to 'the reason or part of the reason' it does not divide the reasoning process into what is said to be 'integral' from what the Tribunal is required to express as its reasons in the language of s 430(1). In VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 478 [33] Finn and Stone JJ discussed the need to isolate what their Honours termed to be 'the integral parts of the reasons for the tribunal's decision'. Their Honours said that task, necessarily, was an interpretive one. 25 Moreover, there is a number of judgments in the Court in which conflicting views have been expressed as to whether the general proposition in VAF v Minister (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 447 lays down a rule of general application that identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps etc. can never amount to information. In SZECF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1200 at [21] , Allsop J pointed out there may be a distinction, sometimes fine, but nevertheless important, between information which may be knowledge acquired by the Tribunal and the subjective appraisal or thought processes of it. His Honour concluded (at [2005] FCA 1200 at [29] - [30] ): 'If, as here, the very form and content of a statement (including what was not said) is central to the rejection of virtually all of the evidence of the appellant, I do not see anything [Branson J said] in NIAH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] 124 FCA 223 at [28] as necessarily inconsistent with an application of s 424A. To say that there is no information here because the statement (which is information) lacked the aspect now being adduced would be to fail to recognize that the information that is central to the reason for the decision is that the appellant said so much and no more on an earlier occasion. That is the relevant information.'"
discussed,Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works [1863] EngR 424 ; (1863) 14 CB(NS) 180,"follows from what I have held, that s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act does not apply to the application to discontinue. In the event that this conclusion is incorrect, both parties accepted that it was possible to grant leave for the proceedings to be discontinued and an appropriate order made protecting the rights of persons who were intended to be group members from the consequences of allowing that discontinuance. The sources of power to make those orders would be either ss 22 and 23 or (if I were wrong about the proceedings not being made under Pt IVA) ss 33V(2) , 33Z (1)(g) and s 33ZF of the Federal Court of Australia Act . Each of those sections is sufficient to enable the Court to make a declaration protecting the rights of third parties, being those whom the applicants sought to claim were group members. None of those third parties has been heard or joined. They have had no opportunity to protect their interests. Ordinarily (leaving aside cases or statutes excluding the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness) no-one should have his or her rights affected or destroyed without an opportunity of being heard. This principle was illustrated in the great case of Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works [1863] EngR 424 ; (1863) 14 CB(NS) 180 [143 ER 414] and remains applicable today: Taylor v Taylor [1979] HCA 38 ; (1978) 143 CLR 1 ; Commissioner of Police v Tanos [1958] HCA 6 ; (1958) 98 CLR 383 at 395 per Dixon CJ and Webb J."

cited,Ferdinands v Chief of Army [2003] FCAFC 10,"In his reasons for judgment, Ferdinands v Chief of Army [2008] FCA 1865 , Lander J refused to grant the extension of time sought because no proper explanation had been offered for the delay and because there was no prospect of Mr Ferdinands succeeding in obtaining an order setting aside the termination decision: at [41]. 4 Counsel for the respondents properly raised the question whether the decision of Lander J was an interlocutory decision or a final decision. If the latter, no leave to appeal from his decision was necessary. If the former, s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provided that no appeal lay from that decision without leave. Leave to appeal may be given by a single judge: s 25(2)(a). Under O 52 r 10 of the Federal Court Rules leave to appeal is given in accordance with principles discussed in D&eacute;cor Corp Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 , in particular having regard to two main considerations, namely, whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration by the Full Court, and whether substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused supposing the decision to be wrong. 6 I do not consider that decision dictates that the decision of Lander J in the present matter was a final order so that no leave to appeal is necessary. That is because this proceeding, unlike the proceeding in Paramasivam , did not seek to enforce an existing alleged cause of action which had become statute barred by the elapse of time. In other words, there was no claimed legal right which Mr Ferdinands was seeking to enforce. His application was for an extension of time within which to apply for an order to show cause why the termination decision should not be set aside. It was necessary for him, even had he applied for such an order within time, to satisfy a Justice of the High Court (or if the matter were remitted to this Court, a judge of this Court) that it was appropriate for an order to show cause to be issued. Moreover, as McHugh ACJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ said in Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 at [4] : the usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order, as made, finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. That question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not. If the legal effect of the judgment is final, it is a final order; otherwise, it is an interlocutory order. (original emphasis, citations omitted) 8 Accordingly, I consider that Mr Ferdinands correctly approached the matter on the basis that he required leave to appeal from the decision of Lander J. 9 Mr Ferdinands made detailed written submissions about why leave to appeal should be granted. In essence, he said it was in the interests of justice to grant leave. He briefly developed them orally. However, his submissions really amounted to no more than a way of describing the nature of his claim. They did not pay sufficient attention to the particular circumstances. I invited him to indicate where he contended Lander J had fallen into error in his consideration of that application for an extension of time to apply for the order to show cause. In my view, Mr Ferdinands was unable to indicate any such error either in the description of the history relevant to consideration of that application, or in identifying the grounds advanced by Mr Ferdinands in support of it, or in his Honour's consideration of those grounds. I shall advert to them again shortly. 10 There are two additional matters which Mr Ferdinands raised, apparently for the first time on this application. The first is his assertion that Crennan J had no power to remit the matter to this Court for hearing and determination. He had not objected to the remittal order when it was made, nor had he raised that point before Lander J. He did not develop any argument in support of the proposition. It is plainly wrong: see s 44 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Secondly, he argued that the delegate of the Chief of Army had no power to terminate his employment in the way that had been done because ss 5 and 10 of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (Cth) were ""involved"". Again, that matter had not been raised in his original application, nor before Lander J. No notice of that matter had been given to the respondents, other than in a generic way in his draft proposed notice of appeal exhibited to his affidavit sworn on 8 December 2008 where it is said that: That section 10 of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 Application of the criminal code is declared invalid in law, and all associated subsections are declared invalid including section 162 , 163 and 165A . No detailed argument was developed in support of the contention. As it was not raised previously, it is unfair to the respondents to have been confronted with it only on this application, and more importantly, as it was not raised before Lander J, it cannot provide a basis for demonstrating that his Honour's reasoning was erroneous and that leave to appeal from it should be given. 11 I return to the matters which were argued before Lander J. 12 Mr Ferdinands orally suggested in a general way that the history recorded by Lander J, and the description of the matters or grounds upon which the application to show cause was made were misunderstood by his Honour. Closer questioning of Mr Ferdinands indicated that he did not identify any particular respect in which his Honour misunderstood either of those aspects of his claim. I will not refer to the detail of them. He was unable to demonstrate any arguable error in those respects. 13 It became apparent in the course of his oral submissions on this application, that the thrust of Mr Ferdinands' complaint is that he was wrongly convicted in the Adelaide Magistrates Court of assault, and wrongly convicted by a Defence Force Magistrate of a separate assault upon a service personnel. He argued that the delegate of the Chief of Army was wrong to have taken into account those convictions in deciding to terminate his employment. As Lander J said at [8] in essence, ""he seeks to use the proceeding to show cause to overturn those convictions"". Moreover, as Lander J pointed out at [38], the proposed proceeding is an attempt to quash the decision by a collateral attack upon the conviction by the Defence Force Magistrate. 14 Mr Ferdinands was convicted by a Defence Force Magistrate of one charge of assault upon an inferior officer on 4 November 1999. He belatedly sought to appeal from that decision on 17 April 2001. The President of the Defence Force Disciplinary Appeal Tribunal on 15 August 2001 refused to grant an extension of time to appeal. He appealed from that decision also. On 16 August 2002, that Tribunal extended the time for filing of an appeal but dismissed the appeal. Mr Ferdinands then appealed to this Court from that decision. That appeal was dismissed on 11 February 2003: Ferdinands v Chief of Army [2003] FCAFC 10. He applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal from that decision. That application was deemed to be abandoned for failure to comply with the High Court Rules on 1 October 2003. As Lander J said, his application for an extension of time to apply for an order to show cause should not be granted when it was, or to the extent that it was, seeking to make a collateral attack upon that conviction. 15 The fact that Mr Ferdinands was seeking collaterally to attack the Defence Force Magistrate's conviction was reinforced by his complaints about the conduct of that hearing, in particular that certain witnesses had not been called and certain documents had not been produced which he claimed ought to have been produced on that hearing. 16 Mr Ferdinands raised an additional point on this application for leave to appeal, apparently for the first time, that he could not have been terminated by a decision of the delegate of the Chief of Army because, following that conviction, the prosecuting officer had asked for the termination of his employment, but the Defence Force Magistrate had imposed a lesser penalty. Hence, he said, the Defence Force Magistrate had decided that termination of his employment as a member of the defence force was not an appropriate penalty for the conviction, and the Chief of Army could not then reach a different view or impose an additional penalty. The proposition oversimplifies the grounds upon which the decision to terminate his employment was made. The material before the Court indicates that the facts and circumstances relating to the reason for terminating his service were that conviction, a conviction for assault in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on 27 February 2001, together with evidence about Mr Ferdinands' character then provided relative to penalty in that Court, the termination of his civilian employment on 21 November 2001, and more generally his attitude towards others and towards authority. The evidence does not support Mr Ferdinands' assertion. As the point was not raised before Lander J, even if it were correct, it could not show arguable error at first instance. And the proposition, even if correct, inappropriately conflates the punishment imposed for an offence with the assessment of suitability to remain in particular employment. 17 Mr Ferdinands also criticised the approach of Lander J in deciding whether there was an adequate explanation for the delay in making the primary application. His Honour properly identified the principles, as discussed by McHugh J in Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479 at 480. In my view, nothing was identified to suggest that his Honour has misunderstood or misapplied them. He recognised the disadvantage applicable to Mr Ferdinands by reason of his impecuniosity and by reason of his need to be self-represented. 18 So far as I can determine, although not dealt with in the draft proposed notice of appeal, the only other matter advanced on this application for leave to appeal was an assertion that Lander J had incorrectly struck out an affidavit of Mr Ferdinands of 4 May 2007 as an abuse of process. His Honour ruled that he would not receive paras [1]-[35] of that affidavit, but received the remainder of that affidavit. It was entirely proper to have rejected those paragraphs of that affidavit. They did not relate to any issue relevant to the primary application. They contained a series of unrelated and offensive allegations against persons who were not parties to it. The balance of that affidavit comprises matters which his Honour regarded as potentially relevant to the application which he was considering. 19 I have therefore come to the view that Mr Ferdinands' application must be refused. He has not identified any matter in which Lander J might have fallen into error, even arguably so. He has not advanced any matter which specifically explains the delay between the making of the decision which he wishes to attack and the application for an extension of time to have made the application. In those circumstances, neither of the principles upon which an extension of time might be granted has been activated. 20 The application is therefore refused with costs. I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield.

I am entitled to infer that the testimony would not have been favourable to Hume's case; Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418 419 (Handley JA). 47 The only other submission which I need to address under this subheading is not concerned with the question of authority. It is whether the email of 22 December 2006, attaching a copy of the letter of the same date, constituted written notice. 48 Counsel for Hume submitted it did not because an email is an electronic representation of writing and therefore does not constitute writing itself as required by Article 20(3). I reject that submission."
cited,Sayseng v Kellogg Superannuation Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 945,"Kowalski (No 2) I set out in relatively short form the principles governing the review of a decision of a superannuation trustee denying a member's entitlement to a claimed benefit. As I then indicated there is now a significant body of Australian case law dealing with that matter and many of the cases have involved claims for total and permanent disability benefits having criteria similar to those embedded in cl 1(6) of the Deed: see eg Jeffrey Guy Baker v Local Government Superannuation Scheme Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1173 ; Hay v Total Risk Management Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 94 ; Sayseng v Kellogg Superannuation Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 945 ; Flegeltaub v Telstra Super Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 107 ; Minehan v AGL Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd (1998) 134 ACTR 1 ; Vidovic v Email Superannuation Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Bryson J, 3 March 1995)."
distinguished,"Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc. v The Minister for Environment (unreported, Northrop, Burchett and Hill JJ, 27 May 1997)","IFT contends that the fact that Gunns was joined to the proceeding on its own application should be taken into account when exercising the Court's discretion to award costs. IFT relies on the case of Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc. v The Minister for the Environment (No. 1) (1996) 69 FCR 1 for the proposition that it is appropriate to deny Gunns its costs in circumstances where it was joined to the proceeding as an interested person on its own application. In Friends of Hinchinbrook , Branson J imposed a condition on the joinder that the additional respondent not seek its costs in the proceeding. That decision was upheld on appeal: Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc. v The Minister for Environment (unreported, Northrop, Burchett and Hill JJ, 27 May 1997)."
cited,Gordon v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 603,"Although s 51A does not prescribe a rate of interest, the usual practice in the Federal Court has been to adopt the rates of interest applied in the Supreme Court of the State in which the application is commenced unless there is evidence that the rates are penal or not commercial: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 at [7] , Gordon v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 603. The current rate of interest prescribed under s 47 Supreme Court Act 1995 (Qld) is 10% per annum. No submissions were made by the parties as to an appropriate rate of interest. I consider that the rate of interest of 10% per annum under the Supreme Court Act should be applied."
cited,Review Australia Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1009 ,"The plaintiff must, however, show that it has an arguable case against the proposed defendant to the standard or being able to resist an application for summary judgment by the proposed respondent had that proposed party been sued in separate proceedings: Review Australia Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1009 at [5] . 7 I have read the affidavits of the several investors together with the affidavits of Mr Jones, to which I have referred. The evidence which establishes at least an arguable case includes relevantly: (a) The existence, at all material times, of the relevant companies, namely: (i) the proposed eighth defendant; and (ii) Firepower Holdings Group Limited. (b) The issue of shares in Firepower to Green Triton on 2 June 2005. (c) The absence at all material times of a prospectus, profile statement or offer information statement lodged with the plaintiff in relation to any offer of shares in Firepower: s 727(1). (d) The fact that the shares that were the subject of the alleged contravening offers made by the eighth defendant were among those issued to it on 2 June 2005. (e) The purpose of the issue of the shares to Green Triton was the sale or transfer of the shares: s 707(3), which is to be inferred on the basis of s 707(4) from the sales of shares by Green Triton that are described in the affidavits of Geoffrey Allan, Carol Ashworth, Darryl Edmondson and Nicholas Furlan, and from the transcript of Timothy Francis Johnston on 4 March 2008. In the transcript, Mr Johnston is recorded to say that, in effect, the eighth defendant was (among other things) to bring funds into Firepower through the sale of shares. (f) The alleged contravening offers were made by the first defendant, Axis International Management Pty Ltd as agent on behalf of the eighth defendant. (g) The fact that those offers were made on behalf of the eighth defendant, is referred to in the transcript of the examination of Timothy Francis Johnston on 5 March 2008. In the transcript, Mr Johnston is recorded to say that, in effect, the sixth defendant, Quentin Ward, in his position with the first defendant, had authority to make the offers shown in the share register on behalf of the eighth defendant. (h) The absence of the exemptions set out in ss 708 and 708A: see s 707(3). The exemptions that are potentially relevant for the purpose of this application are those set out in ss 708(8) (sophisticated investors); 708(10) (offer through financial advisers); 708(11) (professional investors - to be read together with the definition of that term in section 9); 708(12) (offers to person associated with Firepower) and 708A(5), (11) and (12) (certain offers of quoted securities). The Investor Affidavits establish, to the requisite degree of proof, the absence of the exemptions found in s 708. Section 708A does not apply because Firepower has never been listed. 8 In the current proceedings Green Triton should be joined as the eighth defendant, in my opinion, as it is a party necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceeding may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon and, furthermore, ought to have been joined and indeed would have been joined save for the fact that it was thought to have been deregistered at the time proceedings commenced. I will accordingly make an order in terms of para 1 of the motion."
referred to,Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243,"Mr Grigor-Scott's case has failed moreover to confront and answer the nature and the extent of the findings and reasoning of this Court in Jones v Toben , both at first instance and on appeal, to which authority I have of course earlier made reference. There was ample corresponding support in the present case for the making here of similar findings to those made in Jones v Toben . Moreover it is unnecessary for me to determine the validity of the second respondent's assertions regarding the Holocaust. Hely J observed in Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243 at [176] - [177] as follows: '176. I am not in a position to determine, as a matter of fact, whether the claim made by the author of the pamphlet that the Holocaust never occurred is true or not. I do not have the evidence which would be needed to enable me to make that determination, assuming that the matter is susceptible of proof in a court. As Gray J observed in Irving v Penguin Books Ltd [2000] EWHC QB 115 at [1.3] , that is a task for historians whose role it is to provide an accurate narrative of past events; whereas my role is to determine whether the public dissemination of the leaflet by Mrs Scully in Launceston contravenes s 18C of the RDA. 177. In my view, a leaflet that conveys an imputation that Jews are fraudulent, liars, immoral, deceitful and part of a conspiracy to defraud the world is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate Jews in Australia. This would be so regardless of whether or not the leaflet made mention of the Holocaust. However, the fact that the imputation arises in the context of a debate about the Holocaust makes it even more likely that the leaflet would cause offence. This is particularly so owing to the inflammatory language used in the leaflet, as well as the fact that it is unambiguously dismissive of the Jewish view of the Holocaust. I therefore find that this leaflet contravenes s 18C.' I think it is appropriate for me to refrain from addressing further what appears in the evidence as to Mr Grigor-Scott's apparent views concerning the occurrence or otherwise of the Holocaust. 65 In the result the application by Mr Jones made on his own part and on behalf of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry should be granted, and the relief sought thereby should be ordered in principle. Given however that the BBC does not have legal personality, not being an incorporated entity as I have earlier explained, no order may be made against what is merely a name or description, though of course restraints may be made against future conduct of Mr Grigor-Scott as to causing or committing proscribed conduct to occur, including proscribed conduct undertaken in the name of the BBC. I should add that the applicant's amended application sought inter alia an order that the second respondent, Mr Grigor-Scott, deliver to the applicant a written statement of apology. I consider such an order to be inappropriate. I refer in that regard to the observation of Branson J in Jones v Toben (2002) 71 ALD 629 at [106], where her Honour stated as follows: '...I do not consider it appropriate to seek to compel the respondent to articulate a sentiment that he plainly enough does not feel. As Hely J pointed out in Jones v Scully at [245] , ""prima facie the idea of ordering someone to make an apology is a contradiction in terms""...' The second respondent must pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings, including any previously reserved costs. I certify that the preceding sixty-five (65) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.

cited,Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1,"However, the application of general principles concerning the nature of interlocutory judgments establishes that dismissal pursuant to r 44.12(2) is interlocutory in nature. See Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 and Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; (2004) 136 FCR 344 , as cited in SZKCV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1201 per Jessup J at [3]. The test whether an order is interlocutory or final is whether the order made finally determines the legal rights of the parties in the principal proceeding before the Court: Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225. Regard must be had to the legal, as distinct from the practical, effect of the judgment: SZDGN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCA 1543 at [3] per Lindgren J. It is clear, in my view, that Scarlett FM's decision to dismiss the application on the basis that it disclosed no arguable case for the relief sought must be regarded, as the authorities stand, as interlocutory."
cited,Maritime Union of Australia v CSL Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 113 IR 326,"As indicated above, I have concluded that each of Mr McGill and Mr O'Connell was refused approval to take leave on 15 November 2005 because he proposed to attend the Day of Protest. I also accept that a threat was made to dock Mr McAninly's pay for the time that he spent at the Day of Protest because he attended the Day of Protest. However, despite the link discussed above between attendance at the Day of Protest and membership of an industrial association, I am satisfied that the relevant determinations made by officers of ACS, ATO, DVA and DEST respectively were not made because employees affected by the determinations were members of an industrial association. Rather the evidence shows that the immediate or operative reason for the determinations was the circulation of the DEWR Advice ( Maritime Union of Australia v CSL Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 113 IR 326 at [54]). The determinations were a direct consequence of the contravention of s 298K(1) that resulted from the circulation of the DEWR Advice. They illustrate how the DEWR Advice altered the position of Commonwealth employees who were members of CPSU to the employees' prejudice. The officers concerned felt obliged to ensure that their respective agencies complied with the DEWR Advice."
cited,Millar &amp; Lang Ltd v Polak [1908] 1 Ch 433,"Certainly for something to be a ""drawing"" for copyright purposes no great complexity or (as the statute tells us) artistic quality is required. In Millar &amp; Lang Ltd v Polak [1908] 1 Ch 433 the works held to be drawings included words such as ""Greetings"", ""Friends ever"". ""Good luck"", ""Lest we forget"", and ""For old times sake"" in a distinctive form within an ornamental oval or circular scroll. In Roland Corporation v Lorenzo &amp; Sons Pty Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 111 the devices held by Pincus J to be drawings were based on the letters R and B but, as is apparent from the report at 112, were quite stylised. As his Honour said at 114, they were ""by no means random and were plainly drawn with care, to obtain an effect"". Clearly a letter or letters of the alphabet can provide the subject matter for a drawing. One thinks of the illuminated manuscripts of medieval works such as the Book of Kells. However, in the present case the text is fulfilling a semiotic function. It is communicating to the reader the message that within the cardboard box will be found a wooden photo box with 6 albums which hold 120 10 x 15 cm photos. The pictorial image of that box is conveyed by a photograph, which is not a drawing."

A court should not be too ready to disallow costs simply because a party has failed upon an issue, unless it be quite a separate and distinct issue from the issues in respect of which it succeeded or unless there be some element of unreasonableness or inappropriate conduct in relation to that issue: cf Verna Trading Pty Ltd v New India Assurance Pty Ltd [1991] 1 VR 129 at 152-154."""
discussed,Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth of Australia [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129,"reason was identified as to why the cross demand could not have been set up in the defamation action. Even if it is appropriate to attribute to the applicant the statement of the applicant's husband that he was not advised that he could bring a cross demand, such a reason is not sufficient to show that the cross demand could not have been set up in the defamation action. In Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth of Australia [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129 , Hill J said (at 132): ""What emerges here is that the practical reason why no action was taken against the Commonwealth, whether by the institution of a cross-claim or otherwise, is that the debtor was not advised that he could do so. But that does not suffice to make the claim one which the debtor could not have set up in the Commonwealth proceedings. That is not a question to be determined by reference to practicalities; it is a question to be answered by reference to legal considerations: Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 44 FLR 135 ; Re James; Ex parte Carter Holt Harvey Roofing (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 183 ; Walton v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd [1994] FCA 1114 ; (1994) 49 FCR 406 at 408; Re Scott; Ex parte Scott v Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd [1994] FCA 1379 ; (1994) 53 FCR 324 ; Re Martinovic (unreported, Federal Court, Kiefel J, 23 June 1995). Thus the mere fact that there was an excuse as to why the cross-claim was not brought will not avail a debtor seeking to come within s 41(7) of the Act, if a cross-claim could legally have been brought."" I accept the respondent's fourth submission. I am not satisfied that a cross demand in relation to the first publication could not have been set up in the defamation action. Second publication The USFA published a bulletin to the Ukrainian community throughout Australia, including South Australia. In Volume 15, July-September 2002, there was an article which referred to the applicant in defamatory terms. The evidence of the applicant's husband as to the respondent's involvement in the publication was as follows: ""I refer to the affidavit of Mr Whittaker of 22 December 2008 and to the exhibit thereto, namely a translation of the USFA Bulletin 15 of July September 2002. The USFA bulletin was published throughout Australia to the Ukrainian community including in South Australia. I have been informed by my wife whom I verily believe that she was told by the then chairman of the USFA Mr Jurko Suchowerskyj, who took over that position when Dr Motyka was not re-elected that Dr Motyka was the author of the defamatory statements about me contained in it. We have attempted to contact Mr Suchowerskyj recently but he now denies his previous statement."""
cited,Desktop and Autodesk Inc v Dyason [1992] HCA 2 ; (1992) 173 CLR 330,"The respondents invited me to infer from the evidence that the third party sources would attract copyright since it might be inferred that the sources had been produced in the last fifty years. The respondents cited Desktop and Autodesk Inc v Dyason [1992] HCA 2 ; (1992) 173 CLR 330 in support of the proposition that there could be no originality in a work that derived ""from other copyright sources without permission (or acknowledgement)"". This was, so they said, due to a lack of originality. These two cases concerned copyright in factual information and, accordingly, are not directly in point in the present case. In any event, I would reject the respondents' basic submission on two bases. First, I accept that, as the applicants submitted, it would be a question of fact in each case as to whether the applicants had infringed copyright in any particular pre-existing work. Secondly, even if copyright in a pre-existing work was infringed, the proposition for which the respondents contend is unsupported by the authorities and authors learned in the field of copyright."

cited,Hepples v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 22 FCR 1,"The Commissioner further submitted that '[t]he parties have clearly intended [Lend Lease's contractual rights] to be assignable, in the light of clause 20 of the FPA ( ante ). Moreover I was referred by the Commissioner to clause 22 of the FPA, headed 'No Merger', which stipulates as follows: 'The rights and obligations of the parties will not merge on completion of any transaction under the [FPA]. They will survive the execution and delivery of any assignment or other document entered into for the purpose of implementing any transaction.' In that context it was said by the Commissioner that labelling the contractual rights and obligations of each party as 'personal' did not conclude the issue, and that whether contractual rights 'are truly to be seen as ""personal"" is a question of construction in all the circumstances', citing in that regard well-known authority. I was also referred to the observations of Gummow J (as a member of a Full Federal Court) in Hepples v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 22 FCR 1. In relation to the operation of the statutory definition of asset , his Honour observed (at 27): 'In my view, rights which are not proprietary in character... whether because they are personal rights or because they are ""rights"" merely in some popular sense, are not ""assets"" within the meaning of s 160A of the Act.' It was submitted that the foregoing position so adopted by the Commissioner was '... not at odds with the observations' of his Honour."

cited,Spitzel v Chinese Corporation (1899) 80 LT 347,"There was some debate between the Commissioner and the taxpayer as to the significance of share allotment and issue. In the circumstances, it does not seem to me necessary to explore this issue in any detail. Speaking generally, there will be an allotment when there is a binding contract to issue and take shares and an appropriation of shares, usually by the directors, to the intending member: Commonwealth Homes and Investment Company Limited v Smith [1937] HCA 73 ; (1937) 59 CLR 443 at 461, Dixon J; Central Piggery Co Ltd v McNicoll and Hurst [1949] HCA 19 ; (1949) 78 CLR 594 at 599 per Dixon J, quoting Spitzel v Chinese Corporation (1899) 80 LT 347 at 351 per Stirling J; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Helens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 4 ; (1981) 146 CLR 336 at 371 per Mason J. Plainly enough, an allottee acquires rights against the company, depending in part on the nature of the contract between the intending member and the company. These rights do not, however, turn the allottee into a member holding the shares. This will happen only when the shares ""issue"", that is, when the shareholder is ""put in control of the shares allotted"": see Central Piggery 78 CLR at 599-600 per Dixon J."
referred to,Dart Industries Inc v D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101,"An account of profits is an alternative remedy to damages: see Patents Act 1990 , s 122(1). Its purpose is not to compensate the patentee, nor to punish the infringer, but rather to prevent the unjust enrichment of the infringer at the expense of the patentee: Dart Industries Inc v D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101 at 110-111. By reference to the judgment in Dart v D&eacute;cor [1993] HCA 54 ; 179 CLR 101 and the cases there cited, I have approached the calculation of the account of profits in this case on the following basis. The infringers should account for the actual profit that they have gained from the infringement. In calculating those profits, it is appropriate to deduct costs directly attributable to selling and delivering infringing articles from the revenue made from such sales and deliveries. It may be appropriate to deduct a proportion of general overhead costs such as plant, equipment and managerial costs. The deduction of such costs depends upon their being shown to have been attributable to the sales, the onus for which demonstration is upon the infringers. The account of profits is a discretionary remedy and the Court may decline to grant the remedy in respect of profits made by the infringer during the period in which it was unaware of the applicant's rights. In this latter respect, see in particular Colbeam Palmer v Stock Affiliates Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 50 ; (1968) 122 CLR 25 at 33-36 and the Patents Act 1990 , s 123 which is in the following terms: (1) A court may refuse to award damages, or to make an order for an account of profits, in respect of an infringement of a patent if the defendant satisfies the court that, at the date of the infringement, the defendant was not aware, and had no reason to believe, that a patent for the invention existed. (2) If patented products, marked so as to indicate that they are patented in Australia, were sold or used in the patent area to a substantial extent before the date of the infringement, the defendant is to be taken to have been aware of the existence of the patent unless the contrary is established. (3) Nothing in this section affects a court's power to grant relief by way of an injunction."
cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd [2001] HCA 32 ; (2001) 207 CLR 235,"An important feature related to the management fees is the method whereby obligations under the limited recourse loan agreements and the management agreements were met. In this respect, I am referring to the endorsing and later cancellation of the bills of exchange in the manner I have described. It was very similar to a ""round robin"" of cheques which, although effective as a matter of law ( Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471 at 486-487 [46] - [47] ) is, as Hill J pointed out in Sleight (at 232 [77]), a feature of many tax avoidance schemes. The method by which the moneys to be paid under the limited recourse loan agreements were paid by the lender and then in turn paid to the manager was known to the members of the CECK partnership because they endorsed the bills of exchange. Even if it was unknown, as might have been the case with the applicants involved in the TVA Project because the bills of exchange were endorsed by Plutora as duly appointed agent and attorney of Civil and Earth, the method of payment is still a matter to be taken into account.

referred to,KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354,"When applying these principles, the Court must balance the need for the expeditious conduct of litigation, particularly in a court committed to a case management system, and the ""the strong reluctance of courts to prevent litigants having a proper opportunity to present their cases"": KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354 per Tamberlin J. Ms Wu's motion must also be considered in light of the other powers of the Court to sanction non-compliance, such as the use of costs orders. 52 The history of this matter is troubling. The first and second respondents have been in default numerous times in the course of this proceeding. They filed their first lists of discoverable documents on 18 February 2004, over three months after the original deadline and over a month after orders by consent that they be filed by 15 January 2004. Moreover, these lists were filed only after Ms Wu brought two motions for compliance. Subsequent to this, Ms Wu has been required to take extraordinary steps to secure inspection of documents. 53 In addition, it is clear that Ms Wu has been frustrated by other action, or inaction, by these respondents, even if not amounting to non-compliance with court orders. The application for substituted service, the initial failure to seek to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, the failure of the respondents personally to attend mediation, the resignation of Barry Armitage from office in Avin, and the frequent changes in legal representation are matters that have undoubtedly caused Ms Wu vexation and have made the conduct of litigation more difficult than it would otherwise have been. Having regard to their conduct, I find that the first and second respondents have failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence. They are therefore in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules."
cited,Davis-Hurst v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) (2003) 198 ALR 315,"On 4 December 2003, after a contested hearing in the above proceedings, I ordered that the present applicant, Mr Kemp, be joined as a party to each of the proceedings (see Davis-Hurst v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) (2003) 198 ALR 315). I did so in reliance on unchallenged evidence which tended to establish that Mr Kemp is a descendant of the Pirripaayi people who are traditionally associated by Aboriginal law and custom with an area which includes the Saltwater land. 3 In Davis-Hurst at [14]-[15] I observed: 'It is apparently because of resource implications that Mr Kemp does not wish to advance a claim for a determination of native title in respect of Saltwater, either on his own behalf, or on behalf of himself and other living descendents of the Pirripaayi people. However, he is concerned that a determination in favour of the applicant would give formal recognition to a version of history that does not recognise the Pirripaayi people as the traditional owners of Saltwater. Mr Kemp's concern is not alleviated by the possibility that there may be extensive, or even complete, overlaps between the present claimant group and the living descendants of the Pirripaayi people. Mr Kemp is further concerned, as I understand him, that it is possible, or even likely, that the applicant is the wrong person to represent the claimant group, however described, in these proceedings. Mr Kemp believes, on the basis of information which he has obtained from Mr Marr, that under traditional Aboriginal law and custom a woman cannot claim the areas of land the subject of the applications. He also believes, apparently on the same basis, that the applicant may not accept, or perhaps be aware of, the correct dreaming story and the customary laws of the area in question. As is mentioned above, his belief is that the applicant accepts a version of the history of the claim areas that fails to give proper recognition to the connection of the Pirripaayi people to Saltwater.' 4 I noted at [19] that Mr Kemp's evidence disclosed two underlying concerns. First, a concern that Dr Davis-Hurst and the Kattang people of the Manning Valley are not the group who hold the common or group rights comprising the native title in the Saltwater land. Secondly, a concern as to the identity of the traditional laws and customs under which that native title is held. 5 In Davis-Hurst at [27] I concluded that Mr Kemp, as a descendant of the Pirripaayi people, had standing to oppose the making of the determinations of native title sought by Dr Davis-Hurst. No appeal was instituted against the order made on 4 June 2003 joining Mr Kemp as a respondent to the applications for determinations of native title in the Saltwater land. 6 On 11 August 2005 the second respondent, the Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales, applied to the Registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal pursuant to s 24CG of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') for the registration of an indigenous land use agreement ('the Agreement') in respect of the Saltwater land. Mr Kemp is not a party to the Agreement. The parties to the Agreement are the second to seventh respondents to this proceeding; that is, two Ministers of State for New South Wales, the Director-General of a New South Wales government department, the local government body for the relevant area, Dr Davis-Hurst and an entity described in the recitals to the Agreement as having been incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Association Act 1976 (Cth) for the purpose of holding native title in trust for the Saltwater People. 7 The recitals to the Agreement refer to the proceedings in this Court for determinations of native title in respect of the Saltwater land. They then record: 'D. The State on the basis of evidence provided by the Registered Native Title Claimant is prepared to recognise that the Saltwater People hold native title rights and interests in the Saltwater National Park and part of the Khappinghat Nature Reserve. E. The Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement for the purpose of: (a) recognising that the Applicant and the Saltwater People hold native title in the land and waters concerned; (b) regulating the exercise by the Saltwater People and the Saltwater Tribal Council of the native title rights and interests in the Agreement Area; (c) providing for a role for the Saltwater Tribal Council in the future management of the Saltwater National Park and part of the Khappinghat Nature Reserve. (d) providing for the withdrawal of native title determination applications NC95/4 (NG6013/98) and NC95/5 (NG6014/98); and (e) settling other matters between the Parties. F. The Greater Taree City Council, the land manager of the former Saltwater Reserve, agrees with and supports the making of this Agreement to resolve native title applications NC95/4 (NG6013/98) and NC95/5 (NG6014/98).'"
distinguished,Saffron v Societe Miniere Cafrika [1958] HCA 50 ; (1958) 100 CLR 231,"seems from the learned Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment that, in the course of oral submissions, the Appellant also advanced a case, which was not revealed by the grounds of judicial review that it had specified, that the Tribunal had erred by failing to consider whether each of the ""main businesses"" was a ""qualifying business"". The learned Federal Magistrate noted (reasons for judgment, para 51) that neither party had put before the Tribunal matters relevant to establishing a ""qualifying business"" which was a subject ""taken as said"". His Honour then opined (reasons for judgment, para 52), by reference to Saffron v Societe Miniere Cafrika [1958] HCA 50 ; (1958) 100 CLR 231 ( Saffron's Case ), ""The matter never having been put in issue before this time cannot now be raised"". On the appeal to this Court, the Appellant's submission was that the Tribunal had erred because it did not properly turn its mind to the question of whether the two businesses specified on the visa application form were ""qualifying businesses"" as defined by reg 1.03 of the Regulations. It was submitted that only by so doing could the Tribunal properly have determined that those businesses were separate ""main businesses"" for the purposes of reg 1.1(2) of the Regulations. From this it was said to follow that the rejection of United's business as a ""main business"" was erroneous because it did not violate the regulatory prohibition against the nomination of more than two ""main businesses"". In turn, the learned Federal Magistrate was said to have fallen into error by failing to hold that the identified alleged error on the part of the Tribunal was jurisdictional. The learned Federal Magistrate was also submitted erroneously to have concluded that, because the question of whether the originally specified main businesses were qualifying businesses had not been raised before the Tribunal, it could not be raised as a jurisdictional error ground before the Federal Magistrates Court. The Appellant submitted that ""the failure of the Tribunal to even turn its mind to the question of whether the main businesses nominated on the visa application form were 'qualifying businesses', was a fundamental failure to understand the task before it"". The Appellant contended that the reference by the learned Magistrate to Saffron 's Case was inapt. With respect, I agree."
cited,Australian Telecommunications Commission v Colpitts (1986) 12 FCR 395,"Australian Telecommunications Commission v Colpitts (1986) 12 FCR 395 , the Full Court found that an appeal from the decision of the Australian Telecommunications Commission was competent in the following circumstances. The decision was that the employee should be compulsorily retired for medical unfitness under s 56 of the Telecommunications Act 1975 (Cth). As required by s 56 , the Telecommunications Regulations 1975 (Cth) made provision for review of such a decision. The Review Tribunal decided that ""there was insufficient evidence to recommend any alternative to the decision"". The employee successfully challenged the validity of the decision of the Review Tribunal under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1975 (Cth), including on the basis that the relevant regulations did not make proper provision for review of the initial decision so the initial decision under s 56 was itself invalid. The judge at first instance delivered reasons for judgment to that effect, and, although no formal judgment was entered, both in his reasons for judgment and by a minute of orders containing proposed orders accompanying them made declarations as to the invalidity of the decision to retire the employee and setting aside that decision. The primary judge also concluded that, in any event, the Review Tribunal had failed to accord the employee procedural fairness so that, but for the decision about the invalidity of the relevant regulations, the matter would have had to be remitted to the Review Tribunal for reconciliation. The Full Court regarded the appeal from the order setting aside the initial decision as competent, even though there was no challenge to its being set aside for breach of procedural fairness. That is, the appeal was regarded as competent even though it was accepted by the employer as appellant that the Review Tribunal decision should be set aside because procedural fairness was not given to the employee. Toohey J (with whom Fisher J agreed) said at 402-3 that the appeal was ""from a finding implicit in the judgment"" that the initial decision was also invalid because it must have been on that basis that the matter was not remitted to the Review Tribunal for reconsideration, but that the decisions were declared to be invalid."
cited,Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1177 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 601,"In Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1177 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 601 , Barrett J approved a scheme subject to alterations which his Honour described as ""peripheral"" (at [21]). His Honour stated that the scheme in respect of which approval was sought differed in certain respects from the form of scheme that had been sent to members in accordance with the orders of the court previously made. Barrett J added (at [21]): It is clear, however, that the changes or differences are of a minor and technical kind and that their effect is to improve the smooth working of the scheme. 16 I do not purport to define or circumscribe the circumstances in which the Court may properly exercise the discretion to approve subject to alterations. The circumstances in which the Court may be asked to exercise the power vary. For example, the purpose may be to overcome minor technical errors or oversights present in the scheme as agreed to by the shareholders (see, for example, Re H Craig Pty Ltd ); to bring the scheme as agreed to by them into line with the explanatory statement that was sent to them (see, for example, Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd ); or to protect creditors (see, for example, Re Evandale Estates Ltd ). The alterations may be suggested by the plaintiff or by the Court. Apparently, however, the plaintiff would be entitled, if faced with alterations on which the Court insisted but to which it did not agree, to withdraw its application for approval."
considered,Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441,"In other words, one can look to the circumstances in which the subject entity was formed and the manner in which it is fulfilling the purposes for which it was incorporated, but there remains the issue of whether one can examine the subjective motives and intentions of the promoters of the subject entity and its directors for the purpose of ascertaining if the statutory exemption from income tax operates. In Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club 23 FCR at 98, Lockhart J referred to this issue by reference to the decision of the High Court in Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 where the ultimate issue was whether the taxpayer was a co-operative company within the meaning of s 117 of the ITAA 1936. One of the elements of the statutory definition was that the company 'is established for the purpose of carrying on any business having as its primary object or objects one or more of the following ... [objects]'. 211 The diversity of opinion in Brookton had previously been commented on by Ormiston J of the Supreme Court of Victoria in SSAU Nominees Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 16 ATR 992 at 1011: 'Here it is clear that all members of the court on each occasion [Brookton and Ruffy] held the view that the primary object or objects of the appellant's business could not be determined solely, or even initially, by reference to its memorandum of association, and that evidence of its history, setting up and activities, had to be examined. In this instance Mason J (at 453), with the concurrence of Wilson J, thought that the intentions, if not the motives, of the promoters could be looked at, although Aickin J strongly disagreed: at 463.'"
referred to,Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council [1999] NSWCA 6 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 78,"Section 75(1) obliges the Minister to decide whether an action is a controlled action and, if it is, which provisions of Part 3 are the controlling provisions. The applicant rightly points out that the language of s 75 requires the Minister to recognise his jurisdiction and that it does not follow that the Minister is to determine the issue subjectively. It is relevant that s 75 contains no reference to the Minister's mental state by the use of words such as ""opinion"", ""belief"" or ""satisfaction"" which often signify that the decision is not a jurisdictional fact. While the presence of such terms would almost invariably indicate that the determination of fact is not jurisdictional (see for instance, Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council [1999] NSWCA 6 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 78 at 90-91), their absence is not decisive; see Timbarra at 64.

The cases repeatedly say that whether a compilation has sufficient originality to attract copyright protection depends on the degree of skill, judgment or labour which has been involved in producing it. See Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273; [1964] 1 All ER 465; Football League Ltd v Littlewoods Pools Ltd [1959] Ch 637 at 650-651; Blackie &amp; Sons Ltd v Lothian Book Publishing Co Pty Ltd [1921] HCA 27 ; (1921) 29 CLR 396 at 398-399; Real Estate Institute of New South Wales v Wood (1923) 23 SR (NSW) 349 at 352. So far as compilations that consist entirely of existing material, that is, material not created by the compiler, are concerned, Ladbroke (Football) Ltd is authority that originality may be found, and a claim of copyright may therefore subsist, by virtue of selection alone. See at 277-278; 469-470, per Lord Reid, at 286-287; 476-477 per Lord Hodson, at 289-290; 478-479 per Lord Devlin and at 292, 293; 480, 481 per Lord Pearce. In Collis v Cater, Stoffell &amp; Fortt Ltd (1898) 78 LT 613, a decision that has ""never been doubted"" ( Ladbroke (Football) Ltd at 290; 479) copyright was held to exist in a chemist's catalogue ""although it contained `nothing whatever but a simple list' of drugs, etc with names and prices which the plaintiff kept in stock or could obtain to order"": Ladbroke (Football) Ltd at 278; 470. That copyright can exist in such a mundane compilation of information readily available to all shows why the skill, judgment and labour in selecting what to include in a trade catalogue will be as relevant as the often very limited skill, judgment and labour involved in putting that selection into written form, in determining whether the compilation has sufficient ""originality"" to attract copyright. In considering whether a compilation that wholly consists of or that includes existing material is itself an original work, the question is whether the compilation, looked at as an entity, is original: it is not proper to dissect the work into its parts, and by determining that the individual parts lack originality, to deny originality to the whole work. This issue is dealt with fully in Ladbroke (Football) Ltd . The reason is that by s 32 of the Act, ""copyright is a statutory right which ... would appear to subsist, if at all, in the literary or other work as one entity"", per Lord Hodson at 285; 475. See also Ladbroke (Football) Ltd at 276-277, 290 and 291; 468-469 and 478-479. Copyright in a work will be infringed by the unauthorised reproduction of a substantial part of the work: see ss 36(1) and 14 (1) of the Act. In determining whether that has occurred, it is sometimes said that the question is whether the part taken could by itself be the subject of copyright. But as Lord Reid said at 277; 469, when both the questions whether copyright subsists in a work and, if so, whether it has been infringed are in issue: "" ... that is only a shortcut, and the more correct approach is first to determine whether the plaintiffs' work as a whole is `original' and protected by copyright, and then to inquire whether the part taken by the defendant is substantial."" Later in that same case, Drummond J observed (at 490): Ladbroke (Football) Ltd, Reddwood Music and Eisinger proceed on the basis that a composite work made up of pirated material and original material produced by the compiler can itself be an original work possessing copyright, even though it may also infringe the copyright in the pirated material included in it. In my opinion, a work can be an original work in which copyright will subsist, even though it is itself an infringement of the copyright in an earlier work because it is, in part, a copy of a substantial part of that copyright work. This will be the position provided the later work includes qualitatively significant changes to the copies material."
discussed,"Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469","However both Mann v Carnell and Benecke involved circumstances where the alleged waiver resulted from a voluntary act by the holder of the privilege, albeit an act which was not intended to waive privilege. The present case involves circumstances where documents were provided under compulsion of law. Several authorities have indicated that the considerations in such cases are likely to be different: see Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469 at 473; Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364 at 368-9; Goldberg and Anor v Ng and Ors (1995) 132 ALR 57 at 68. 23 Saunders concerned a claim for privilege in respect of documents seized by the AFP as part of an ongoing investigation into the taxation affairs of the applicant. It had been submitted by the AFP in that case that because the applicant failed to claim privilege at the time of the execution of the warrant, he had impliedly waived privilege over the seized documents. In that case, the AFP relied on observations of Mason J in Baker v Campbell at 80 to the effect that the authorities seemed to suggest that privilege was lost as soon as a document passed into the hands of another who may tender it in evidence. French J in Saunders said of these observations at 473: 'With respect, these observations of the majority in Baker v Campbell fall a long way short of the suggestion that the seizure under warrant of a document the subject of legal professional privilege which has not been waived causes that privilege to be lost. The fact that the seizure may have occurred in circumstances in which the officer executing the warrant was unaware of the subsistence of legal professional privilege in the relevant document does not, in my opinion, lead to the conclusion that the privilege is lost.' 24 In Saunders , the applicant claimed to have indicated at the time of the execution of the warrant that he reserved his rights to challenge the lawfulness of the seizure. However in Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364, Mullins J held that the right to claim legal professional privilege over documents seized pursuant to a search warrant was not lost because a claim was not made at the time of seizure. Mullins J noted two relevant factors: firstly, that the respondent had been wrongfully informed that he could not contact the solicitors who were acting for him; and secondly, that the claim for privilege was made at the first available opportunity after having spoken with the solicitor acting for him."
followed,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27,"The appellant submits that the above conclusion is partly derived from information contained in the statement accompanying the appellant's application for a protection visa relating to the political activities of the appellant's family. The appellant's application for a protection visa was not provided to the Tribunal by the applicant and accordingly, s 424A(1) applied to that statement: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27 . 14 The respondent submits that the reasons for decision suggest that the appellant provided this information to the Tribunal. The respondent points in particular to the Tribunal's comments that: 'At the hearing before me the Applicant repeated that all his family had been involved in the PPP.' 15 The respondent also refers to the following paragraph: 'The Applicant said that as a member of the students' union and the PPP he had been engaged in welfare work, helping poor people and poor students with books and money. He said that he had campaigned for the PPP in the general election which the PPP had won (in 1993, although the Applicant could not remember the year) and in the general election in 1997 which the PPP lost to the PML. He said that his local MNA had been from the PPP between 1993 and 1996 but that at the election in 1997 the PML candidate had been elected. The Applicant said that he himself had stood in the election for local bodies in the late 19990s, which he said had been held on a non-party basis. He said, however, that he had not been elected because the PML was in power.'"

That conclusion materially affected its reasoning process about her credibility generally so as to lead to the dismissal of her claims. As Mason CJ held in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 355-356 at common law '...the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law.

In the present Application , that for which there has been no explanation, or no satisfactory explanation, is such delay as occurred after 6 June 2008. A two-month delay after that date is largely unexplained; and following a friend to Queensland and thereby occasioning a further two-month delay falls well short of "" special reason "".

referred to,Ron Kingham Real Estate Pty Ltd v Edgar [1999] 2 Qd R 439,"APM then submitted, in reliance upon the principles enunciated in Ron Kingham Real Estate Pty Ltd v Edgar [1999] 2 Qd R 439 at 443 per McPherson JA, that there would be no benefit to the creditors in the trustee company being wound up, and it was trite law that a creditor can claim to be subrogated to the right of indemnity of the trustee company and directly enforce the debt against the trust assets or even the beneficiaries personally. 35 The way in which these submissions were put seemed to relate both to the question of solvency and the discretion to be exercised by the Court as to whether to order a winding up, assuming I was not satisfied as to solvency. As a matter of procedure, APM moved the Court for its removal as trustee, the appointment of a receiver, and that a winding up not be ordered by the Court. 38 As to APM's reliance on Ron Kingham Real Estate 2 Qd R 439, in that case the question of whether the trustee had properly incurred liabilities was not a matter that was or could be in contention. The defendants could not, having authorised the action of the trustee, have complained of a breach of trust. 39 Putting aside the correctness of the decision in Ron Kingham Real Estate 2 Qd R 439 in allowing the trustee's creditor to sue trust beneficiaries directly to enforce the trustee's right of indemnity against the beneficiaries, I do not consider it appropriate where there is an issue or potential issue as to whether the right of indemnity is available in the circumstances of this case to conclude that the creditors should be left to pursue such claims individually. In any event, there is no evidence that there will be sufficient assets to pay the creditors after the secured creditors have been paid. I do not consider that APM's contentions relating to the right of indemnity demonstrate that APM is solvent, assuming that at law there is a right of indemnity in favour of APM, or that such right of indemnity is a factor in favour of exercising my discretion not to wind up the company. If a liquidator is appointed he will be well placed to consider and deal with the question of the right of indemnity, and pursue with priority claims over the beneficiaries. 40 I now turn to other discretionary matters raised by APM and the issue of APM continuing as a trustee and the appointment of a receiver. 41 As I have indicated above, it was contended that if I came to the conclusion that APM had not discharged the burden of proof to show it was solvent, I should not order the winding up of the company but should instead remove it as trustee and appoint a receiver over the trust assets. In support of this approach, evidence was led of a number of creditors who expressed a desire for such a course. It was argued that it would save time and costs if the appropriate person, already familiar with the company, was appointed (in this case Mr Andrew Leonard Dunner). It was further contended that with the number of actions threatened against the company a receiver would be in a better position to defend the company with the aid of the current director, that the principal director (Mr Edwards) who was responsible for the bad state of the books of accounts of the company is no longer involved with APM, and that the current director is taking steps to put the books of accounts in proper order and prepare proper financial statements. 42 In addition, it was argued that because of the operation clause 11 in the Memorandum of Agreement between APM and the developer, Rocco Antonio Calderone, dated 3 August 2005, in the event of the appointment of a liquidator, APM would not be able to rely upon its right of indemnity, as the developer would be released from its duties and obligations under the agreement, and the trust properties would vest in the hands of the beneficiaries. 43 I have come to the view that I should order the winding up of APM despite these contentions. In addition to the views I have expressed in coming to the view that APM has not discharged the burden of proof upon it and my views on the report of Mr Miller of 30 August 2007, I have concluded that APM should be wound up, and that the alternative course of action contended for by APM not be followed, for the following reasons: (i) Whilst some creditors do not want the appointment of a liquidator, this is not the universal view of the unsecured creditors, and in any event is not a decisive factor. (ii) Whilst the appointment of a receiver familiar with the company already may save some time and costs, this is not the important consideration when balanced against the important public interest of ensuring an insolvent company ceases trading even if only a presumed insolvent company. (iii) Clause 11 does not, in my view, release the developer from any past responsibilities or liabilities it may have had under the agreement all it seems to do is to release, upon the appointment of a liquidator, the developer from any further duties and obligations under the agreement from the date of the appointment. In any event, even if clause 11 does have the result as contended for by APM, including the vesting of trust property in the beneficiary, the other factors I have relied upon in these reasons would indicate that it is appropriate for the company to be wind up, the public interest being a paramount consideration where APM is unable to prove its solvency and the books of accounts are incomplete and are unsubstantiated. Upon vesting of the trust property in the beneficiaries, the company will still have a beneficial interest with priority over the beneficiaries if, as trustee, it has a right of indemnity as submitted. If the debts have been incurred in the administration of the trust, the liquidator can call upon the right of indemnity. (iv) I do not consider that there are now better prospects for the creditors as a whole (including the unsecured creditors) if the company, with or without a receiver, were allowed to continue to trade on."
referred to,Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960,It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether or to what extent the provisions of s 122 of the Evidence Act dealing with the circumstances in which privilege may be lost correspond with the common law principles; see Mann v Carnell at [23]; see also Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960 at [11] (per Campbell J).
discussed,Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 ,"The respondent submits that where notice in terms of s 41(5) was required, but not given, in respect to the alleged missed credits and payments, then the bankruptcy notice is nevertheless invalid and a nullity and is not saved by the operation of s 306 of the Act . This, he submits, is so on two separate grounds. First, the proper completion of item 5 in the Schedule to bankruptcy notices is a requirement made essential by the Act . Second, in this case, the missed payments and credits not reflected against item 5 could reasonably mislead a debtor in the position of Mr Cumins as to what is necessary to comply with the notice. The respondent, in this respect, relies upon Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 at [27] . He submits that as he had not personally made the garnishee and PAYG payments or done the ATO calculations for credits, he could have no idea of what was or was not comprised in the figure $33,456 in Item 5. 64 In Adams v Lambert, upon which the respondent relies, the bankruptcy notice was said to have been invalid because it referred to the incorrect statutory provision under which interest was claimed. It did not concern any asserted overstatement in the bankruptcy notice of the amount due. Section 41(5) had no application. Section 306 did have application but the case is of no assistance in dealing with the nature of the interrelationship between s 41(5) and s 306. 65 Alternatively, even if relevant notice under s 41(5) had been given, s 306 would have no application. I have found that there was no overstatement of the amount due under the bankruptcy notice. No other formal defect or irregularity is relied upon by the respondent. 66 In the present case, the applicant either obtains ""the benefit"" of s 41(5) because no notice was given, or alternatively, if notice was given she has rebutted the allegations of misstatements in the amount stated to be due under the bankruptcy notice. Section 306 relieves against the invalidating consequences of mistakes in the preparation of a bankruptcy notice: Adams v Lambert at [18] and [34]. There were no mistakes in the present bankruptcy notice. The section assumes the existence of a defect or irregularity. This much was conceded by counsel for the respondent. None exists here. Re Florance; Ex parte Turimetta Properties Pty Ltd [1979] FCA 58 ; (1979) 28 ALR 403 , cited by the respondent is of no assistance on this question."
cited,Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153,"Traditionally, contract formation is analysed in terms of offer and acceptance. However, as Heydon JA recognised in Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at 179, offer and acceptance are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain every case.

referred to,Bagshaw v Scott [2005] FCA 104,"In Bagshaw v Scott [2005] FCA 104 , Bennett J adopted a similar approach to that of Mansfield J in Kumar . Her Honour said, at [44], that the power to order costs against solicitors had to be exercised with care and discretion, and only in clear cases. There had to be something which amounted to a serious dereliction of duty. Simply instituting or maintaining on instructions proceedings which had no real prospect of success was not such a dereliction of duty."
cited,SZIGW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 203,"With respect to the Applicant's attempt to agitate the reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) argument in this Court, ""[i]t is well recognised that the Court may allow a ground of appeal even where that ground was not raised in the Court or Tribunal below but only where all of the relevant facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or a point of law"": SZIGW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 203 at [13] (citations omitted; emphasis added); see also Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 (stating that failure to timely raise a point may be deemed waiver of that point). In the instant case, it is at best questionable whether all of the relevant facts that would establish beyond controversy that the Applicant has been employed as a technical assistant are before the Court. In particular, the record does not disclose that the Applicant has ever drafted a patent specification or prosecuted a patent (which is not surprising, given that evidence to that effect might also suggest that the Applicant had committed an offence under s 202 of the 1990 Patents Act ): cf Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2000] NSWSC 1141 at [31] (suggesting that a ""technical assista nt"" is one who has the duty of prosecuting patent applications on behalf of clients, under the supervision of a registered patent attorney). Even accepting the Applicant's statutory declaration at face value, it states only that he has ""liaised with patent attorneys in relation to the preparation and filing of patent specifications on behalf of [his] clients."" Accordingly, the Applicant's claim under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) would ordinarily fail at the outset both because it was not clearly raised below and because not all of the facts necessary to make good the point have been established beyond controversy."
considered,Scanlan v Swan (1982) 61 FLR 468,"may, with respect, be that a degree of rigidity of thinking and misconception attended the objection decisions insofar as they affirmed the penalty uplift for obstruction. This is not the first occasion either when in practice or thereafter when I have seen an obstruction based penalty uplift imposed on assessment and maintained on objection only to be abandoned in appeal or review proceedings. Those within the Commissioner's office who conceive such a penalty uplift is applicable on assessment or who review the same on objection would be well advised to read the observations made by Helman DCJ (as his Honour then was) on the subject of what does and does not amount to obstruction in Scanlan v Swan (1982) 61 FLR 468 at 472-473 (Special leave to appeal to the High Court from this decision was granted but then revoked on the hearing of the appeal), a judgment described by Gray J in Australian Federation of Air Pilots v Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd (No 1) [1991] FCA 61 ; (1991) 28 FCR 379 at 385 as, ""helpful"". What is relevant for present purposes though is that, in these proceedings, the Commissioner readily and at an early stage conceded that Mr Russell ought to succeed in respect of this aspect of his appeals. That is hardly behaviour consistent with an absence of good faith on the Commissioner's part. The same may be said in respect of the Commissioner's ready and voluntary concession that the amount assessed in the 2002 income year was excessive and in respect of his conceding that the goods and services tax and related penalty assessments were excessive insofar as they related to the ""resident agent amount""."

applied,Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444,"The parties were not in dispute as to the principles that apply to the construction of the 981 Patent. I was referred to numerous authorities in which these principles have been clearly articulated, including Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 ( 'Welch Perrin' ) at 610; Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 ( 'Interlego' ) at 478 (see also Stephen J at first instance at 466); D&eacute;cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 at 400; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 22 IPR 1 at 18-19; Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230 at 236 [39], 238 [52] and 245-246 [91]-[94]; Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Ely Lilly &amp; Co (2005) 68 IPR 1 ( 'Pfizer' ) at 52-54 [247]-[250]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 ( 'Kirin-Amgen' ) at 452-457 [27]-[35]; PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2005) 216 ALR 41 ( 'PhotoCure' ) at 85 [172] and 85-86 [168]-[174]; Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 373 ( 'Sachtler' ) at 380-382 [39]-[42]; Clorox Australia Pty Ltd v International Consolidated Business Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 254 ( 'Clorox' ) at 260-262 [13]-[22]. 64 For present purposes, however, it is helpful to refer specifically to several principles that have particular resonance with the circumstances of this case: (1) The underlying consideration in the construction of the patent is that it is a public instrument, conferring a public monopoly, that is meant to define the monopoly in such a way that it is not capable of being misunderstood: see eg Pfizer at 52 [247]. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and to allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct that is prohibited: see eg Clorox at 261 [18]. (2) The claims define the invention which is the subject of the patent. They must be construed according to their terms by applying the ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument: see eg D&eacute;cor at 400; Clorox at 260 [15]. (3) The claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole. The rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms, or aid in resolving ambiguities in the construction of the claims: Clorox at 260 [16]; Sachtler at 381 [42]. (4) Although the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, 'the settled rule is that it is not permissible to vary or qualify the plain or unambiguous meaning of the claim by reference to the body of the specification': see Interlego per Barwick CJ and Mason J at 478. Further, 'it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification. Similarly, if a claim be clear it is not to be made obscure simply because obscurities can be found in particular sentences in other parts of the document': Welch Perrin at 610 per Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ; see also Clorox at 261 [17]. (5) A patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction. This involves construing the claims in a practical, commonsense manner, avoiding too technical or narrow a construction of the claims, and preferring a construction under which the invention will work to one where it may not work: Pfizer at 53-54, citing Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56. It also means construing the claims in light of what a reasonable person to whom the patent was addressed would have understood the language of the claim to mean: Kirin-Amgen at 453-454 [30], [32] and [34] per Lord Hoffman. (6) The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date. The words used in the specification and the claim are to be given the meaning that the skilled addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: Clorox at 261-262 [20]; D&eacute;cor at 391; PhotoCure at 85 [170]. (7) The proper construction of the specification is a matter of law for the Court to determine. However, evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words that might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: see Clorox at 262 [21]; see also Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control (2000) 49 IPR 225 ( 'Root Quality' ) at 237 [49]. 146 Ranbaxy argued that the actions that Warner-Lambert had to take after 30 May 1986 to develop and market a single enantiomeric drug showed that the practical difficulties to which it pointed were very real. In particular, Ranbaxy referred to the fact that Warner-Lambert encountered difficulties with racemic atorvastatin lactone in mid 1987; at that point it decided to resolve the racemate into its individual enantiomers; and on 1 February 1989 Warner-Lambert filed a United States patent application directed to the process it had developed for the chiral synthesis of enantiomers of atorvastatin lactone. Assuming that it is appropriate on a question of construction to have regard to these subsequent events, these matters do not affect my conclusion as to the proper construction of the 981 Patent. On the evidence before me, there was a common expectation prior to 30 May 1986 that single enantiomeric drugs could be commercially produced whether by way of resolution or chiral synthesis. The fact that there were numerous single enantiomeric drugs on the market by that stage confirmed this expectation. The possibility that difficulties may be encountered in developing an enantomeric drug for commercial sale does not have the consequence, in my view, that the 981 Patent should be read down so that it only claims racemic mixtures. It must be borne in mind that the patent is concerned with the grant of a monopoly in respect of the claimed compounds for a period of 20 years. There is no reason to doubt that there was a general expectation that means could be found to develop methods of synthesising single enantomeric drugs for commercial sale over that time frame. To my mind, it is unreasonable to suppose that the patent was intended to be confined to racemates simply because difficulties might arise in the near term in producing a single enantiomeric drug on a commercial scale. In any event, I have grave doubts that subsequent conduct of the kind to which Ranbaxy refers in this argument (as distinct from the surrounding commercial circumstances at 30 May 1986) can properly be used as an extrinsic aid to the proper construction of the 981 Patent: cf FAI Traders Insurance Co Ltd v Savoy Plaza Pty Ltd [1993] 2 VLR 437; see also Kirin-Amgen at 452 [28]."
applied,Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7,"In relation to passing off, a statement by Lord Oliver in Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7 is valuable not only for its statement of the law but for its reminder that these kinds of cases turn essentially on their own particular facts. His Lordship said: ""Although your Lordships were referred in the course of argument to a large number of reported cases, this is not a branch of the law in which reference to other cases is of any real assistance except analogically. It has been observed more than once that the questions which arise are in general questions of fact. Neither the appellants nor the respondents contend that the principles of law are in any doubt. The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general proposition - no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying get up (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff's goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a representation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff's identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial, as long as they are identified with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff's. For example, if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing goods of a particular description, it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name. Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers, or, in a quia timert action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff."" 121 The findings above lead to these conclusions. Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market, yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names. They have distinct identities in the market place. Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate. Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple, or any other colour, as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury. I am not satisfied that this has occurred, or is likely to occur. 122 There will be an order that the application be dismissed. Darrell Lea foreshadowed an application for indemnity costs. The question of costs will be adjourned to a date to be fixed. Outlines of submissions are to be filed by Darrell Lea seven days and by Cadbury three days before the adjourned date.

cited,National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13,"In National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13 ( 'National Mutual' ), Gibbs J considered the meaning of the phrase 'for the purpose of producing assessable income' in s 88(1) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936 1963 (Cth) in a provision which said, 'where a taxpayer has paid any premium in respect of land, premises or machinery used for the purpose of producing assessable income and in the year of income [certain events occurred] a proportionate part of the amount of that premium ... shall be an allowable deduction'. Gibbs J at page 18 said this: The question then is whether the words ""used for the purpose of producing assessable income"" in s 88(1) and (2) on their proper construction apply to land ... only when it is solely used or chiefly used for the purpose of producing assessable income. The section itself contains no words restricting its operation in that way. If the provisions are literally construed, they apply when the land is used for the purpose of producing some assessable income even though it is used for other purposes as well. No doubt the application of the section might be excluded if the use of the land for the purpose of producing assessable income was so insubstantial as to call for the application of the principle de minimis non curat lex , but it is unnecessary to consider that situation ... [emphasis added] 47 In National Mutual , at page 22, Gibbs J said this: I conclude that the words of s 88 should be given the broad meaning which, in their ordinary and natural sense, they are capable of bearing, and should be understood as including a reference to land which has in fact been used for the purpose of producing assessable income whether or not that was the main use of the land.

cited,Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 26 FCR 316,For a disease to be compensable under the SRC Act something more than a mere temporal connection must be found; there must be a material contribution towards either the contraction of the disease or an aggravation of it: See the definition of 'disease' in s 4(1) of the SRC Act and Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 26 FCR 316. The Tribunal's finding that there had been a temporal connection only between the onset of the applicant's symptoms and his work precludes any finding that the applicant had suffered a work-related disease which was therefore compensable.

cited,Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 413 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 688,"The plaintiffs submitted that: (a) It is well established that the use of company funds to defend oppression proceedings may, in certain circumstances, constitute oppression (see Re DG Brims and Sons Pty Ltd (1995) 16 ACSR 559 at 591 592; Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 413 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 688 at 733; and Cassegrain v CTK Engineering Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 495 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 249 at [90] to [99] (pp 267 269); and Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corp Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [250] to [258]). (b) Where the issue has been raised prior to the final determination and there is a significant risk of the company's resources being expended in the defence of the interests of the majority, there is no reason why the Court would not step in at the interlocutory stage and make appropriate orders. In support of this submission, Counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon certain observations made by Brereton J in Grace v Grace (2007) 25 ACLC 141 ; [2007] NSWSC 6 at [52] and at [61] (second dot point). (c) The normal test for the grant of an interlocutory injunction applies in the circumstances of the present case; (d) The plaintiffs have established a strong case that there is a serious question to be tried; and (e) The balance of convenience favours the grant of an injunction because "" ... there is a decidedly uneven playing field ... "" in the sense that the plaintiffs are compelled to fund the litigation in circumstances where they have no assets of any significance whereas their protagonists, the Buskens, have access to company funds. 30 However, that is not the end of the matter. None of the authorities to which I have been referred involved an application for interlocutory relief founded upon the same ground as the ground relied upon by the plaintiffs in the present application. Further, some of those authorities support the proposition that, because it may be difficult to determine on an interlocutory basis which costs may be regarded as the legitimate responsibility of the corporate defendants over which the oppression suit is being fought, courts are reluctant to make a determination in advance, ie, at an interlocutory stage ( Fexuto [1998] NSWSC 413 ; 28 ACSR 688 at 733; 20 28; Re A Company (No 001126 of 1992) [1994] 2 BCLC 146 at 155 156; Grace 25 ACLC 141 ; [2007] NSWSC 6 at [49] to [52] and at [59] to [61]). This latter point may not be a very strong point in favour of the first, second, fourth and fifth defendants in the present case but is one that nonetheless needs to be weighed in the balance. It seems to me that the Court is generally reluctant to interfere at the interlocutory stage with the payment of legal fees and expenses unless there is good reason to do so."
cited,Campbell v Metway Leasing Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-630,"In relation to the applicant's allegation that the respondents intentionally caused the applicant to become a bankrupt (par 456), it is clear from the statement of claim that the applicant bitterly resents conduct in which he alleges the respondents engaged which he believes caused his bankruptcy, and indeed bitterly resents the fact of his bankruptcy. However the applicant has become a bankrupt through lawful process in the Federal Court and has throughout that process had opportunities to challenge the circumstances leading to his bankruptcy. I respectfully adopt comments of McInerney J in Campbell v Metway Leasing Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-630. In that case the appellants pleaded undue harassment or coercion by the respondents in relation to, inter alia , issuing two bankruptcy notices where there were allegedly no debts due. His Honour said at 40,916-7: 'In my opinion, however, the institution of legal proceedings which are not themselves vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of process, and therefore liable to be summarily dismissed under Part 13 rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW), cannot constitute ""undue"" harassment or coercion for the purposes of section 55 (Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW), being the NSW equivalent of section 60 Trade Practices Act ) as a plaintiff, within these bounds, has a legitimate right of recourse to the Courts for the determination of their claim or grievance.' 85 To the extent that the third respondent allegedly threatened the applicant with 'a life long vendetta' (par 461), and in relation to the applicant's allegations concerning the alleged theft of files by the third and fourth respondents (par 470), the applicant has not pleaded: a. how the third and fourth respondents, who are individuals, are liable under s 60 Trade Practices Act (assuming that it this section the applicant is relying on in relation to this allegation). b. whether the applicant claims that the corporate respondents are liable in relation to this claim. c. if s 60 is relied on, how the conduct in question is relevant to the provision of goods and services or payment for goods and services as required by the legislation. 86 Further, in relation to the alleged theft of the applicant's files claimed in par 470, I repeat my comments earlier in relation to Count 6 concerning: a. whether this conduct constitutes undue harassment in breach of s 60 and b. the fact that unlawful access of the respondents to the applicant's home and his possessions potentially gives rise to cause of action in the State courts in tort."
cited,"Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108; (2008) 249 ALR 762","to these questions and the broader framework of whether an administrative decision-maker has fallen into error of law see Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108; (2008) 249 ALR 762, per Greenwood J at [96] to [99], per French J agreeing, at [3] and Weinberg J agreeing at [41]. It follows therefore that if the Tribunal takes an irrelevant consideration into account in reaching its decision, it has engaged in an error of law and the question of whether the Tribunal has taken an irrelevant consideration into account raises a question of law. It also follows that a question of whether the Tribunal has reached a finding unsupported by any evidence, raises a question of law. A contention that inferences have been drawn from facts in circumstances where those inferences are not reasonably open, also raises a question of law. Considerations The position in relation to the resolution of the present application seems to me to be this."

cited,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609,"That has been the subject of further submissions by the first respondent. I do not accept one of those submissions. It is put that the fact of inconsistency in evidence provided to the Tribunal is not itself information which activates the obligation under s 424A of the Act. That is of course generally correct. So much was explained in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609. However, I think that principle relates to inconsistencies which emerge in the course of a hearing and does not necessarily relate to inconsistencies which the Tribunal discerns from other information available to it. In my view, the application of that principle depends upon the Court being satisfied that the information provided at the earlier hearing before the first Tribunal was generally information before the Tribunal which did not enliven s 424A at all."
applied,The Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd [1997] HCA 10 ; (1997) 187 CLR 297,"As a matter of construction, the use of the verb ""considers"" in s 24CL(3) has the effect of placing that subsection within ""that category of laws whose operation is made conditional upon the opinion or satisfaction as to certain matters of a designated authority or person, with the consequence that the merits of the matter are not examinable upon judicial review"": The Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd [1997] HCA 10 ; (1997) 187 CLR 297 , at 303. As the High Court found in that case (ibid), the word ""considers"" was used to that end in the legislation then under consideration. Later, in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 650, [127] et seq, Gummow J, who had been a member of the Full Court which delivered the unanimous joint judgement in The Australian Heritage Commission Case , comprehensively analysed this type of statutory provision and the amenability of decisions made thereunder to judicial review. In the course of that analysis, Gummow J drew attention (at 653-654, [136]) to the following remarks made by Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) in Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 , at 118-119 in relation to the judicial review of a ""satisfaction"" based decision: In all such cases the authority must act in good faith; it cannot act merely arbitrarily or capriciously. Moreover, a person affected will obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account. Even if none of these things can be established, the courts will interfere if the decision reached by the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly have arrived at it. However, where the matter of which the authority is required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be very difficult to show that it has erred in one of these ways, or that its decision could not reasonably have been reached. After citing this passage, Gummow J added (at 654, [137]): 137. This passage is consistent with the proposition that, where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ, it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at the decision in question. It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies, or, with other matters, goes to establish or to deny, that the necessary criterion has been met was all one way."
cited,Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592,"Paragraph (k) assumes that ownership is to be tested as at the date of filing an application for registration. YD relied on the dictum of Kitto J in Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592 at 595 that in ""applications for registration, the rights of the parties are to be determined as at the date of the application"". In Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 ; [2003] AIPC 91-839 at [37] - [38] , the Full Court said: The basis of any claim to ownership of a trade mark so far unused is to be found in the combined effect of authorship of the mark, the intention to use it upon or in connection with goods or services and applying for registration of the mark - Shell Company of Australia Ltd v Rohm and Haas Company &amp; Anor [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 at 627 .... Authorship in that sense involves the origination or first adoption of the word as and for a trade mark - Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Company [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 399. Thus, if the Trade Mark had not been used prior to the Priority Date in connection with the goods and services specified in the Application, Ms Lomas should be treated as the owner of the Trade Mark. On the other hand, if Winton is able to establish that, as at the Priority Date, it was the owner of the Trade Mark and not Ms Lomas, the opposition based on s 58 would succeed. 134 I think I should follow Crazy Ron's . There the date at which the validity of registration was to be tested was squarely raised. The decision on this issue was based on the definition of ""applicant"" in s 6. The relevant date was not an issue in Lomas . The Full Court did not refer to the definition of ""applicant"". The question there was who was the owner at the priority date. The parties were not in dispute as to the time at which to test ownership. Nor was the proper date at which the rights of the parties were to be determined an issue in Southern Cross . Further, the Trade Marks Act 1905 contained no definition of ""applicant"". Kitto J's five propositions were, as his Honour said, taken from Romer J's judgment in In re Jellinek's Application (1946) 63 RPC 59 at 78. That was a decision under the Trade Marks Act 1938 (1 &amp; 2 Geo 6 c 22), which contained no definition of ""applicant""."
cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Maltsin (2005) 88 ALD 304,"That said, however, the Tribunal must, when requested so to do by an applicant, give genuine consideration to the request. That requires consideration of the evidence that is sought to be led, the person by whom the evidence is to be given, the current state of the evidence before the Tribunal and the potential impact that the evidence, if accepted, might have on the applicant's claims. Otherwise, the Tribunal would not be providing the applicant with a fair hearing which would demonstrate jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Maltsin (2005) 88 ALD 304. In this case, the Tribunal was not aware that it had Rashed Khan Menon's telephone number and address. It cannot be criticised for not knowing that. The Tribunal was entitled to reason, having regard to the appellant's own evidence and the evidence of his three witnesses, that any further evidence would be of no assistance and not be capable of corroborating the unsatisfactory evidence already received: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 per McHugh and Gummow JJ at [49]; WADU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1252 at [45] ."

In that letter Ms Holani made no reference to access or living arrangements except to say that her mother has raised her, as has her father (RBRD 1 p 244) &#8226; a submission from Leonard Holani, a child of the applicant over 18 years of age, dated 6 October 2006 wherein Mr Holani stated that his five brothers and sisters all relied on the applicant either financially or emotionally, and that ""I believe my youngest brothers and sisters would be affected the most as they are still quite young and need a father figure in their lives as does any child"" (RBRD 1 p 245) &#8226; a submission from James Gordon Wallace dated 1 October 2006 (RBRD 1 pp 248-249) wherein Mr Wallace states that, inter alia , the applicant is a doting and loving father of six children, and that, with respect to the children under 18 years, ""Larni Holani, his eldest daughter, presently attends the Carina San Sisto Girls College and again Clyde Holani has paid for her schooling.

The four younger children show great affection for their father. I think I recall I said in my last letter it would be heartbreaking to separate the children from their father, particularly as their biological mother shows little affection toward them. Clyde's partner Vicky Wallace has been living with him since 2000. She is very good with the young children and it is obvious that they are also very affectionate toward her."""

followed,Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 543,"Some basic propositions about s 21 should be borne in mind before approaching the detail of the issue. (1) ""Knows"" and ""known"" are strong words. They mean considerably more than ""believes"" or ""suspects"" or even ""strongly suspects"" (per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (in liq) [2003] HCA 25 ; (2003) 214 CLR 514 at 531; see also Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard (1999) 47 NSWLR 735; (2000) 11 ANZ Ins Cas 61-458 per Davies A-JA at 75259). (2) The ""matter"" must be known to the insured. (3) On one alternative, the ""matter"" must also be known to be relevant to the decision of the particular insurer whether to accept risk, and, if so, on what terms in this case, on the basis put forward, by Macquarie Underwriting. As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [70] : ""Under the Act, attention is shifted from the prudent insurer to the particular insurer."" Although their Honours were in dissent in the result, this statement is obviously correct. (See also Twenty-First Maylux Pty Ltd v Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Aust) Ltd [1990] VR 919 ; (1989) 92 ALR 661.) (4) Relevance to the acceptance of the risk in the sense of the particular insurance hazard is required (McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [32] ). (5) In the other alternative, it must be found that a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know that the matter was relevant to the decision of the particular insurer. There is some debate about the meaning of the words ""the circumstances"". Although they plainly mean the circumstances of the particular case, the debate is said to be between subjective and extrinsic circumstances (see the discussion in Mann P, Annotated Insurance Contracts Act (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 2003), para 21.10.8). (6) There is a debate as to whether an insured can ""know"" a matter by its agent cf McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ at [30] with Gummow and Hayne JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [82] [89]. Pending further clarification by the High Court, the wider view should be taken following Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 543 per Powell JA at 610 611 (agreed with by Priestley JA and Clarke JA). (7) The obligation applies to renewal of a contract (s 11(9)(b)) ( Alexander Stenhouse Ltd v Austcan Investments Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 22 ; (1993) 112 ALR 353)."
cited,Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833,"Recently, a question very similar to that which arises in this case, arose before Buchanan J in an application for civil penalties by an Australian Building and Construction Commission inspector: Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833. As part of an investigation into alleged breaches of the WR Act statements were taken from a number of people. They were signed and witnessed. The Commission subsequently sought to rely upon affidavits sworn or affirmed by people from whom the statements were taken in which they deposed to the truth and accuracy of the statements and exhibited them to the affidavits. Eight statements adopted in that fashion were relied upon at the hearing before Buchanan J as part of evidence-in-chief in the applicant's case. 20 Buchanan J ruled that the witness statements were made admissible by their adoption in the affidavits. Although his ruling was made in the course of the hearing, his Honour subsequently reduced his reasons for decision to writing. 21 Buchanan J referred to s 37 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and in particular s 37(3) which contemplates the exercise by a court of power in the rules of court to allow a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidence-in-chief of its maker. A question arose whether the statements adopted by the witnesses were hearsay within the meaning of s 59 of the Evidence Act . His Honour held that if they were they would fall within an exception to the hearsay rule in s 63 and not be inadmissible for that reason. He referred to the decision of the Full Court in Platcher v Jones [2004] FCAFC 68. He did not read the observations of their Honours as turning on the requirements of s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act . I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations. His Honour rejected the objection taken to the admissibility of the statements. He also rejected a separate submission that the Court should require the evidence to be given orally in any event. He saw no reason to depart from earlier directions that the conduct of the proceedings be by affidavit. His Honour said (at [4 ]): In the circumstances, I will admit the statements in question in the sense that I will not exclude them from the evidence upon the basis which has so far been argued. However, it follows that if the statements are to be treated as part of the evidence in chief, as I think they should be, then they will be subject to objections in the ordinary way upon some other foundation if that appears to be available. Such objections will need to be dealt with as they are taken. I reject the objection so far taken in a general way to the statements in question."
applied,R v Propsting [2009] VSCA 45,"the criminal law it is established that a maximum penalty prescribed for an offence is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed. In Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478; [1988] HCA 14 , Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: That does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it be possible to envisage a worse case; ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness. In R v Propsting [2009] VSCA 45 , Vincent JA said at [15]: There is a stage at which conduct becomes so egregious that it must be regarded as being of a kind attracting the imposition of a very substantial, if not the maximum, penalty for the commission of the offence involved regardless of whether a more serious example could be imagined."

The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 92 The taxpayer applicants drew further attention, in the present context of discussion, to the following opinions of Lord Hobhouse in Arthur S Hall &amp; Co v Simons [2000] UKHL 38 ; [2002] 1 AC 615 at 743 as to the operation of the principle of abuse of process: 'The ""collateral attack"" point is a species (or ""sub-set "") of abuse of process. There is no general rule preventing a party inviting a court to arrive at a decision inconsistent with that arrived at in another case. The law of estoppel per rem judicatam (and issue estoppel ) define when a party is entitled to do this. Generally there must be an identification of the parties in the instant case with those in the previous case and there are exceptions. So far as questions of law are concerned, absent a decision specifically binding upon the relevant litigant, the doctrine of precedent governs when an earlier legal decision may be challenged in a later case. A party is not in general bound by a previous decision unless he has been a party or privy to it or has been expressly or implicitly covered by some order for the marshalling of litigation ( Ashmore v British Coal Corpn [1990] 2 QB 338 ). This overlaps with the concept of vexation where the same person is faced with successive actions making the same allegations which have already been fully investigated in a previous case in which the later claimant had an opportunity to take part. This reasoning does not apply to an action against a lawyer alleging that he has mishandled a previous case.' I have earlier made reference to dictum of Lord Hoffman appearing in Arthur S Hall, in the context of my earlier citation from Spalla of the public policy element which assists to define the scope of the doctrine of abuse of process, and I have of course already discussed the judicial notion of ' privy '. The taxpayer applicants contended that it could not be said that they had an ' opportunity to take part ' in what was described by them as '... a contest over the liability to tax in respect of other years and in respect of other taxpayers'. That contention was contextually related to the further proposition of the taxpayer applicants that '... the Commissioner's submission that the present taxpayers and Spassked are controlled by the same entity, is in the present circumstances, irrelevant to the question of abuse of process'. I have difficulty in understanding why that should be so. Control by the same corporate entity, for instance the control of a holding company over its wholly owned subsidiaries, may surely be a factor of potential relevance to the resolution of an issue as to abuse of process which focuses upon the conduct of the controlled entity and a relevantly related company, especially in circumstances of entire (ie wholly owned) shareholding control. As exemplified in passages I have earlier extracted from the judgments in Spassked at first instance and appeal, evidence was led as to the operations, activities and decision making of and in relation to IEL wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries comprising the taxpayer applicants in particular, in relation to periods of time both prior and subsequent to the 1992 fiscal years. A similar observation is seemingly apposite to the purported reliance by the taxpayer applicants upon the following dictum of Heydon JA (as he then was and with whom Spigelman CJ and Mason P agreed), in R v O'Halloran [2000] NSWCCA 528 ; (2000) 36 ACSR 315 at 342-344, in the course of which his Honour observed that '[t]he law prevents Mrs Fenwick relitigating in civil proceedings issues decided in earlier civil proceedings; it does not necessarily prevent a non-party, namely the director, litigating issues for the first time in criminal proceedings' . What of course is here relevantly involved are civil proceedings alone."
cited,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Gas Light Co (1983) 74 FLR 13 ,"The Commissioner submitted that it is a fundamental defect in BARM's argument that it impermissibly seeks to make derivation of the income amount (the debt/payment in respect of management services) dependent upon the capacity to recover the capital asset arising from investment of the income (the debt owing by PGF). Apart from the illogicality of the contended dependence, it is relevant to note that even if there had been an impediment to recovery of the debt on income account, that would not lead to the result that it would not have been derived as income. In Barratt at 232, Gummow J (Northrop and Drummond JJ agreeing) drew attention to the distinction between: (a) the situation where a debt has not come into existence, with the result that income will not have been derived (an example of which was Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Gas Light Co (1983) 74 FLR 13); and (b) the situation where a debt has come into existence, but there is an impediment to recovery. Accordingly, statutory prohibitions against recovery of fees for medical services pursuant to s 35(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act 1938 (NSW) were only impediments to enforcement that did not lead to the result that taxpayers assessable on an accruals basis had not derived the fees as income."
followed,Leghaei v Director-General of Security [2007] FCAFC 56,"carefully studied the redacted parts of the respondent's affidavit I have concluded that they should not be made available to the applicants' legal advisers, even on the giving of appropriate undertakings. There are many cases that establish that courts should attach very considerable weight to the view of what national security requires as is expressed by the responsible officer. See for example Leghaei v Director-General of Security [2007] FCAFC 56 at [56] - [58] , [62]. Although usually expressed in connection with the inspection of protected documents themselves, those observations apply also to an affidavit, such as that sworn in this case, which supplies the reasons for the claim to privilege. In the open part of his affidavit the respondent says that the disclosure of the redacted portions of his affidavit would be likely to prejudice national security. In the balance of the affidavit, in particular the redacted parts, he explains the basis for his opinion. Having read those parts, I am satisfied that the opinion is soundly based. Accordingly, the respondent may rely on his affidavit in support of his public interest claim without providing to the applicants' legal representatives the redacted parts thereof. The next question is whether the respondent's public interest immunity claims should be upheld. In Church of Scientology v Woodward [1982] HCA 78 ; (1980) 154 CLR 25 at 76 Brennan J said: Discovery would not be given against the Director-General [of Security] save in a most exceptional case. The secrecy of the work of an intelligence organization which is to counter espionage, sabotage, etc. is essential to national security, and the public interest in national security will seldom yield to the public interest in the administration of civil justice ... ... the veil of secrecy is not absolutely impenetrable ... But the veil is not penetrated merely by a plaintiff's deposition that he is not a security risk. That, after all, may be the very matter which is under investigation. See also Leghaei v Director-General of Security [2007] FCAFC at [52] and R v Khazaal [2006] NSWSC at [31]-[32]."
referred to,Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550,"The High Court said that the common law principles of procedural fairness required the Tribunal to advise the applicants of the substance of the allegations in the letter. The Tribunal was not required to give the applicants a copy of the letter or provide any information which would have identified the author of the letter (at [7]). The Court referred to certain statutory provisions, but said that in the circumstances the case was to be decided by reference to the common law principles of procedural fairness. The Court referred to the reasons for judgment of Brennan J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 628-629. The Court concluded that the Tribunal had an obligation to draw the applicants' attention to the information in the letter. The Court then said (at 98 [22]-[23]): ""The fact that the author of the letter asked the Department to keep it secret did not mean that equitable principles about confidential information were to be engaged in deciding what course the Tribunal took. Rather, the nature and extent of the Tribunal's obligation to disclose the information were regulated by the Act and the obligation to accord the appellant procedural fairness. In this case, the particular content of the obligation to accord procedural fairness was to be identified having regard not only to the particular provisions of the Act that regulated the Tribunal's work but also to the scope and objects of the Act as a whole. In that latter regard, it is necessary to keep two propositions at the forefront of consideration. First, the Act required that those entitled to a particular visa be granted the visa they sought, and that those not entitled be refused. Secondly, the Act committed the decision to grant or refuse a visa to the Executive government and the Tribunal was likewise exercising executive power, not judicial power."" 57 The Court said that there was a public interest in the Executive government, when making its decision, not being denied information that has been or may later be supplied by an informer (at 98 [24]). That public interest and the rules of procedural fairness could be accommodated by a requirement that the applicant be advised of substance of the allegations and asking him to respond to those allegations (at 100 [29]). The Court concluded that the Tribunal had not complied with the rules of procedural fairness. 58 The decision in VEAL suggests that in this case the Minister was obliged to disclose to the applicant the substance of the information in the Parole Board reports. The Minister sought to meet the difficulty caused by the fact that he had not done so by submitting that the obligation did not arise in this case because the information in the Parole Board reports was either information from the applicant, or was information which was not adverse to the applicant or was information he already had from other sources. The other sources identified by the applicant were a report of Mr Sowerbutts dated 29 August 2006 and Ms Beevor's report. A decision-maker's obligation of disclosure where the common law rules of procedural fairness apply has been discussed in a number of cases. I need go no further than refer to the two well-known decisions of Kioa v West (supra) at 628-629 per Brennan J; Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 588-592. 59 In this case the Minister presented a schedule of the information in the Parole Board reports and of where he said it either came from the applicant, or was not adverse or was known to the applicant from other sources. The Minister did not submit that there was not information in the Parole Board reports which was ""credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made"" ( Kioa v West (supra) at 629 per Brennan J). There are obvious difficulties with the Minister's submission. For example, unless the same words are used, it will sometimes be difficult to determine if the information provided by the applicant or said to have been available from another source is actually the same information which the applicant claims ought to have been disclosed. 60 In this case, there clearly was information in the Parole Board reports which was adverse and was not provided by the applicant or to him from other sources. That information related to concerns about where the applicant proposed to live in relation to his victim. The substance of that information should have been disclosed to the applicant. The applicant now has the Parole Board reports and it is not necessary for me to go further and express a conclusion in relation to each piece of information in the Parole Board reports. 61 The applicant has established a breach of the rules of procedural fairness. 62 The applicant submitted that by reason of the decision-maker's conduct he was denied the opportunity to put his case and has been denied procedural fairness. Of course, the Minister and the officers of his Department did not prevent the applicant from putting forward whatever information he considered appropriate; in fact, he was encouraged by an officer of the Minister's Department to put his best foot forward. However, his case is that by reason of a representation made to him he did not put forward all the information he would otherwise put forward. 63 Two decisions of the High Court have dealt with the question of whether there had been a breach of the rules of procedural fairness in circumstances where an applicant, as a result of something said by the decision-maker, did not present to the decision-maker all of the evidence and submissions he would otherwise have presented."
cited,R v Hannes [2000] NSWCCA 503 ; (2000) 158 FLR 359,"It seems to me that the case must fail unless I find that Mr Manchee made the supposition in precisely those terms. This is because the authorities establish the central importance of the identified information to the statutory scheme: see R v Hannes [2000] NSWCCA 503 ; (2000) 158 FLR 359 at [26] [27] per Spigelman CJ. Reference has also been made to the level of precision required in formulating the charge: see Hannes v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373 ; 60 ACSR 1 at [377] , [415] per Barr and Hall JJ. 558 The position seems to me to be analogous to that which was referred to by Spigelman CJ in R v Hannes at [254] [257]. Here the supposition that Citigroup was acting for Toll in relation to the Patrick takeover was one essential part of the ""information"" on which the claim was based. As Spigelman CJ said at [257], if it was generally available, one would expect to find it in the contemporaneous reports. Yet no such evidence was available, even in the form of speculation or rumour. 559 Mr Mews and Mr Sisson agreed that when one is considering whether information in the form of a deduction is generally available, the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle is apt. But as Mr Sisson said, if all pieces other than those from a small area are removed, as Mr Mews appears to have done, it is relatively easy to fit the remaining pieces together to reach the desired conclusion. 560 Counsel for Citigroup pointed to the evidence of Mr Harvey to support a finding that the information was generally available. Mr Harvey was called by ASIC to give evidence on its behalf."

In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law.

followed,SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315,"response the respondent submitted in summary: The Tribunal did consider the claim of the appellants concerning their membership of a particular social group, namely wealthy middle class businessmen, but it was in the context of the primary submission of the appellants before the Tribunal which was that the male appellant was being persecuted due to his perceived association and support for various Tamil groups. The issue whether a particular social group needs to be considered if there has been no persecution was recently considered by Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315. The Tribunal found, as a finding of fact, a lack of credibility in the appellants' account of events which formed the basis for the claim of a well-founded fear of persecution. In short, the Tribunal did not accept that the appellants left Sri Lanka in the circumstances claimed, nor that they had been targeted by the Sri Lankan security forces, the army, the paramilitary, the Karuna nor anyone else. No jurisdictional error or error in the decision of the Federal Magistrate was apparent in this ground of appeal. Consideration Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention provides that a ""refugee"" is a person who: owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. In applying Art 1A(2) of the Convention and the concept of ""persecution"" in the context of the Migration Act , s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) relevantly provides: (1) For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person, Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol does not apply in relation to persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned in that Article unless: (a) that reason is the essential and significant reason, or those reasons are the essential and significant reasons, for the persecution; and (b) the persecution involves serious harm to the person; and (c) the persecution involves systematic and discriminatory conduct. (2) Without limiting what is serious harm for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the following are instances of serious harm for the purposes of that paragraph: (a) a threat to the person's life or liberty; (b) significant physical harassment of the person; (c) significant physical ill treatment of the person; (d) significant economic hardship that threatens the person's capacity to subsist; (e) denial of access to basic services, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist; (f) denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist. I accept Ms McWilliam's submission that this case is not out of the ordinary, so that as a general proposition the Tribunal must consider the appellants' case by reference to the particular social group articulated by them (cf Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315). However, the appellants' case is (and must be in order to satisfy the requirements of the Migration Act and the definition of ""refugee"" for the purposes of the Convention), that they had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their membership of a particular social group. As submitted by the Minister, in essence the Tribunal made a factual finding that the appellants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for any reason, because the Tribunal did not accept that the appellants had previously been the subject of abduction, assault, harassment or other forms of serious harm which complaints formed the basis of the appellants' claims of their well-founded fear of persecution before the Tribunal. If the appellants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution as contemplated by s 91R(1) of the Migration Act , as the Tribunal found, the Tribunal was entitled to affirm the decision of the Minister not to grant the appellants Protection (Class XA) visas. Ms Wheatley for the first respondent also directed my attention to recent comments of Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315 at [50] where, after referring to Dranichnikov [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 , his Honour said: Notwithstanding these principles, it is not necessarily an error for the Tribunal not to begin with (or even to deal with) the question of whether there is a particular social group ... If the serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and there is no discrimination and therefore no persecution, the claim must fail ..."
discussed,United Mexican States v Cabal (2001) 209 CLR 165,"application for leave or special leave to appeal is not an appeal. Rather, it is a proceeding in which an applicant for such leave or special leave is ""... no more than an applicant desiring to obtain the Court's leave to commence proceedings in the Court"": United Mexican States v Cabal (2001) 209 CLR 165 at 179 [30] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Gummow JJ, applying Collins v The Queen [1975] HCA 60 ; (1975) 133 CLR 120 at 122-123 per Barwick CJ, Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ. In DJL v The Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 248 [47] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: ""An application for special leave ""is not in the ordinary course of litigation"" and, until the grant of special leave, ""there are no proceedings inter partes before the Court ( Collins v The Queen [1975] HCA 60 ; (1975) 133 CLR 120 at 122). Further, the disposition of a special leave application is not the determination of an appeal ( Attorney-General (Cth) v Finch [No 2] [1984] HCA 40 ; (1984) 155 CLR 107 at 115) . The result is that the refusal of an application for special leave does not produce a final judgment of this Court which forecloses the re-opening of the matter in an appropriate and, necessarily, very special case where the interests of justice so require."""
considered,Davies Coop and Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1947] HCA 64 ; (1948) 77 CLR 299,"Lindsay drew attention furthermore to what was described as the leading authority on the meaning of the combined expression process or treatment, as appears in the context of sub-paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of 'aids to manufacture' contained in the legislative precursor to the STEC Act, being the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth), the words process or treatment appearing of course in each of pars (a), (b) and (c) of the Item 18(5) definition of manufacture-related activity. That authority is Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd (1981) 33 ALR 251, which was decided by the Supreme Court of Victoria (Gobbo J) at first instance, and which decision was upheld on appeal to a Full Court (Lush, Kaye and Brooking JJ) (1981) 37 ALR 595. At first instance, Gobbo J reviewed (at 268) dictionary meanings of processing and treatment , as follows: 'Turning first to the meaning of ""processing or treatment"", there is nothing in the context of Item 113C to suggest that the ordinary meaning of treatment found for Item 14 should not be adopted. Treatment was there taken to mean the act of subjecting to chemical or physical action so as to bring about a change in form nature or condition. I further found that in its context such treatment had to be directed to a relevant result, namely to use or marketability. As to processing this in my view should in its context in Item 113C and Reg 4 be taken to have a different and probably wider meaning than treatment.... These meanings all suggest that a change in nature form or condition is effected. I am disposed to the view that even in processing some change must result if this procedure is to be regarded as a process.' Lindsay drew attention in particular to 'subjecting to... physical action... [and] condition' , and also to 'use or marketability', appearing above, being expressions reflected explicitly or implicitly in Item 18(5)(a) to (c) within the definition of manufacture-related activity . After referring to Davies Coop and Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1947] HCA 64 ; (1948) 77 CLR 299, Gobbo J observed at 269 in Hamersley Iron that authority 'supports a meaning of processing that does not require that there be a change producing a commercially distinct article...', and his Honour referred to recent English authority which had 'adopted the view... that alteration of the material was not necessary to involve subjecting it to a process'. That submission was soundly conceived. 57 The Commissioner submitted however that the reasons for decision in Hamersley Iron at first instance and on appeal did not support Lindsay's case, upon the basis that '[r]efrigeration is not a chemical change, and it is doubtful whether it would be regarded as a physical action on the goods of the sort contemplated by the definition of a manufacture-related activity within subItem 5(5)'. The difficulty for the Commissioner is that even if a chemical change is not effected by refrigeration, refrigeration must at least involve physical action. Lindsay pointed out that in Hamersley Iron, '[t]he stacker and reclaimer were machines which physically stacked, and then physically blended the iron ore to ensure homogeneity', which the Commissioner appeared to accept was sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that a process or treatment was involved. However the Commissioner contended further that 'the mere cooling of goods during transport is qualitatively different from the process under consideration in Davies ', because there the winding of the yarn onto the cones and tubes was described as 'part of the process of bringing the ultimate product, namely the piece goods, into a form or condition in which they could be marketed' . The difficulty for the Commissioner flowing from any comparison of the factual circumstances in Hamersley Iron , and also in Davies , is that whilst the physical outcome of the process or treatment might be described in each case as more significant in terms of process and extent of change, the STEC notion of applying a process or treatment of goods appearing in the Item 18(5) definition of manufacture-related activity would clearly enough accommodate situations of varying degree, depending upon the nature and extent of the process or treatment the subject of application. I have not found the Commissioner's endeavours to distinguish the circumstances in Hamersley Iron (or Davies for that matter) from the present to be persuasive."
followed,"Re Cao, ex parte Dixon v Cao [1994] FCA 536","Davies' judgment in Re Cao, ex parte Dixon v Cao [1994] FCA 536 provides an interesting analysis of the case law dealing with the inclusion of contingent liabilities in the assessment of insolvency for the purposes of s 120 of the Act. His Honour relied on this extract by Cotton LJ in Re Ridler; Ridler v Ridler (1882) 22 Ch.D. 74 at 82: Then as to the point that the settler was not indebted, but only subject to a liability which might never become a debt. A man is not at liberty to take a sanguine view, but is bound to act upon a reasonable view of what is likely to happen. After discussing what his Honour called a ""clear line of authorities"", his Honour concluded that, ""[i]n a determination of the issue whether the settler can pay 'all his debts', it is necessary to take account of contingent liabilities and, if necessary, to make a valuation"" (at 6 7). Justice Einfeld in Re Finney; Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Finney (1996) 35 ATR 259 endorsed the decision in Re Cao and also relied on the decisions in Re Saebar and Re Hyams in holding that contingent and prospective liabilities are relevant debts for the exercise of determining solvency pursuant to s 120 of the Act. At 270, Einfeld J said, ""[i]t is clear law that a prospective liability for a debt should only be disregarded if it is purely speculative and without any real likelihood of being imposed""."
referred to,Comcare v Mooi (1996) 69 FCR 439,"Finally, although there are related conditions or effects under the SRC Act (eg, vertigo), loss of balance and stress are not of themselves conditions compensable under the approved guide prepared under s 28 of the SRC Act (see also Comcare v Mooi (1996) 69 FCR 439). 39 In my opinion, the proposed appeal is futile and doomed to fail and, in those circumstances, the application for an extension of time within which to appeal should be dismissed. 40 The application for an extension of time within which to appeal is dismissed.

distinguished,Tanari v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2005] AATA 419,"However, s306AA is not concerned with a stay of a decision refusing an application for registration which was deemed continuing by force of s 300(1) and (4). Rather, s 306AA deals with orders staying a decision under s 303 to cancel or suspend the registration of an agent who has already been registered for the current year; that is, prior to the cancellation or suspension. This was illustrated in Tanari v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2005] AATA 419 ("" Tanari ""). 58 Section 300 lays down a different regime for deemed registration. Quite plainly, a migration agent whose application for registration in the current year is granted, is no longer deemed registered; s/he is actually registered. But the registration is treated as having taken effect at the end of the expiry date; ie from the commencement of the current year; see s 300(6). 59 Section 300(4)(b) and (c) therefore deal with the situation where the MARA decides, during the period of deemed continuation of registration (but before the grant of any application for registration), to suspend or cancel the agent's registration. The relevant regime is explained by reference to s 300(2) and (3) when read with s 300(4)."

There is no suggestion, nor could there be, that there was any fiduciary relationship between the second respondents and the applicant. The second respondents are said to be liable to the applicant because they knowingly participated in the first respondent's breach of fiduciary duty. A person who knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty is liable to account to the person to whom the fiduciary duty was owed where that person obtains a benefit by that participation: Consul Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 8 ; (1975) 132 CLR 373 at 397. 54 It was not put that the second respondents could not be liable without actual knowledge of the first respondent's breach of fiduciary duty. It was accepted that a plea that the second respondents knowingly participated in a breach by the first respondent of his duty of confidence with the kind of knowledge pleaded in par 28 of the PFASC could be allowed to stand. 55 In Consul Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd , Gibbs J (at 398) and Stephen J (at 412) with whom Barwick CJ agreed expressed different views as to the knowledge required to establish liability in circumstances of this kind. The English Courts have expressed different views: Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan Kok Ming [1995] UKPC 4 ; [1995] 2 AC 378; Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12 ; [2002] 2 AC 164.

Because of the uncertainty in the law in Australia on this topic, it would be difficult to conclude that a plea of the kind in par 28 was untenable: Short (as Executrix of the Estate of Short (decd)) v Crawley (No 25) [2005] NSWSC 928 per White J at [43]; The Bell Group Ltd (in liq) v Westpac Banking Corporation and Ors (No 5) [2004] WASC 273.

considered,Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41,"Mr Priestley submits that I should recuse myself from hearing this matter due to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Mr Priestley points to Deane J's statement in Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 74 where his Honour noted that one of the categories of disqualification by reason of appearance of bias was ' disqualification by interest... where some direct or indirect interest in the proceedings, whether pecuniary or otherwise, gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of prejudice '. Mr Priestley submits that I have an interest in the proceedings and that I am biased as a rule making judge of the Federal Court. 10 Further, it is Mr Priestley's submission that there is no judge presently sitting on the Federal Court who can sit on his case, either because that judge was also a rule making judge with respect to the impugned rule, or because the judge has applied s 31A of the Act. Although judges have been appointed to the bench since O 20 r 5 was passed, Mr Priestley submits that these judges are also biased as they have applied s 31A of the Act in their judgments. Mr Priestley says that would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of that judge because he or she has therefore been influenced by Parliament. 11 Mr Priestley proffers two alternatives to myself or any other judge of the Court hearing his matter. He submits that the matter could be referred to the High Court under s 40 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act ') and that he could apply for a writ of prohibition and ask the High Court to issue s 78B notices in order for the High Court to examine the constitutional validity of s 31A of the Act. The other alternative Mr Priestley proffers is that Parliament appoint a new judge to the Federal Court to sit on his case."

Moreover, as deterrence (especially general deterrence) is the primary purpose lying behind the penalty regime, there inevitably will be cases where the penalty that must be imposed will be higher, perhaps even considerably higher, than the penalty that would otherwise be imposed on a particular offender if one were to have regard only to the circumstances of that offender."" These observations are pertinent in the present circumstances."
discussed,Kronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd (CMI Toyota) [2008] FCAFC 171,"IRCSA appeal was listed for hearing on 30 April 2009. On 2 April 2009, his Honour Senior Judge Jennings gave directions for the exchange of outlines of submissions in relation to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the appeal. It is unclear what the ""jurisdictional issue"" is. It may be that there is an issue as to whether an appeal lies without the making of orders (although as noted in [8] of these reasons, s 187(1) of the FW Act would appear to accommodate such an appeal). It may be that there is an issue whether that appeal is competent, having regard to the ""matter"" including the federal element and the provisions of ss 850(2) and 853 of the WR Act. As to that, see the decision in ISS Health v Duthie [2007] SAIRC 94 at [45] . See also Kronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd (CMI Toyota) [2008] FCAFC 171 ( Kronen ) at [4] and [7]. It may be that the appeal may be incompetent because it is not an appeal from the whole of the decision, but only that part of it which related to the period up to 26 March 2006. In Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171 , an Industrial Magistrate of the IRCSA had considered claims for underpayment of wages for overtime work and for underpayment of superannuation contributions. The written reasons for judgment dismissed the claim for overtime pay, but made no order reflecting the Industrial Magistrate's conclusions on the superannuation claim. The Full Court (Gray, Branson and Lander JJ) observed at [14]: The industrial magistrate made no order reflecting the conclusions he had reached on the superannuation claim. He neither dismissed the claim (which he was bound to do, if he came to the conclusion that he had no power to order the making of payments) nor made any purported declaration reflecting the conclusion to which he had come as to the meaning and effect of the provisions of the Award relating to superannuation. His Honour seems to have thought that the expression of a conclusion in his reasons for judgment was sufficient. It was not. The whole of the application by summons before the court needed to be dealt with. Plainly, because the court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the superannuation claim, that aspect of the application was required to be dismissed. There is nothing in the FW Act (which continues the existence of IRCSA established first under the Industrial Relations Act 1972 (SA) which requires its decisions to be reflected in formally drawn orders so that its orders must be drawn up and sealed. Nor is there anything in the South Australian Industrial Proceedings Rules (SA) dealing with those topics. In Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171 , the Full Court clearly accepted that the expression of an order dismissing the claim for overtime payments in the reasons for decision was sufficient to enliven the right of appeal, subject to granting leave to appeal if that were necessary: see at [15]. Clearly, that decision is different from the present circumstances. It is clear that the fact that the IRCSA does not routinely draw up formal orders after a decision (including reasons for decision) does not of itself impede the right of appeal under s 853 of the WR Act: see Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171. It therefore falls to consider whether the Industrial Magistrate, in particular by [39] of his reasons set out above, has in substance finally determined the issue as to how the parties' legal rights are to be assessed. Had the word ""determine"" been substituted for the word ""conclude"", or been used in conjunction with it, there would in my view have been no scope for debate about that. The limited liberty to apply as to the quantum reflects such an intention. In my view, the existence or otherwise of a right of appeal should not be determined by the precise word or words used, but by their substantive effect. I do not need to decide that issue because the appellant has taken upon itself to have this appeal dismissed. However, I think there is at least a reasonable basis to conclude that the Industrial Magistrate intended to, and did, finally determine the issue of principle in a binding way and that his expression at the conclusion of his reasons was intended to, and did, operate in that way. In any event, if there were any ambiguity, the Industrial Magistrate could have been asked to clarify the meaning of [39] of his reasons so as to indicate whether he intended it to be the operative judicial determination of that issue, or further, his Honour could have been asked to make such an operative judicial determination. The notice of appeal filed in the Federal Court, in the latter event, could have been allowed to stand as if that operative determination had been made at the time of the publication of the reasons and any necessary extension of time granted. No party would thereby have been prejudiced, and indeed the respondent opposed the stay motion and wanted to proceed with the appeal. I turn to consider the issue of the costs of the appeal. Section 824 of the WR Act relevantly provides: (1) A party to a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act ... must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the first-mentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause. (2) Despite subsection (1), if a court hearing a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act ... is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has, by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding, the court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs. (3) In subsections (1) and (2): costs includes all legal and professional costs and disbursements and expenses of witnesses."
referred to,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Sun [2005] FCAFC 201,"Against this, s 424B(2) and s 424B(3)(b) each provide that where no period is prescribed, the information or comments are to be given within a reasonable period. Mr Potts drew attention to the power of the RRT to extend the period to respond to an invitation contained in s 424B(4). It may well be that this power can be exercised after the initial prescribed period has expired; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Sun [2005] FCAFC 201 at [51] . 47 A difficult question of construction and reconciliation of the provisions of Div 4 of Part 7 with the privative clause in s 474 of the Act would arise if the RRT were to specify in its s 424 or 424A invitation a period of 13 days to respond, and, in the absence of a response within that period, the RRT proceeded to make a decision on the review without further action, as apparently authorised by s 424C and s 425(2)(c). 48 However, I am relieved from answering that question because of the circumstances in which the apparent breach of s 424B(2) occurred in the present case. What I have to determine is whether the breach complained of gave rise to jurisdictional error. That cannot be answered by simply posing the question of breach or no breach; it is necessary to consider whether in the particular circumstances the breach had that result. 49 I do not see how, having regard to the language of s 424B(2) or the scope of Div 4, a breach which consisted of giving an applicant more time than he or she was entitled to, could be thought to render invalid a decision given after the breach. This must be especially so where the information was provided and a hearing took place in accordance with s 425. 50 It follows that the appeal must be dismissed."

referred to,Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118,"Effectively the appellant argues that because her oral and affidavit evidence at the hearing was not found to have been what was the correct version of events, that his Honour's decision should be overturned. It was for his Honour to form a view as to which witnesses' evidence, whether in whole or in part, he accepted, having seen or heard them. His Honour gave reasons for preferring Mr Xiao's evidence to that of the appellant and I can discern no error in those reasons, nor has the appellant demonstrated any such error. I see no reason for disturbing his Honour's conclusion on credibility and reliability of the witnesses based on my review in exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the court of the record of the trial ( Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 125-129 [22] - [31] ; CSR Ltd v Della Maddalena [2006] HCA 1 ; (2006) 224 ALR 1 at 6-9 [13] - [24] per Kirby J, Gleeson CJ agreeing at 3 [1])."
followed,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at 47,"While it may be that a Tribunal must notify an appellant adequately of the issues to which its reasoning processes might be directed, it is not necessary and often would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to put to an applicant in so many words that he or she is lying, that he or she may not be accepted as a witness of truth or that he or she may be thought to be embellishing the account that he has given of certain events. Proceedings before the Tribunal are not adversarial and the Tribunal is not to adopt the position of the contradictor (see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at 47). There was no error on the part of the primary judge in his conclusions. 13 The primary judge also considered other possible jurisdictional errors on the part of the Tribunal of which there was no suggestion in the appellant's application of 12 April 2006. There is no apparent error in his Honour's observations on those matters. 14 The grounds stated in the notice of appeal are as follows: ""I do not believe that Federal Magistrates Court give me a fair judgment of my protection visa application. I am a Falun Gong member and I will be prosecuted if I go back to China. It is wrong that RRT member did not invite me to comment on any doubts she had during or after hearing. I did not have any chance to explain. RRT member also believes that my evidence seemed rehearsed without any evidence. Court should listen to the tape of RRT hearing and know what is really happening on that day."" The grounds are not helpful, but appear to be an assertion that the Federal Magistrates Court erred in failing to hold that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by not inviting the appellant to comment on doubts as to the appellant's credibility. I have already referred to that matter. 15 In any event, whether or not such an omission could constitute jurisdictional error, it does not appear to be the case here. That is to say, the reasons of the Tribunal suggest that it put in express terms to the appellant its concerns about inconsistency between his evidence and independent information. There was no error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court. 16 The appeal should be dismissed with costs. The Minister asks for costs in the fixed amount of $3,200. While there is no evidence as to the reasonableness of that fee, I am not persuaded that it is unreasonable. In the absence of the appellant it seems to me to be appropriate to accede to the Minister's request in order to avoid unnecessary further costs. I order the applicant to pay the first respondent's costs in the sum of $3,200.

His Honour said: There can be no doubt that the expression ""relating to"" is extremely wide but it is also vague and indefinite. Clearly enough it predicates the existence of some kind of relationship but it leaves unspecified the plane upon which the relationship is to be sought and identified. That being so all that a court can do is to endeavour to seek some precision in the context in which the expression is used.

followed,Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16 ; (2009) 254 ALR 606,"concept of ""reputation"" in the law of defamation comprehends all aspects of a person's standing in the community: Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16 ; (2009) 254 ALR 606 at 616 [36] per French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ. The importance of the law of defamation in balancing the right of an individual to the protection of his or her reputation and the right commonly described as freedom of speech plays a crucial role in our democratic system of government. That balance is affected at common law by the operation of the defence of qualified privilege as elaborated in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 , see at 565-576 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The test does not imply that the hypothetical referees will exercise a moral judgment about the plaintiff or applicant because of what is said about him or her. Rather, the test identifies the attributes of persons who share the standards of the general community and will apply them: Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38]. And, the moral or ethical standards held by the general community may be relevant to imputations which reflect upon a person's business or professional reputation: Chesterton 254 ALR at 618 [46]. The standard to be applied must be one common to society rather than one which reflects an attitude of a section of it: Chesterton 254 ALR at 619 [48]. French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ continued ( Chesterton 254 ALR at 618 [46]: ""In such cases the ordinary reasonable person may be expected to draw upon such community standards as may be relevant, in order to answer the question whether there has been injury to that reputation."" I am of opinion that the essential balances that will need to be struck in respect of the critical issues in this matter (other than damages) are quintessentially better determined by a jury. This assessment will best be done by the community referees to whom French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ referred in Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38], 618 [46], 619 [48] as did Brennan J in Lamb 150 CLR at 506. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the ends of justice render it expedient to direct a trial by jury of all issues in the proceedings, other than damages and any other issue which, pursuant to the Defamation Act would not be left to the jury. Thus, the question of the capacity of the matters complained of to convey any of the defamatory meanings alleged (as opposed to whether they in fact were conveyed) would remain a question of law to be decided by a judge. The part of this controversy that arises under s 53B of the Trade Practices Act should also be decided by a jury. This is because it is inextricably related to the meanings conveyed to ordinary reasonable readers by the matters complained of and whether Ms Ra has been injured in her reputation as an employer for the purposes of s 53B. However, if the jury returned a verdict in her favour on the issues of liability, the amount of compensation to be awarded pursuant to s 82 of that Act should be assessed by a judge."

A computer program is a set of instructions designed to cause a computer to perform a particular function or to produce a particular result. A program is usually developed in a number of stages. First, the sequence of operations the computer will be required to perform is commonly written out in ordinary language. Next a source program is prepared, usually in a source code which is human-readable. The source code cannot be used directly in the computer, and must first be converted into an object code, which is machine-readable. The program is executed by the computer's central processing unit.

It is not clear that this claim was pressed. In my view it is clear that the opening words of cl 24 of the terms and conditions upon which Mr Patankar was offered employment by Excom were aspirational in the sense that they merely sought to describe the attitude that would inform the way in which Excom would conduct staff performance reviews ( Whitlock v Brew [1968] HCA 71 ; (1968) 118 CLR 445 ; Bishop v Taylor [1968] HCA 68 ; (1968) 118 CLR 518).

Its concerns were rational. It does not appear that its manner of questioning was inappropriate."
cited,British Broadcasting Corporation v British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd [1992] Ch 141,"It is unnecessary to compare minutely the length of time taken in these examples of other media, given the respondents' evidence as to the impugned broadcasts. It may be, and I do not make a finding about this now, that even by these standards, that is the standards of pay television and free to air television, it will be found, that the respondents have, to put it bluntly, been a little greedy in what they have taken for the dealing to be fair as well as newsworthy. Ultimately, that will be a matter of judgment and impression, see British Broadcasting Corporation v British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd [1992] Ch 141 and Hubbard v Vosper [1972] 2 QB 84 and other cases. It is not clear to me that that judgment ought be made, that is, that there has been a taking of too much by reference to the benchmark of free to air and pay television. As I said, it is unnecessary to pursue this judgmental analysis given the way the matter has been argued. My doubts and uncertainties about whether what has been done, goes beyond fair dealing, is strengthened by some evidence concerning the approach of Telstra itself in negotiating with the Australian Football League (the ""AFL"") in December 2005. Telstra in those negotiations was seeking to reach agreement with that other sporting code about the same kind of rights that it has been able to extract by agreement from the NRL."

cited,F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commissioner of Patents [1971] HCA 3 ; (1971) 123 CLR 529 ,"Counsel for Sanofi-Aventis submitted that enabling disclosure, not mere disclosure, is required for anticipation, citing, most recently, Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 559 at [160] [161] and the decision of the House of Lords in SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323. By way of introduction, it is worth remarking that the phrase ""enabling disclosure"" was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 , (1996) 36 IPR 438. That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the 1997 United Kingdom Act (based upon the European Patent Convention) but did not concern the question of anticipation. The most important question was whether a later patent could claim an earlier priority date because it was ""supported"" by the earlier specification. That is a concept similar to, but narrower than, whether a later patent is fairly based upon an earlier specification in our law (cf F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commissioner of Patents [1971] HCA 3 ; (1971) 123 CLR 529 ; CCOM Pty Ltd v Jiejing Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1168 ; (1994) 51 FCR 260 ; Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274). It may be accepted that, in the case of a claim for a chemical compound by formula, in order to be valid, the specification would have to disclose how it might be manufactured (s 40). The phrase was also used in the speech of Lord Oliver in Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK's Application [1991] RPC 485 , to which I shall return. The phrase is reasonable shorthand in relation to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but, in my opinion, has little, if any, relevance to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula. Indeed, it is apt to mislead in relation to the latter. For a product claim, the novelty must lie in the product not the means of producing it ( May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255 at 281 282). By the same token, a new process to obtain an old product will have novelty."

The clause is confined in its operation "" by reference to the context in which [it] appear[s] and by reference to the commercial purpose for which [it was] intended to serve "": Fountain at 11,819-11,820.

In that case Bryson J rejected the idea that the entitlement of witnesses to be reimbursed for their costs and expenses could be established by reference to conflicting decisions from long ago affected by a Tudor statute long since repealed. He said (35 NSWLR at 688) that the matter should be approached as one of principle and, according to principle it ""is a necessary incident of the exercise by the court of its subpoena power that the court should deal with the question of paying persons whose time and attention are involved in the exercise"". That is, the court has an inherent jurisdiction to award in favour of a witness such costs as it thinks appropriate to compensate the witness for his time and expenses incurred in compliance with a subpoena. Thus it has been said, correctly in my opinion, that the rules that fix costs for witnesses ""represent[s] but an aspect of the more comprehensive jurisdiction in respect of persons subjected to compulsion by the processes of the Court in proceedings to which they are not parties"": Re Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Selim v McGrath (2004) 48 ACSR 681, 690 per Barrett J."
cited,NAAH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 354,"finding of the Tribunal that the sole or predominant reason for his being targeted by the Maoists was the satisfaction of a personal grudge against him was, so submits the first respondent, a finding of fact which cannot be reviewed: Peiris v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 58 ALD 413 at [18]-[23]; Buultjens v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1058 at [12] and [13]. The first respondent further submits that the Court should not too readily find error in such a finding of non-satisfaction: NAAH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 354 at [27] ; NATC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 52 at [27] . To do so, it submits, would involve the Court transgressing into merits review or finding that there was only one reasonable finding open to the Tribunal, being Convention related persecution for reason of political opinion or membership of a particular social group, notwithstanding the lack of evidence to support such an inference. Finally, it contends that there was no evidence that the Maoists in question wanted to harm the appellant because he was an agent of the state and the Court should not reconstruct those claims in a different or more articulate manner than they were put to the Tribunal: S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 203 ALR 112 at [1] ; NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 at [58] ."
cited,Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378,"A power to make an order that no legal proceedings should be instituted by a person without the leave of a judge of the Court is, however, conferred on the Court by the Federal Court Rules . One such relevant rule is O 21 r 1. In Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 (affirmed on appeal, Skyring v Ramsey [2000] FCA 774) , Sackville J upheld the validity of O 21 r 1 in its then form. His Honour regarded the rule as falling within the rule making power conferred on the court by the Parliament in s 59(1) and s 59(2)(l) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 . Order 21 r 1 has since been amended but not in any way which would call into question the continuing relevance of the conclusion reached by Sackville J. Those provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act also support the validity of the other relevant rule, O 21 r 2. 46 So far as presently material and as at the time when the Respondent's application was heard and written submissions made, O 21, r 1 and r 2 provided: 1 Vexatious litigant (1) If a person institutes a vexatious proceeding and the Court is satisfied that the person has habitually, persistently and without reasonable grounds instituted other vexatious proceedings in the Court or any other Australian court (whether against the same person or against different persons), the Court may order: (a) that any proceeding instituted by the person may not be continued without leave of the Court; and (b) that the person may not institute a proceeding without leave of the Court. (2) An order under this rule may be made: (a) on the Court's own motion; or (b) on the application of the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or (c) on the application of the Registrar. 2 Vexatious proceeding against a person Where any person (in this rule called the vexatious litigant) habitually and persistently and without any reasonable ground institutes a vexatious proceeding against any person (in this rule called the person aggrieved) in the Court, the Court may, on application by the person aggrieved, order that the vexatious litigant shall not, without leave of the Court, institute any proceeding against the person aggrieved in the Court and that any proceeding instituted by the vexatious litigant against the person aggrieved in the Court before the making of the order shall not be continued by him without leave of the Court. 47 Order 21 r 1(2) has since been amended so as to allow an application under O 21 r 1 to be made by, relevantly, ""a person against whom the person mentioned in subrule (1) has instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings"". This amendment, being procedural, would now give the Respondents a standing which they did not hitherto have to seek relief pursuant to O 21 r 1, providing, of course, that they were persons in respect of whom a vexatious proceeding had been instituted. The standing to bring an application under O 21 r 2, as the then language of that rule provided, was more accommodating for persons in the position in which the respondents allege themselves to be. 51 Discrete applications in the original jurisdiction for relief under O 21 were made in Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 , National Australia Bank Limited v Freeman (a Bankrupt) [2005] FCA 1895 (Spender J) (affirmed, Freeman (a bankrupt) v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 ; (2006) 230 ALR 213) and Granich and Associates v Yap [2004] FCA 1567 (French J). 54 Nonetheless, I note that in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd) (2007) 242 ALR 370 Finn J entertained, but did not grant, an application made in an existing proceeding for relief under O 21 r 1 and r 2 as a sequel to a summary judgment application. Though the effect, if any, of O 21 r 3 with respect to the practice and procedure in respect of seeking to engage the powers conferred by O 21 r 1 and r 2 is not mentioned in that case, neither it must be said, is it mentioned in Ramsey v Skyring, National Australia Bank Limited v Freeman (a Bankrupt) and Granich and Associates v Yap . 58 In Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd) (2007) 242 ALR 370 at 380, [44], Finn J observed of O 21 r 1 and r 2: [44] By way of background to the application of these provisions, it is important to have regard to the fundamental principle on which they entrench. This is that every person has a ""constitutional right"" of access to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain redress in consequence of an alleged breach of his or her rights by some other person: Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau Und Maschinenfabrik v South India Shipping Corp Ltd [1981] AC 909 at 977 ; [1980] 1 All ER 289 at 295; Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 at 389 ; [1999] FCA 907 ; Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 ; (2006) 230 ALR 213 at 218 19 ; [2006] FCAFC 67. The purpose of the powers given under the Rules is to reinforce the power of the court to protect its own processes against unwarranted usurpation of its time and resources and to avoid the loss caused to those who have to face actions which lack any substance: Jones v Skyring [1992] HCA 39 ; (1992) 109 ALR 303 at 312; [1992] HCA 39 ; 66 ALJR 810 at 814. This said, an order under the Rules will not lightly be made because of its serious impact on the right of access to the courts of this country."
referred to,Commissioner of Taxation v Rowe (1995) 60 FCR 99,"If legal expenses are properly treated as having been incurred by a taxpayer in defending the manner of his performance of his duties, the expenses will be deductible. If a liability is incurred, or a claim is encountered, because of the very act of performing the work by which a taxpayer earns assessable income, the expense will be deductible. If a proceeding in respect of which legal expenses are incurred arises from activities by which a taxpayer earns his income or the mode of his performance of a particular task carried out in the course of earning his income, the legal expenses incurred in relation to that proceeding will be deductible. That is to say, if the cause or the purpose of a taxpayer's incurring of legal expenses is his assertion that he had faithfully performed the duties by which he had earned assessable income, the expenditure will be deductible ( Commissioner of Taxation v Rowe (1995) 60 FCR 99 at 113 (' Rowe '). 34 If incurring costs can be shown to contribute to the success of an employee in defending himself from dismissal from his employment and costs are incurred to preserve the employee's entitlement to receive, in return for his services, assessable income, the costs will be deductible ( Rowe at 115-116). If legal expenses are incurred by an employee in defending himself from dismissal, the expenditure will be incurred on revenue account and not capital account ( Rowe at 118). Whether or not legal expenses constitute an outgoing of a capital nature or an outgoing on account of revenue depends upon the cause or the purpose of incurring the expense. It is therefore necessary to consider the object in view when the legal proceedings were undertaken or the situation that impelled a taxpayer to undertake the proceedings ( Hallstroms Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 647)."

discussed,"Minister for Lands, Planning &amp; Environment (2004) 14 NTLR 188","That same issue occurred in relation to proposals to acquire native title rights and interests, or certain of them, in the Town of Timber Creek. On 31 July 2003, a judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory decided that such notices were invalid as being beyond power in the circumstances: Griffiths v Lands and Mining Tribunal and Minister for Lands Planning and the Environment (2003) 179 FLR 241. That decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory: Minister for Lands, Planning &amp; Environment (2004) 14 NTLR 188. The High Court subsequently granted leave to appeal from that decision. On 15 November 2007, judgment on the appeal was reserved. It addresses questions as to whether s 43 of the Lands Acquisition Act permits the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests in land for the purpose of extinguishing native title in order to alienate land for the private benefit of another citizen; whether s 24MD of the NT Act permits the acquisition of native title rights and interests in land for the purpose of vesting the affected land in the Northern Territory freed and discharged of the native title rights and interests; and whether s 46 of the Lands Acquisition Act is repugnant to s 238 of the NT Act."
cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216,"[26], the Tribunal noted that in the absence of any variation to the contracts, the amounts that would have been deductible under s 82AAC of the Act as superannuation contributions were in 1997 $27,170.00 (Mr Mark Trail) and $9,782.00 (Mr Allan Trail) and in 1998, $28,620.00 (Mr Mark Trail) and $10,232.00 (Mr Allan Trail). At [27], the Tribunal noted that s 177C(1)(b) requires the making of an hypothesis as to what might reasonably be expected to have happened had the scheme not been entered into or carried out. The Tribunal noted the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216 at 243 [66] that the enquiry directed by Part IVA requires comparison between the scheme in question and an alternative postulate. The Tribunal also noted that the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 determined that a reasonable expectation requires more than a possibility with the result that the prediction must be sufficiently reliable for it to be regarded as reasonable. The matter is to be remitted to the Tribunal to determine the questions before it by applying the test so as to determine whether there is evidence which supports an hypothesis that the taxpayer would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken a particular activity in lieu of the scheme and whether that activity would or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in an allowable deduction of the same kind as the deduction claimed by the taxpayer under the scheme consistently with the methodology identified in the authorities and in particular, Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody (1994) 181 CLR 359; Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo (2008) 167 FCR 255 at 278 [121] to [125] and [128]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404."
applied,Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076,"76 of the Code sets out certain matters as relevant matters to which the Court should have regard in determining an appropriate pecuniary penalty.

followed,Reg v Hunt; Ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 32 ; (1979) 180 CLR 322,"In Reg v Hunt; Ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 32 ; (1979) 180 CLR 322 at 329, Mason J, with whom Gibbs J agreed at 324, explained the significance of a statutory requirement that a decision-maker ""have regard to"" costs necessarily incurred in providing nursing home care in a particular nursing home when determining a scale of fees. Mason J said that the expression ""have regard to"" required the decision-maker to take the costs into account and give them weight ""... as a fundamental element in making his determination"": Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329. He explained that in that case there were two reasons for such a construction, first, that the costs were the only matter explicitly mentioned as a matter to be taken into account and, secondly, the scheme of the provisions was that once an approval were given, the proprietor of the nursing home was not permitted to exceed the scale of fees fixed by the decision-maker. 104 As Mason J pointed out the section did not require the decision-maker there to fix the scale of fees exclusively by reference to particular costs. The decision-maker was entitled to have regard, he said, to other relevant considerations. But, the function of the decision-maker was to determine a scale of fees for the particular nursing home, not all nursing homes. Thus the Act directed that regard be had to the costs incurred in providing care in that nursing home: Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329. 105 I am of opinion that when s 152CR(1)(d) required the Commission, in making a final determination, to take into account Telstra's direct costs of providing access to the ULLS in the manner the Commission proposed, it was required to take that matter into account, together with the other matters referred to in the section, and to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making its decision: The Queen v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited [1982] HCA 69 ; (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 333 per Gibbs CJ applying what Mason J had said in Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329 to a section requiring a decision-maker to take a variety of matters into account. Mason J said that the requirement to have regard to a matter meant that it would become a central element for the decision-maker in his considerations: Meneling Station 158 CLR at 338. And, as he later explained in his classic judgment in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. Mason J said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, but the preferred ground on which that power was to be exercised was that the decision was ""manifestly unreasonable"". A person entrusted with a discretion must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 39 per Mason J applying Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 KB 223 at 228 per Lord Greene MR. 108 Because s 152CR(1) required it to take into account each of the seven specified factors, the Commission had to give each of them appropriate consideration in arriving at its final determination. The number and variety of factors which a statute requires a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to in arriving at a decision necessarily affects the weight any one of those factors must be given in the deliberative process. In Sean Investments [1979] HCA 32 ; 180 CLR 322 , the costs were fundamental - or foundational - because they were the only matter which the statute prescribed. The subject matter, scope and purpose of the statutory power provide a context in which to assess the duties it imposes on the decision-maker in any particular situation: cf: Foster v Minister for Customs [2000] HCA 38 ; (2000) 200 CLR 442 at 452 [22] - [23] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, Gaudron and Hayne JJ agreeing with their Honours at 454 [32]."
cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323,"I respectfully agree with the Federal Magistrate. It is clear that the Tribunal did consider each of the issues it was required to consider for the purposes of making a decision. Section 430(1)(c) of the Act requires the Tribunal to set out the findings which it made and which it considered to be material. It does not oblige the Tribunal to make findings on every question of fact which is objectively material ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [9] and [67] [68]). There is no jurisdictional error in circumstances where the Tribunal has not specifically made mention of a particular piece of evidence in its reasons. As Jarrett FM said at [36], ' the case put by the [appellant] was considered, but rejected, by the Tribunal '. 35 This ground of appeal has not been established. 36 The appellant's complaint is that the Tribunal failed to identify the relevant principles for the determination of a particular social group within the meaning of Article 1A(2) of the Convention. The Tribunal did not discuss the principles of such determination. Federal Magistrate Jarrett pointed out at [38] that the appellant did not put her case on the basis that she was a member of a particular social group. The Minister concedes that the Tribunal did not follow the usual course when determining whether a group or class to which an appellant claims to belong is capable of constituting a particular social group under the Convention; namely whether there is an identifiable social group and whether the appellant is a member of such a group."
discussed,Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656,"significance of the distinction, if legally there is one, was not made clear. It is argued that the Housing Associations could not alienate their interests in the town camps under the respective Special Purposes Leases or Crown Leases either absolutely or for 40 years. That was said to flow from the proper construction and understanding of the objects and purposes of the Housing Associations. I have already addressed that contention. No reason was put why those objects and purposes should impose restrictions on the powers of the Housing Associations which preclude their capacity to agree to the proposed subleases as Housing Associations, and different restrictions on their powers because of the interests of their members as a whole. The plurality judgment in Gambotto 182 CLR pointed out at 444 that the observations of Lindley MR in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656 at 671 that the power of the majority to alter the articles of association of a company must be exercised in a lawful manner and ""bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole"" was inappropriate where the proposed resolution involved a conflict of interests and advantages. The plurality judgment said at 444: It seems to us that, in such a case not involving an actual or effective expropriation of shares or of valuable proprietary rights attaching to shares, an alteration of the articles by special resolution regularly passed will be valid unless it is ultra vires, beyond any purpose contemplated by the articles or oppressive as that expression is understood in the law relating to corporations."
referred to,Hadjimouratis v Casanova [2005] FMCA 1468,"Federal Court is a superior court (FCA Act, s 5(2)) and therefore, whatever the nature of the defect or defects in the proceedings, the sequestration order is not void or a nullity in the sense that it is without legal effect: see Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5 ; (1944) 68 CLR 571 at 590 per Rich J; Emanuele v ASC [1997] HCA 20 ; (1997) 188 CLR 114 at 119, 120 per Brennan CJ and at 156 per Kirby J; Re Anasis; Ex parte Total Australia Ltd (1985) 63 ALR 493 at 496 and Re Fuller [1999] FCA 1811 at [13] [16] per Hill J. This principle applies to orders made by registrars of the Federal Court pursuant to the scheme of delegation of powers under s 35A of the FCA Act: Official Trustee v Nedlands [2000] FCA 599 ; (2000) 173 ALR 255 at [22] [25] per Finn J. 88 In Cameron v Cole the High Court held that the Federal Court of Bankruptcy was a superior court and Williams J, whose dissent was not on this point, said (at 607): 'When, therefore, the Federal Court of Bankruptcy has made a sequestration order under the Act, it is not, in my opinion, a nullity, so that, even if it has been irregularly obtained, it operates until it is set aside and causes the debtor to become a bankrupt and his property to vest in the official receiver...' The sequestration order in the present case is therefore, at worst, voidable and was effective to bankrupt Ms Cross when it was made. The question of whether it can truly be seen to be voidable depends upon the applicability and operation of s 306. Section 306 only applies to a formal defect or an irregularity but where that precondition is satisfied, it operates automatically: Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; 165 CLR 71 at 81. As the High Court said in Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 225 ALR 396 at [24] , the composite expression 'a formal defect or an irregularity' conveys a meaning with elements of both inclusion and exclusion. The Court went on to say (at [26]): 'The question of construction raised by the words ""a formal defect or an irregularity"" is one to be decided by reading s 306 in the context of the whole Act, informed by the general purpose of the legislation, and the particular purpose of the provisions relating to bankruptcy notices. It is similar to the question that, in former times, would be explained by asking whether a statutory requirement was mandatory or directory. In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority it was said: ""A better test ... is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of [a] provision should be invalid ... In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to 'the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute'"".' The High Court also held that the kind or degree of breach is relevant to a consideration of s 306 and that if a defect could cause substantial injustice, it may not easily be classified as a formal defect or irregularity: see [18], [22]. Ultimately, the characterisation of a defect as formal or substantive is a matter for judgment, however, it is first necessary to consider, as the High Court has indicated, the legislative regime in relation to, in this case, creditors' petitions. A useful starting point is the analysis of Burchett J in Re Millar; Ex parte Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia (No 388/1993, unreported, 27 April 1993), where his Honour first set out what the Full Court had said in Ginnane v Diners Club Limited (1993) 120 ALR 375 at 376: 'Paragraph 52(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that at the hearing of a creditor's petition, the Court shall require proof of the service of the petition and, if it is satisfied with the proof of that service, as well as the other matters specified in sub-section 52(1), it may make a sequestration order against the estate of the debtor. Sub-section 52(2) provides, among other things, that if the Court is not satisfied with the proof of the service of the petition, it may dismiss the petition. These provisions illustrate a unique prescription relating to a petition for a sequestration order. A sequestration order affects the status of a person. The Legislature, in recognition of this feature, has insisted that the petitioner must prove, among other things, service of the petition on the debtor.' Burchett J went on to say: 'If one turns to s 52 of the Act, the force of what their Honours say is immediately apparent. It is a peculiar feature of litigation under the Bankruptcy Act , upon a creditors petition, that the court is expressly required to hear proof of service of the petition, and is expressly required, if it is not satisfied with the proof (among other things) of that matter, to dismiss the petition. It seems to me very difficult to regard s. 306 as capable of avoiding the consequences of any serious default, in respect of the requirements regarding the service of the petition so specifically stated in s. 52 , on the basis that such a serious default would be a mere formal defect or an irregularity. The requirements of s. 52 are essential requirements for the proof of the petition. They are made essential, no doubt, because the law recognises that proceedings in bankruptcy have an extraordinarily far reaching effect, not only upon the status of the debtor but also so as to convert, in some cases, actions and omissions of his in the past which at the time they were done or omitted did not constitute any offence into serious criminal offences.' It is clear from what his Honour said that having regard to the purposes of the statutory regime a serious breach of the requirements of service was intended by the legislature to lead to invalidity, in the sense that it would not constitute a mere formal defect to which s 306 would apply. This analysis echoes what the High Court said in Adams v Lambert , namely that the kind or degree of the breach is relevant to a consideration of s 306. In Re Ditfort; Ex Parte DCT (1988) 19 FCR 347, which was an application for annulment, Gummow J expressed agreement with the proposition, advanced by Walters J in Re Long; Ex parte Fraser Confirming Pty Ltd (1975) 12 SASR 130, that there is a necessity for strictness of proof in observance of the requirements for service of bankruptcy notices and bankruptcy petitions. His Honour said (at 359 360): 'Whilst not necessarily being of the view that s 306 can never apply in such a case in any circumstances, I respectfully agree with what was said by his Honour as to the importance of proper proof in these cases, and as to the salutary consequences for creditors of failure to comply with the rules...' In this case the relevant rules are, of course, the provisions of O 43 r 13 which set in place a special regime for service. The provisions of sub-rule 13(6) reflect the position in England as it became after Judicature: See, T Snow et a., The Annual Practice , 11 th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1893 at 248; T W Chitty, Chitty's Archbold's Practice of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice 14 h edn, H Sweet &amp; Son, London, 1885 at 1144. The practice in Chancery before Judicature was that 'service of a copy of the bill was effected in the ordinary manner' ( Annual Practice, supra, at 248). The Rules of Court in the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) 38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 77 provided, relevantly in O 9 r 5: 'When a lunatic or person of unsound mind not so found by inquisition is a defendant to the action, service on the committee of the lunatic, or on the person with whom the person of unsound mind resides or under whose care he or she is , shall unless the Court or Judge otherwise orders, be deemed good service on such defendant.' (Emphasis added) In The Fore Street Warehouse Company Limited v Durrant &amp; Co. (1883) 10 Q.B.D. 471 the writ had been served on the lunatic defendant's business manager. Grove J said of the rule (at 473): 'I think the principle of this rule is that the service should be on some person qualified to act for the lunatic or most likely to know to whom the fact of service ought to be communicated. The manager of the lunatic's business might be ignorant of these matters. Where the writ is served in such a manner that it may probably never reach the lunatic, I do not think it can be valid and proper service. The plaintiffs may reasonably be required to go through the formalities which may give the friends of the lunatic a proper opportunity of appearing.' It is also useful to consider what has been said about the next step in the process contemplated by the rules, namely the appointment of a next friend or tutor. The Rules of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and in particular those which preceded the recent uniform civil procedure regime, are in a similar form to those which operate in this Court. In State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Hammond (1988) 15 NSWLR 395 Kirby P, with whom Hope and Mahoney JJA agreed, explained (at 400) that: '... the provisions of Pt 63, r 2 [which establishes the procedural requirement of a next friend] are simply machinery or procedure provisions. They are designed, principally, to ensure that there is someone answerable to the court on behalf of the litigant, with a disability; that crucial decisions affecting that litigant can be properly and responsibly made; and that a person exists who can bear any costs as are ordered against the person with the disability at the end of the litigation.' Two features of the language of O 43 r 13 merit particular consideration. First, while the machinery provisions of O 43 r 13, namely, sub-rules (3) (6) use the word 'may', one must take into account sub-rule (2) which provides: '(2) Personal service on a person under a disability shall not be effected otherwise than in accordance with this rule.' Second, a certain tension seems to arise within the rule when ones comes to sub-rule (4), which provides: '(4) The document may be served on any person (including the person under disability) whom the Court may, before or after service , approve.' However, when one bears in mind the purpose of this rule and its place in the broader rules as to litigation involving disabled persons, there is no tension between sub-rules (2) and (4). One can readily imagine a case where the Court would approve a particular person upon whom service could be effected. Indeed, it would be a prudent course to obtain such approval in advance of proceeding against a disabled person. On the other hand, where service has taken place in breach of the rule but those who care for the disabled person nevertheless appear at Court and no injustice has been occasioned by the breach of the rules, one appreciates how the Court might approve service which has already taken place. The discretion in sub-rule (4) is premised upon the mandatory nature of the rule, as reflected in the language of sub-rule (2). Where the objects of the rule have otherwise been achieved, it facilitates the proceedings moving forward by validating service which would have otherwise been prohibited. It is also important to note that the rules expressly reject the idea that one might serve, perhaps out of an abundance of caution, both the person designated by sub-rule 13(6) and the mentally disabled person with an initiating process such as a creditor's petition. The course which is not only to be preferred but which appears to be required is to approach the Court for a grant of approval. Only in relation to the limited class of documents in sub-rule (8) is a different approach to be adopted. Thus, in their general application the special rules as to service firmly ensure that their aim is attained, namely that an opportunity is afforded to those who care for a mentally disabled person to appear before the Court and to represent and protect that person's interests where by definition he or she does not have the capacity to do so alone. The existence of a facility for the proceedings to move forward once that aim has been achieved does not detract from the control which the Court maintains over this step in proceedings against mentally disabled persons. In bankruptcy proceedings the legislature has protected all debtors by requiring proof of service of the petition in every instance. In the case of mentally disabled persons that protection extends to the requirement to serve in accordance with the special rules designed to ensure that the opportunity is a real one. In my judgment, strict compliance with the provisions of O 43 r 13 is necessary in bankruptcy proceedings. A breach of these rules could result in substantial injustice being visited upon the disabled respondent. Moreover, a serious breach could defeat the intention of the O 43 altogether and lead to a breach of the fundamental rules of natural justice. The FCR require service upon a particular person and that was not done. The FCR also prohibit service upon the disabled person and that was ignored. The conduct of the Creditor constituted a serious breach of the FCR and resulted in a defect in the proceedings which was not a formal one. Section 306 does not apply and the sequestration order is voidable. The separate question of whether substantial injustice has been occasioned by the defect in these proceedings does not arise. In any event, I am of the opinion that in all the circumstances of this case substantial injustice has been occasioned by the defect which cannot be remedied by order of the Court save to set aside the sequestration order and dismiss the petition. The Annulment Issue It is quite clear that Ms Cross should not have been bankrupted. She was solvent at the time. A creditor who issues a creditor's petition runs the risk that if the debtor is solvent, the likelihood is that the petition will be dismissed with costs. The evidence suggests that Ms Cross, due to her state of mind, may have thought that the body corporate of her home unit building did not exist and that she therefore did not owe it any money. Whether that be right or not, bankruptcy proceedings are not for debtors who won't pay debts. They are for debtors who can't pay debts. As the Full Court said in Sarina v Council of the Shire of Wollondilly (1980) 48 FLR 372 at 376: 'In bankruptcy, rights of creditors to sue the bankrupt are converted into rights of proof against his estate and he is protected from suit. The avoidance of preferences, voluntary settlements and fraudulent dispositions of property by the bankrupt is intended to restore the property or money of the bankrupt to his estate to achieve a fair and rateable division of the bankrupt's property among his creditors. The bankrupt is disqualified from holding certain offices. Bankruptcy involves a change of status and quasi-penal consequences. Upon discharge from bankruptcy, the bankrupt is released form his debts subject to certain exceptions. These considerations negate the existence of any policy underlying the Act that a debtor should be made bankrupt if he is able to pay his debts but is unwilling to do so. If a debtor is able to pay his debts but is recalcitrant, his creditors may resort to the remedies otherwise afforded by the law such as execution against his property and garnishee proceedings. The words ""able to pay his debts"" in s. 52(2) of the Act do not mean ""willing and able"" to do so .' (Emphasis added) The parties are agreed that the bankruptcy should be brought to an end, the only question being how that should be achieved. By her motion, Ms Cross seeks to have the sequestration order made by the registrar on 9 August 2004 set aside. In opposing the motion, the Creditor and the Trustee contend that the appropriate course is to make an order pursuant to s 153B(1) of the Act annulling the bankruptcy. In a normal case, annulment is undoubtedly the appropriate course; but this is anything but a normal case. The matter which evokes the response on the part of the Trustee to oppose the motion is that in the case of annulment, the Trustee gets the benefit of s 154(1)(b) of the Act, namely, he may apply the property of Ms Cross still vested in him the home unit at 12/28 Tullimbar Road, Cronulla in payment of the costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy, including the remuneration and expenses of the Trustee; whereas, if the sequestration order is set aside, he has no such right of application. The Creditor's opposition to the setting aside of the sequestration order is no doubt sourced in the consequential orders I would make of dismissing the petition and revoking the costs order made by the registrar on 9 August 2004. At the outset, it may be said that there is no longer any third course, for example, rescission of the sequestration order: See s 37(2) of the Act; Vaucluse Hospital Pty Ltd v Phillips &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 44 at [19] and [20]. On the other hand, reviews of registrar's orders, like appeals to the Full Court, are outside the intended ambit of s 37. At the forefront of Ms Cross' case is that she was bankrupted on the first return date of a creditor's petition which was left with her while she was an involuntary patient in the Psychiatric Unit of Sutherland Hospital, but which I have found was not properly served, for a debt in respect of unpaid body corporate levies of $1,813.58, increased to approximately $2,400 by debt collection, legal and court costs of obtaining a default judgment in respect thereof; when, on the evidence before me, she owned assets in excess of half a million dollars including the home unit worth $375,000, money on deposit with major banks of more than $130,000 and shares and securities in major listed companies worth approximately $90,000. Moreover, Ms Cross was not present when the sequestration order was made. Had she, or representatives on her behalf, been present on the day, or if her circumstances and the circumstances of service of the Creditor's petition had been ventilated with the registrar on 9 August 2004 rather than being left buried in some affidavit of service, I have no doubt that the sequestration order would not have been made. Mr Bentley, in his submissions, said: 'At this point I would just like to also make this quite clear that my friend made some submissions about what happened in front of Registrar Tesoriero but that affidavit of Mr Wellmeela clearly says that she was served in a psychiatric unit. There is no hiding that, the documentation which was presented to the court clearly stated the fact. Now I presented that petition but unfortunately so long ago I can't remember what was said. I have a vague recollection that something may have been said about it but I can't recall and I am unable to assist the court or swear an affidavit so I haven't but there is no doubt that it is quite clear in evidence from Mr Wellmeela's affidavit what happened, where it happened and what was going on, so it is not as if anyone has tried to conceal this from the court or from the Registrar.' The fact is that Mr Bentley was the only person present before Registrar Tesoriero on 9 August 2004. He would not have been surprised at that. He certainly did not expect Ms Cross to be present. That he cannot remember what was said before the registrar on that day suggests to me that none of the relevant surrounding circumstances were brought to the registrar's attention because he, Mr Bentley, was blinded by an obsession to ensure that whatever else happened, Registrar Tesoriero made the sequestration order on that day. As an officer of the Court, he had an overriding duty to do more to draw to the Court's attention Ms Cross' circumstances and the circumstances under which she was purportedly served with the Creditor's petition. It is true that there has been some effluxion of time between the making of the sequestration order on 9 August 2004 and the filing of the motion on 7 November 2005. At least three things can be said about this, maybe more. First, there is no time limitation in which to bring a motion to set aside an order after it has been entered where the order has been made in the absence of a party: O35 r 7(2)(a) of the FCR, cf., s 35A(5) of the FCA Act and O 77 r 8 (now repealed) of the FCR. Second, there is a dearth of evidence as to what occurred in the period from 9 August 2004 until April 2005. It seems that the Trustee applied to become and became the registered proprietor of the home unit at Cronulla on or about 19 October 2004 but otherwise there was no administration of the bankrupt estate. The Legal Aid Commission became aware of Ms Cross' bankruptcy on or about 30 September 2004, nearly two months after she was made bankrupt. But otherwise there is no evidence as to what happened, if anything happened at all, in addition to the matters mentioned, during this period. In all the circumstances, I do not think this period should be counted as part of the effluxion of time. Third, on the evidence before me, the second period in the effluxion of time (from 11 April 2005 until 7 November 2005) was taken up by the OPC discovering the relevant evidence as to what took place, obtaining legal advice thereon and, on the basis of that advice, deciding what action was to be taken. In all the circumstances I do not find the second period so long as to militate against exercising my discretion to set aside the sequestration order rather than annul the bankruptcy. In re Daskalavski (Applicant); Ex parte The Austral Brick co Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 782 , Emmett J (in a short ex tempore judgment) concluded that, in circumstances where his Honour was satisfied that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, it was appropriate to annul the bankruptcy rather than set it aside where the estate had already been administered in bankruptcy. But that is not the case here. Only one asset of Ms Cross, her home unit at Cronulla, has been vested in the Trustee and the debt on which she was bankrupted, together with subsequent unpaid strata levies, was paid out by the OPC, not the Trustee, following the Protective Commissioner being appointed the financial manager of Ms Cross' financial affairs by order of the Guardianship Tribunal dated 11 April 2003. Notwithstanding the Trustee's claim for remuneration to 3 June 2005 ($13,990) and his anticipated claim for additional remuneration ($5,500), there was no evidence that the Trustee had been actively involved in the administration of Ms Cross' bankrupt estate. CONCLUSION When this choice as between an order that the sequestration order be set aside on the one hand and an order for annulment of the bankruptcy on the other has come before the courts on earlier occasions, the courts have consistently stressed that a balance must be struck between the rights of the applicant, who should never have been made bankrupt in the first place, and the Trustee who has simply done what the Act requires him to do: Kyriackou v Shield Mercantile Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2004] FCA 1338 at [43] per Weinberg J; followed in Capsalis v Ozdemir [2005] FMCA 1163 at [17] per Connolly FM; Hadjimouratis v Casanova [2005] FMCA 1468 at [13] and [16] per Connolly FM; and in Vaucluse Hospital Pty Ltd v Phillips at [70] and [71] per Riethmuller FM. The rights of the petitioning creditor have never been referred to as a relevant factor, and understandably so. This is not a case where the pendulum of balance tilts in favour of Ms Cross (compare Kyriackou ) as against the Trustee; on the contrary, I have come to the firm conclusion that it would be totally unfair, indeed a miscarriage of justice, for Ms Cross to be saddled with any of the relatively considerable costs of the administration of her estate. While that may involve the invocation of some injustice on the Trustee, in the circumstances of this case it seems it must be tolerated in the face of an inability of the Court to order the petitioning creditor to bear such costs: Kyriackou at [39] per Weinberg J. For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that as being the correct position, however, I do not think it is free from doubt. The powers of the Court under s 30 of the Act are expressed in extremely wide terms. In the circumstances of this case, it seems unjust to me that the Creditor only has to pay the costs of the motion even though it also loses the registrar's order as to costs of the petition. Because of the conclusion I have come to as expressed in [116] supra, I propose to exercise my discretion under O 35 r 7 of the FCR to set the sequestration order aside. In the circumstances, it is only appropriate that I summarise the matters I have taken into account in exercising my discretion to do so: 1. The inappropriateness of bankruptcy proceedings as a debt collection remedy or mechanism. Such proceedings were never intended to operate against debtors who could, but would not, for whatever reason, pay. 2. The size of the debt originally less than $2,000. 3. The aggregate value (free of encumbrances) of Ms Cross' assets closer to $600,000 than $500,000, approximately $200,000 of which were in liquid form. 4. The size of the actual and anticipated costs and expense of administering the estate: In excess of $35,000, when, on the evidence, there was minimal administration. 5. The circumstances of Ms Cross' mental condition and her admissions (once involuntarily) to the Psychiatric Unit of Sutherland Hospital during 2004 for a total of over three months. 6. My finding that Ms Cross was not properly served with the Creditor's petition. 7. The fact that she was not present or represented at the hearing at which the sequestration order was made. 8. The fact that the circumstances referred to in 5 and those underlying my finding in 6 were not ventilated before the registrar on 9 August 2004 (the first return date of the petition) when the sequestration order was made. 9. The fact that those involved in ensuring that Ms Cross was bankrupted on 9 August 2004 Messrs Meuller and Bentley were officers of the Court. The orders of the Court will be: 1. Michael Gregory Jones, trustee of the bankrupt estate of Isabell Jean Cross, be joined as a party (second respondent) to the proceeding, effective 6 December 2005. 2. The orders of Registrar Tesoriero made 9 August 2004 be set aside and the Creditor's petition dated 4 March 2004 and filed 23 March 2004 be dismissed. 3. The costs of Ms Cross and of the Trustee of the motion be paid by the Creditor on an indemnity basis.

The rules and conventions governing such practice are not frozen in time. They develop to take account of the exigencies of modern litigation. At the trial level, modern judges, responding to a need for more active case management, intervene in the conduct of cases to an extent that may surprise a person who came to court expecting a judge to remain, until the moment of pronouncement of judgment, as inscrutable as the Sphinx. In Vakauta v Kelly , Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ, referring both to trial and appellate proceedings, spoke of "" the dialogue between Bench and Bar which is so helpful in the identification of real issues and real problems in a particular case "". Judges, at trial or appellate level, who, in exchanges with counsel, express tentative views which reflect a certain tendency of mind, are not on that account alone to be taken to indicate prejudgment. Judges are not expected to wait until the end of a case before they start thinking about the issues, or to sit mute while evidence is advanced and arguments are presented. On the contrary, they will often form tentative opinions on matters in issue, and counsel are usually assisted by hearing those opinions, and being given an opportunity to deal with them. (Emphasis added). 224 In Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 87 ALR 633, after comments set out in the above observation, Brennan, Deane, and Gaudron JJ said at p 635: It seems to us that a trial judge who made necessary rulings but otherwise sat completely silent throughout a non-jury trial with the result that his or her views about the issues, problems and technical difficulties involved in the case remained unknown until they emerged as final conclusions in her or her judgment would not represent a model to be emulated. 225 According to Direction 21: The object of the Act is to regulate, in the national interest, the coming into and presence in Australia of non-citizens. To facilitate this object, the Minister has been given a discretion to ... cancel a visa where ... the visa holder does not pass the Character Test. In exercising this power, the Minister has a responsibility to the Parliament and to the Australian community to protect the community from criminal or other reprehensible conduct and to ... cancel visas held by non-citizens whose actions are so abhorrent to the community that they should not be allowed to ... remain within it. (Emphases added). 226 In my opinion, the requirement of some nexus between the visa holder and the criminal conduct suspected of the person or group with whom the visa holder has an association, is reinforced by the terms of paragraph 1.5 of Direction 21."
considered,Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389,"The process of construction of the definition of 'service' and the expression 'use of a production process' must begin by examining the context in which the definition appears and giving the words 'presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances': Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 398 (' Agfa '), applying Maunsell v Olins [1975] AC 373 at 391. That is, the court must give the words a meaning which is consistent with the language and purpose of Part IIIA and the Act as a whole. It is important to remember that whilst for the purpose of these proceedings one focuses upon the definition of 'service', it is just that, a definition. One must consider the operative provision that incorporates that definition, and determine the purpose and ambit of the operative provisions. 168 The general rule of statutory interpretation is that words used in a statute are given their most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances. Consistent with a purposive approach to the interpretation of the expression 'use of a production process', the court would be entitled to receive expert economic evidence to assist in the interpretation of that phrase if it had a technical or specialised meaning: see, e.g. Agfa at 401; Pepsi Seven-Up Bottlers Perth Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 62 FCR 289 at 297-8; Re Michael ; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd (2002) 25 WAR 511 (' Re Michael ') at 543-544, [107].

referred to,Ex parte Vine; Re Wilson (1878) 8 Ch D 364,"The policy underlying the provision was explained by the Court of Appeal in Ex parte Vine; Re Wilson (1878) 8 Ch D 364 at 366-367 where James LJ (Cotton and Thesiger LJJ agreeing) said: The general principle always has been that, until a bankrupt has obtained his discharge, all his property is divisible among his creditors. But an exception was absolutely necessary in order that the bankrupt might not be an outlaw, a mere slave to his trustee; he could not be prevented from earning his own living. On that principle the trustee could not sue for moneys due to the bankrupt in respect of his personal labour, and, if the bankrupt could sue for them only for the benefit of his trustee, he would really be without remedy. 43 In those circumstances, the kinds of action contemplated by s 60(4) and s 116(2)(g) do not assist in determining whether the right to bring this proceeding is property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. This is not a proceeding of the kind contemplated by s 60(4) or s 116(2)(g). The question must be answered by reference to whether a proceeding of the kind brought by the applicant is property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. That question must be addressed by reference to s 116(1). 44 This proceeding is for an order quashing the respondents' decision to terminate the applicant's employment by reason of a failure by the second respondent to accord the applicant procedural fairness and by the improper exercise of power."
cited,"United States Surgical Corp v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, McClelland J, 13 October 1981)","The difficulty in Hoy's submissions is that, in the present case, the issue of election is not raised by Allphones but by Hoy itself in section K of its Statement of Claim. Allphones, in paragraph 44 of its Further Amended Defence, simply denies the allegation. Similarly, the allegation of bad faith is an issue raised by Hoy and denied by Allphones. In any event, it seems to me that the allegation of fraud puts in issue the state of mind of Hoy and not that of Allphones, and consequently it cannot be unfair or inconsistent for Allphones to retain its privilege with respect to records relating to its own state of mind. As McClelland J said in United States Surgical Corp v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd at 7 (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, McClelland J, 13 October 1981): '...before the privilege can be said to have been lost on this principle, one must at least be able to identify some element or feature of the claim made, or the evidence adduced, by the party otherwise entitled to the privilege , which would render reliance on the privilege unjust.' (Emphasis added.) 27 There is no unfairness, in my view, in maintaining the privilege claim by Allphones in these circumstances. It is not implicit in the denial of an allegation of bad faith that Allphones must in fairness make available otherwise privileged material relating to its state of mind simply because the other party has made the allegation. The position may be altered if Allphones were to positively assert and put in issue its state of mind by, for example, claiming that it had no reason to believe a certain matter existed or raising an issue of undue influence. But that is not this case. Such an allegation is the converse of this case, because Hoy, and not Allphones, has raised the issue."

discussed,M18/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 127,"The appellants appealed to a Full Court of this Court. The Full Court said, in M18/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 127 , at [10]-[11], as follows: ""In a notice of appeal filed on 1 December 2003, the appellant effectively repeated the ground raised before the primary judge. That is, it was alleged that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by considering dated and not recent country information and the primary judge erred in not concluding that the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error. For the reasons given by the primary judge, this contention is without substance."" 6 The Full Court also discussed the appellants' additional submissions, which sought to raise the 'medically unfit' ground mentioned in the draft order nisi filed in the High Court. The Court said, at [12]-[19]: ""In written submissions, the [first] appellant raised a number of additional issues. They included that she had been denied procedural fairness because she had been required to attend the hearing before the Tribunal at a time when she was medically unfit. The appellant also contended, in effect, that the Tribunal failed to take into account her mental state when assessing her evidence and, in particular, when considering the significance of her inability to name the Tamil boarders she claimed to have taken in during 1999. It is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons that the hearing was delayed for three months at the appellant's request because of a psychologist's report concerning the mental health of the appellant. That report recommended that the appellant should receive treatment for her condition in the interim. After the three months had passed, the Tribunal asked the appellant to attend a hearing on 25 May 2001 but, at the appellant's request (made on 24 May 2001) delayed that hearing until 31 May 2001. The Tribunal refused to delay the hearing for a longer period. It did so on the ground that the psychologist, although stating that the appellant still suffered from the same condition, reported that the appellant had not sought the recommended treatment. The appellant attended the delayed hearing with her legal representative. The appellant's amended application and written submissions before the primary Judge were prepared by counsel. That application and those submissions appear to have abandoned a complaint made in the draft order nisi that the appellant was denied procedural fairness (and that the Tribunal failed to follow procedures required by [the Act ] and misconceived its duty) because the hearing before the Tribunal took place when she was suffering from a mental disability. It may well be that the matter was not pursued in either the application or submissions because those advising the appellant considered a denial of procedural fairness was not a ground available under the then legislative regime. The allegation of denial of procedural fairness is not raised in the notice of appeal. However it is relatively clear the notice was prepared by the appellant without legal assistance. A full investigation of the consequences of any mental illness the appellant might have suffered at the time of the hearings before the Tribunal, would almost certainly have involved evidence being led before the primary judge. It was not."""
referred to,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SRT [1999] FCA 1197 ; (1999) 91 FCR 234,"Next the Authority submitted that Mr Seymour's argument was misconceived because it amounted to a collateral attack against his conviction which was impermissible ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SRT [1999] FCA 1197 ; (1999) 91 FCR 234 at 240-245; NSW Bar Association v Somosi (2001) 48 ATR 562 at 577 [80]-[81] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller and Giles JJA agreeing). It was submitted that the tribunal had to accept the conviction and the essential facts, that is, the ingredients of the offences found by Buddin J. That being so, it was said that there was no need in [37] of the tribunal's reasons to engage in an evaluation process of the matters to which it there referred particularly as the Authority argued that [37] incorporated a reference to the earlier findings at [8]-[15] of the tribunal's reasons. 134 Here, the tribunal had the benefit of the judgment of Buddin J. That revealed not only matters which went to the issues under s 290(2)(c) but also to those under ss 290(2)(h), namely any other matter relevant to Mr Seymour's fitness to give immigration assistance. It would be open to the tribunal to rely, as it did in [37]-[38] on the objective facts of Buddin J's decision and sentence irrespective of the technical, legal issue which it addressed, and I have also considered, as to whether the contempt was a 'criminal offence' for the purposes of either or both of ss 290(2)(c) or 312(1)(e). Even if the contempt was not a criminal offence, I am of opinion that the tribunal did not err in having regard to the findings and conclusions of Buddin J in his judgment (cf: Minister for Immigration v SRT [1999] FCA 1197 ; (1999) 91 FCR 234 at 244-245 [42] - [48] per Branson, Lindgren and Emmett JJ)."
referred to,Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589,"In my view, on his own material, those two clans are a mere subset of the FRBG.

applied,Webb v Bloch [1928] HCA 47 ; (1929) 41 CLR 331,"In the law of torts, the law has created the 'reasonable person'. In the law of defamation, from which the notion of republication may have been sourced, the question as to whether a subsequent publication was intended by the original publisher or was a natural and probable result of providing the information in the first place is assessed objectively ( John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Cojuangco [1988] HCA 54 ; (1988) 165 CLR 346 at 350: Webb v Bloch [1928] HCA 47 ; (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 363-366 and see as to the objective nature of the act of publication E Hulton &amp; Co v Jones [1910] AC 20). 76 In Webb v Block [1928] HCA 47 ; (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 367 Isaacs J used that passage to emphasise that omission of material matter can change the sense in which what is communicated is understood by the ordinary reasonable publishee, adding that such an omission could make what was published 'lie like truth' as in Lord Blackburn's famous speech in Smith v Chadwick (1884) 9 App Cas 187 at 201. And in a passage applied by the English Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v Kylsant (Lord) [1932] 1 KB 442 at 447-448, Lord Halsbury said in Aaron's Reefs Limited v Twiss [1896] AC 273 at 281: 'It remains only to consider the final question, namely, whether or not there was evidence for the jury which would justify them in finding that this was a fraudulent prospectus that these statements were fraudulent and false. Now, in dealing with that question, again I say I protest against being called on only to look at some specific allegation in it; I think one is entitled to look at the whole document and see what it means taken together . Now, if you look at the whole document taken together, knowing what we now know and what the jury had before them, I suppose nobody can doubt that this was a fraudulent conspiracy .... It is said there is no specific allegation of fact which is proved to be false. Again I protest, as I have said, against that being the true test. I should say, taking the whole thing together, was there false representation? I do not care by what means it is conveyed by what trick or device or ambiguous language: all those are expedients by which fraudulent people seem to think they can escape from the real substance of the transaction. If by a number of statements you intentionally give a false impression and induce a person to act upon it, it is not the less false although if one takes each statement by itself there may be a difficulty in shewing that any specific statement is untrue.'

followed,Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564,"making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the Court's discretion: Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-439 per Gibbs J; and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 ( 'Ainsworth' ) at 581-582 and 596-597. As a matter of substance, the dispute that AWB submitted to the Court for its adjudication was whether legal professional privilege did, or did not, attach to the documents in AWB's further revised list of privileged documents dated 7 August 2006 (as supplemented by letters from AWB's solicitors to the Court dated 25 August 2006 and 5 September 2006). In my opinion, any declarations made by the Court should reflect the final outcome of this case with certainty and precision. Moreover, it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court. I have concluded that the Court should make a declaration, reflecting my reasons for judgment, that legal professional privilege attaches to specified documents, and does not attach to other specified documents. Declaratory relief in this form is appropriate because it determines the legal controversy that was before the Court: see Ainsworth at 582 and 596-597; and Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 at 355-356. As AWB's application makes clear, the controversy includes the question whether the documents at issue are protected from production to the Commission by legal professional privilege. This controversy is only likely to be quelled, completely and finally, by making a declaration in the form I propose."

cited,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 94 ALR 11,"substantial proportion of Mr Hu's written submissions concerned the alleged failure of his Honour to identify apparently forged documents provided to Mr Hu by Ms Moser of MARA. The first point to note is that it was not the task of the Federal Magistrate to investigate whether documentation provided by MARA to Mr Hu was forged by the migration agent. In the circumstances of this case it was the task of the Federal Magistrate to consider whether there were grounds for an order of review of the decision of the respondent for any of the reasons set out in s 5 of the ADJR Act (cf comments of Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 94 ALR 11 at 26). Mr Hu's submissions in relation to this ground of appeal are, in substance, an attack on the qualifications and professional standards of his Honour in failing to identify forgeries claimed to exist by Mr Hu. In this respect this ground of appeal is completely without merit."
cited,Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1,"With reference to the eighth proposition, I note that the idea that the legal chose in action is held on trust after the consideration is paid in full is well accepted in the case law; see for example, the Australian cases Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1 at 26 27 and McIntyre v Gye (1994) 51 FCR 472 at 480 481, and the cases referred to in Meagher RP, Heydon JD and Leeming MJ, Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6-050]. The operative principle is that equity regards as done that which ought to be done, the assignor's conscience being bound to that end: Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999); Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523. There is, however, criticism of descriptions of the purchaser's equitable interest between contract and payment of the purchase money as that of a beneficiary under a trust; see for example Heydon JD and Loughlan PL, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (6 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6.7], [6.16] [6.18]. Dr Tolhurst goes further and suggests (op cit, [4.07]) an ""assignment analysis"" according to which, even in the former class of case (where the consideration for the assignment has been paid), a trust of the legal chose is unnecessary except as a remedial device granted by the court. In such a case, however, the case law is all one way in favour of a constructive trust arising as a matter of substantive law. In any event, his Lordship's evidence to that effect was not challenged."
cited,Dufty v City Mutual General Insurance Ltd [1977] Qld R 94,"There is an undated note taken by Mr Watson of a discussion with an officer of the insurer: Therefore, there is a requirement to work if capable. If the insured person returns to work at a reduced capacity, the income protection is replacement income (business related income). If expenses exceed other business income (ie ignoring the Income Protection benefit itself) then to sell off the business is against the intent of the insurance act and the insurance company would cease benefit until other work was obtained. In a practical sense, Mr Watson should take reasonable steps to ""mitigate his loss"". That obligation is one applicable to the measure of damages in all contracts. It does not apply as a term of the policy. Section 13 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) implies a term that each party to an insurance contract will act towards the other party with the utmost good faith. It could be expected that Mr Watson should therefore act reasonably in relation to the business activities or employment which he chooses to undertake: Dufty v City Mutual General Insurance Ltd [1977] Qld R 94. The element of reasonableness is also explained in cases such as Fidelity and Casualty Co of New York v Mitchell [1917] AC 592 ; Pocock v Century Insurance Co Ltd [1960] 2 Ll Rep 150; and Sergent v GRE (UK) Ltd [2000] Ll Rep 1R 77. That obligation extends to an insurer in determining whether an insured was totally and permanently disabled: see Beverley v Tyndall Life Insurance Co Ltd (1999) 10 ANZ Ins Cas 61-453. Reference may also be made to regs 17 and 18 of the Insurance Contracts Regulations 1985 (Cth) and to the decision in QBE Insurance Ltd v Jande (1995) 8 ANZ Ins Cas 61-270. Ultimately, the wording of the policy is the critical element."
cited,PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston [2005] FCA 344 ; (2005) 216 ALR 41,"a purposive approach to construction of the claims does not mean that clear limitations in the scope of the monopoly contained in the language of the claims can be avoided or the reach of the monopoly extended beyond the clear limits of the language selected. A purposive approach to construction as opposed to a purely literal one will raise the question of whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with the descriptive words or phrases used in a claim was intended to be an essential requirement of the invention. If so, as a matter of construction, a variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed even though it could have no material affect on the way the invention works. That question does not arise where the variant would in fact have a material affect upon the way the invention works ( Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 ; Kirin-Amgen Inc. v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444). The construction of the language of a claim, adopted by the Court, ultimately determines infringement.

cited,Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93,"BHPB relies on what it describes as a Calderbank letter (after Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93) , which it served on Cosco's lawyers before the trial. The relevant parts of the Calderbank letter read: ""[I]n a genuine attempt to resolve its dispute with both Cosco and [Seawise, the second respondent], our client would be prepared to accept the total of US$725,000 plus interest and costs as follows: (a) as to Cosco: US$550,000 (plus interest and costs to be agreed or otherwise taxed); (b) as to [Seawise]: US$175,000 (plus interest, and costs to be agreed or otherwise taxed). Clearly this figure represents a considerable reduction of our client's principal claim, and we would encourage your client to take advantage of this opportunity to resolve the claim promptly and in its entirety. Further, should Cosco and [Seawise], as between themselves, consider that a different division of the total amount of US$725,000 plus interest and costs occur, we would invite you to deal with that as you may see fit, provided the total of our client's offer is met."" For good reason BHPB was seeking to compromise its claims against both respondents. For that it wanted a total of US$725,000 plus interest plus costs. Accordingly, BHPB made an offer that could only be accepted by both respondents unless one agreed to pay the full claim with interest and costs, and the other respondent agreed to waive any claim for costs. According to the Calderbank principle, indemnity costs will not be ordered if a party acted reasonably in rejecting the Calderbank offer. Cosco's rejection of BHPB's Calderbank offer was reasonable. A party will be acting reasonably in rejecting a Calderbank offer if the offer is unclear or imprecise. In this case, BHPB's offer was imprecise in some respects. The offer did not specify a rate of interest, in circumstances where the applicable rate was open to argument. More importantly, it is unclear whether the offer was being made to Cosco alone, or Cosco and Seawise jointly. The offer appears to have been addressed to Cosco alone, but refers to both Cosco and Seawise making payments. If the offer was made to both Cosco and Seawise jointly, then this raises a further problem the offer was incapable of acceptance by Cosco alone. BHPB is not entitled to charge one offeree with indemnity costs for not having accepted an offer that was incapable of acceptance by that offeree alone. BHPB also seeks indemnity costs by reason of the abandonment by both respondents on the first and second days of the trial of several contentions raised in their respective defences on which BHPB had gone to the trouble of obtaining expert evidence from two lawyers. The particular contentions were that BHPB had failed to exercise rights of lien and possession with the consequence that it was the author of its own loss. These allegations made it necessary for BHPB to call expert evidence on English law (the law of the charterparty) and Thai law (the place where the Global Hawk was to discharge its cargo). The abandonment of part of the defence is not, without more, the occasion to award indemnity costs in respect of those costs which, in the event, have been unnecessarily incurred. Indemnity costs might be justified if the abandoned contentions were hopeless. That, however, is not what is argued here. What happened in this case was that BHPB filed the relevant expert reports around a month or so prior to the trial commencing. When BHPB's case in respect of the abandoned contentions was fully laid out, the respondents realised they could not meet it. So, by abandoning aspects of their respective defences, the respondents saved BHPB incurring unnecessary trial costs as well as saving court time. They should not be punished for that. Accordingly, up to the point where BHPB filed the expert reports, indemnity costs are clearly not warranted. Whether indemnity costs should be paid in respect of costs incurred after the filing of expert reports is more difficult. The respondents took more than a month after receiving the expert reports to indicate they were abandoning the contentions. During that period, BHPB may have incurred further costs regarding the abandoned contentions (although these costs may have been ameliorated by the fact that the experts were to give oral testimony via videolink). On balance, I consider that the respondents' delay in indicating their intentions to BHPB was not so great as to warrant the award of costs on an indemnity basis."
cited,Chan v Cresdon Pty Ltd [1989] HCA 63 ; (1989) 168 CLR 242,"turn to the nature of the interest of each retiree. In my view, each retiree had an equitable interest in the land by reason of the fact that each was entitled to specific performance of the Contract of Sale or Agreement for Sale of Real Estate or the Deed of Agreement to the possession of the property as a tenant immediately upon settlement. The extent of that interest is to be determined by the form in which specific performance would be granted by a court. The retirees were entitled as against MFLPH to an order requiring MFLPH to sign and deliver to the retirees upon settlement a lease of the property upon the terms agreed, relevantly for life, subject to the condition that the retiree stay in possession for a certain period and pay the nominal rent (see Downie v Lockwood [1965] VR 257; Craddock Bros v Hunt [1923] 2 Ch 136; Chan v Cresdon Pty Ltd (1989) 168 CLR 242; Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cauchi (2003) 217 CLR 315 at 332-333, [53]; Black v Garnock [2007] HCA 31 ; (2007) 230 CLR 438 at 449-450, [32] ). It is not necessary that specific performance be available at the time of the hearing: Bunny Industries Ltd v FSW Enterprises Pty Ltd [1982] Qd R 712. It is important to appreciate that the availability and the nature of specific performance is a precondition to the recognition of an equitable interest and the extent of that equitable interest in the property. Here, as I have said, a court, by reference to the terms of agreement between the retirees and MFLPH, would give each retiree possession of the land upon settlement by making an order that MFLPH sign and deliver a lease of the property to each retiree effective from the moment of settlement. First, the retirees argued that their entering into possession pursuant to an agreement to grant a lease and paying rent will give rise to a common law tenancy, citing Chan v Cresdon Pty Ltd [1989] HCA 63 ; (1989) 168 CLR 242. In that case, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and McHugh JJ stated (at 248): It is well settled that entry into occupation followed by payment of rent under an agreement for a future lease brings into existence a common law tenancy from year to year, so long as the payment of rent is referable to a yearly tenancy, as where it is for an aliquot part of a year..."

This may be contrasted with a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence, which does not form the basis of jurisdictional error: Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601. 34 In view of my decision with respect to evidence in this case, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the alternative issues raised by the appellant with respect to Wednesbury unreasonableness and irrationality and want of logic of the Tribunal's decision. However, I note the findings of his Honour below that reasoning of the Tribunal was neither illogical nor irrational and, having reviewed the decision of the Tribunal, consider that there is no error in his Honour's findings in relation to these contentions. In any event, these grounds do not appear to support claims of jurisdictional defect in terms of Australian law. In particular, I note the decision of the Full Court in Andary v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 211 with respect to Wednesbury unreasonableness, and the decisions of the High Court in Bond 170 CLR (particularly per Mason CJ at 356 with whom, on this point, Brennan, Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed) and the Full Court in VWST [2004] FCAFC 286 that want of logic does not form a valid basis of judicial review."

The first respondent submitted that the Tribunal is not required to investigate for itself whether the appellant's claims were true and is not required to ask the appellant to clarify any issues that the Tribunal finds to be vague, confused and contradictory. The Tribunal assessed the appellant's claims and set out its reasons why it did not accept them in the first respondent's submission, there can be no suggestion that the Tribunal is required to act otherwise. Additionally, the first respondent submitted that a finding on a credibility issue that was open to the Tribunal on the material before it does not give rise to an error of law: see Mashyekhi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2000] FCA 321 ; (2000) 97 FCR 381 and W148 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2001) 185 ALR 703."
referred to,Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647,if it had been established that the Tribunal had not complied with the requirements of s 43(2B) this would not have constituted a reviewable error of law which would justify the setting aside of the Tribunal's decision: see Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 445-6 (per Brennan J); Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 379 (per Kirby J); and see also Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647 at 656-9 (per Finkelstein J).

cited,Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163,"course, if Dornan is correct then, additionally, the Tribunal made an error of law. However, the significance of that for present purposes hinges upon whether that conclusion would lead to a different result. Clearly, such an approach would require the Tribunal to produce its reasons again. The difference would be that, if the error of law were jurisdictional the orders of the Tribunal might be set aside, it might have to re-exercise its powers afresh and it might have to do more than just produce reasons. I think it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional. It is true, no doubt, that generally, an error of law will, in the hands of a non-judicial tribunal, be jurisdictional: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. However, it is to be noted that the errors of law there identified as having that effect were said to be those causing an inferior tribunal to identify the wrong issue. It may be doubted whether an error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could ever have that effect for reasons explained in Yusuf ."
cited,McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639,"ASIC also sought an order that the costs be paid forthwith: O 62 r3(3) of the Federal Court Rules . In support of its application, ASIC referred to the fact that additional costs had been incurred in making arrangements for Mr Blackburn to give his evidence from Peru. The principles which govern the exercise of the discretion under O 62 r 3 were set out by Branson J in Life Airbag Company of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Company (New Zealand) Ltd (22 May 1998, unreported) and Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No.14) (Lindgren J, 18 August 1995, unreported) as cited in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13] [20]. The effect of those cases is to suggest that courts will depart from the general rule and order payment forthwith principally where final judgment is ""far away"" and thus the eventuality of payment is remote. Consistent with those authorities, it is inappropriate in this case to order payment forthwith of the costs thrown away. The trial is now set for September, and final resolution of the proceeding is therefore not too far away. Moreover, the costs incurred were not quantified and the plaintiff is ASIC, a government entity with sufficient funding to meet its costs in the interim. 25 Accordingly, I will order that MPG pay ASIC's costs thrown away but make no order for immediate payment or taxation.

Indeed the rights of the proposed party have not yet come into existence. What is proposed, however, is that the rights of the new trustee will substitute for the rights of the existing trustee, which do extend back to the date on which proceedings were commenced. 45 A new trustee may by registered deed be appointed in place of a trustee (s 6(1) Trustee Act 1925 (NSW) (' Trustee Act ')). Section 6(8) provides that a new trustee appointed under this section may in all respects act as if the new trustee had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument creating the trust. Errol Investments submits that this is reflected in O 6 r 11(2) which should therefore be applied."
distinguished,"Kear v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] 1087 FCA","In summary, the applicant submits that the AAT misapplied the term ""own use or benefit"" within the context of s 8(1). In particular: &#8226; The phrase does not call for an assessment as to whether a person can in fact use the earnings as they wish or benefit from the earnings in an absolute sense. &#8226; The fact that the money may be earmarked to meet a particular obligation does not detract from the fact that the money is for the person's own use or benefit: Kear v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] 1087 FCA. &#8226; The fact that the repayments were made in respect of tasks performed by the respondent and made to the same entity who paid her wages seems to have clouded the issue. The situation is analogous to an employee who is found liable to the employer for damages for negligence arising out of the employee's actions in the workplace: even if the damages awarded were deducted from wages of the employee it could not be said that the employee's earnings were the lesser sum after the deduction of the damages award. &#8226; The circumstances surrounding the payment by the respondent and later reimbursement of $1,300 highlights the error in the AAT's approach. &#8226; The AAT appears to have been influenced by the fact that the applicant was unable to identify a benefit to the respondent from the amounts of the shortfalls. This is clearly an irrelevant consideration as the Act provides for the alternative of ""use or benefit"". The respondent in this case clearly used the amounts to meet her obligations. In any event the respondent did benefit from such amounts in that her superannuation entitlements were calculated on the basis of her gross earnings without deduction for the shortfalls as was apparent from the Employee Payment Summary provided by her employer. 14 In summary, the respondent submitted: 1. So-called questions of law 1, 5 and 6 specified in the notice of appeal are not, in fact, questions of law. 2. The AAT correctly recognised that the key question is whether the whole of the respondent's nominal gross wages can be said to be ""income"" as that term is defined for the purposes of s 8 of the Act . Expressed alternatively, could the amount of the withheld shortfall be said to be earned, derived or received by her for her own use or benefit? 3. The phrase ""for the person's own use or benefit"" entails the notion of a person being able to use property or income as the person wishes or sees fit, as opposed to being obliged to apply the property or income in a particular way. The respondent was never able, at the time of earning, derivation or (constructive) receipt to use the whole of her nominal gross wage as she wished or saw fit. Rather, to the extent of any shortfall, her employer was contractually entitled to withhold the amount of that shortfall from that gross wage and the respondent was obliged to accept that such an amount could be so withheld. 4. The words ""without any reduction"" which appear in s 1072 of the Act qualify only ""income"" as defined, namely the income earned, derived or received for the person's own use or benefit . 5. Reference by the applicant to the sum of $1,300 later received by the respondent by way of refund from her employer is a distraction as the appeal is unconcerned with that sum, although it will be relevant in any recalculation by the applicant of the amount, if any, of any overpayment of benefit. In any event, the AAT correctly regarded that sum as ""ordinary income"" for the purposes of the Act . 15 Appeals from the AAT are not appeals in the strict sense as they lie within the original jurisdiction of the Court. A party to a proceeding before the AAT may appeal to the Court from any decision of the AAT in that proceeding, but only on questions of law: s 44(1) Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). 47 It is for the same reason that I find distinguishable from these facts the decision in Kear [1998] 1087 FCA where Heerey J held that the relevant money received by the applicant in that case was ""his own money to deal with as he saw fit"" notwithstanding that the applicant had other commitments or arrangements for which that money was earmarked."
cited,McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134,"Full Federal Court in McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134 at 143 (Hill, Sundberg and Stone JJ) summarised the principles applicable to the construction of DTAs in this way: Double tax treaties are bilateral treaties entered into between two states. As such they are to be interpreted in accordance with the requirements of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (23 May 1969, entered into force on 22 January 1974) (the Convention) and in particular Art 31 of the Convention. The application of the Convention has been discussed by McHugh J in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 and in Thiel v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1990] HCA 37 ; (1990) 171 CLR 338 , the latter case being concerned with the interpretation of the double taxation agreement between Australia and Switzerland. The leading authority in this Court on interpretation of double taxation agreements is [ Commissioner of Taxation v Lamesa Holdings BV (1997) 77 FCR 597]. It is unnecessary here, to set out again what is there said. The following principles can be said to be applicable: Regard should be had to the ""four corners of the actual text"". The text must be given primacy in the interpretation process. The ordinary meaning of the words used are presumed to be ""the authentic representation of the parties' intentions"": Applicant A . The courts must, however, in addition to having regard to the text, have regard as well to the context, object and purpose of the treaty provisions. The approach to interpretation involves a holistic approach. International agreements should be interpreted ""liberally"". Treaties often fail to demonstrate the precision of domestic legislation and should thus not be applied with ""taut logical precision""."
referred to,Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 69 ALR 305,"First, it is not a matter of focusing only on the last job the veteran had, or indeed on any particular job; rather, the phrase 'remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking' refers to the type of work the veteran was undertaking or his field of remunerative activity: Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 69 ALR 305 at 402; Starcevich v Repatriation Commission (1987) 18 FCR 221 at 225 per Fox J; Doig v Repatriation Commission (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Lindgren J, 18 December 1996); Flentjar v Repatriation Commission (supra) at 4. 39 In view of the last point, some general matters about the scope and operation of s 24(1)(c) should be noted. First, under s 24(1)(c), the veteran must, by reason of the incapacity from the war-caused injuries alone, be prevented from continuing to undertake remunerative work. It is clear from the authorities that other words should not be substituted for the word 'alone', and the issue is to be approached in a practical, common-sense, fashion. In Cavell v Repatriation Commission (1988) 9 AAR 534, Burchett J said (at 538-539): 'I was referred to the Tribunal decision of Davies J, then President of the Tribunal, in Re Easton and Repatriation Commission (1987) 6 AAR 558 at 570-571. Davies J there cited passages from Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 6 AAR 113, Lucas v Repatriation Commission (1986) 6 AAR 122, and Re Apthorpe and Repatriation Commission (1986) 9 ALN N157, a Tribunal decision, each of which emphasises that what must prevent the veteran from continuing to undertake remunerative work, in order to satisfy par (c), must be the war-related incapacity, and that incapacity alone. As was pointed out in Lucas 's case (supra), that means it must be relevant to determine whether the applicant would, in any event, have been debarred from work because of a factor such as age. But Davies J went on to say: ""I would not, however, substitute for the word ""alone"" the description ""sole, unique and absolute cause"" as stated in Re Repatriation Commission and Cavell (unreported, No 2891, 19 September 1986) ... . In the absence of ambiguity, other words should not be used in place of the words used by the legislation."" With respect, I entirely concur in the comment made by Davies J. This is not to say, of course, that a paraphrase may not throw light into a dark corner of a statutory prescription. But the phrase used by the Tribunal to which objection is taken, involves an almost scholastic insistence upon analysis of the concept of singularity. The tendency of that is to distract the Tribunal from its true task to make a practical decision whether the veteran's loss of remunerative work is attributable to his service-related incapacities, and not to something else as well. It is a decision that should not be made upon nice philosophical distinctions, but with an eye to reality, and as a matter in respect of which common sense is the proper guide.'"

referred to,George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104,"The phrase ""reasonable grounds to believe"" (or variants of it) has a well understood and well settled meaning. In George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112 the High Court said that: ""When a statute prescribes that there must be ""reasonable grounds"" for a state of mind including suspicion and belief it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person."" Later in its joint judgment the Court continued (at 116): ""The objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly to the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of belief is given on more slender evidence than proof. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture."""
cited,Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 8 ATPR 40-748,"The power of the Court to make orders for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

applied,Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394,"On 30 March 2006, Haritopoulos Pty Ltd also issued proceedings under s 39B of the Judiciary Act in this Court (matter SAD 54 of 2006) against the respondent for orders that certain notices of assessment of income tax against it were invalid as not having been made in good faith and having been made for an improper purpose. In particular, Haritopoulos challenged the validity of an assessment issued on 8 November 2005 in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2002 by which Haritopoulos was assessed for income tax liability at $2,813,000 (plus certain other amounts to which I do not need to refer), and the validity of an assessment issued on 24 November 2005 imposing a penalty assessment of $2,109,750. On 25 May 2006, the respondent applied to summarily dismiss that application. The motion was heard on 29 August 2006. Judgment was given on 23 March 2007. Justice Besanko found that, on the material before the Court, Haritopoulos had no arguable case that the assessment challenged was made in bad faith and entered summary judgment dismissing the proceeding in its entirety: Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394. 13 In each of the proceedings heard by Finn J and Besanko J, the nature of the allegations is very similar to those now asserted in the statement of claim filed on behalf of the applicant in this matter. 14 Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that, unless the applicant is given leave to amend its statement of claim to add what is called a new issue, and to rely on an affidavit of Pantelis Charitopoulos sworn on 29 May 2007 in opposition to the motion, the Court would on the motion make an order dismissing the application because the issues raised on the present statement of claim are in essence the same as those already addressed. 19 Taking facts alleged in the present statement of claim at their highest, the issues which might point to invalidity of the assessment and of the penalty assessment are the same as those which Besanko J addressed in Haritopoulos [2007] FCA 394. They are a failure to provide particulars of the assessment and of the penalty assessment; secondly, the issue of the assessment on 15 September 2005 when, a few weeks earlier, an officer of the respondent had anticipated that it would take six to eight weeks for a default assessment to issue; thirdly, the fact that the penalty assessment was issued so close in time to the assessment; and finally, the failure to consider the package of information provided on 3 November 2005 before making the assessment (although it is clear that there was no undertaking given to consider that material before making the assessment, and in fact it was made plain on 20 October 2005 and in the letter of 8 November 2005 that a default assessment would issue notwithstanding the provision of that further information). 20 I agree with Besanko J, for the reasons his Honour gave, that on those allegations no arguable case of bad faith on the part of the respondent in making the assessment or the penalty assessment could be made out. As so much has been acknowledged by counsel for the applicant, I do not need to repeat those reasons. Furthermore, although it has not been expressly stated in this application, I note that Besanko J also rejected the further contention that arguably there had been a breach of s 166 of the 1936 Act and in any event his Honour found it beyond argument that s 175 meant that any such breach would not affect the validity of the assessment. His Honour also noted (as appears also to be the case here) that the claim based upon a want of procedural fairness had not been pursued before him, and in any event it was unarguable as ss 175 and 177 would operate so as not to affect the validity of the assessment even if there had been a want of procedural fairness to which the applicant was entitled. In the light of those provisions, Besanko J concluded, and I agree, that the applicant was bound to confine its challenge (as distinct from any challenge to the amount of the assessment under Pt IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth)) to the ""Hickman grounds"" ( R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox and Clinton [1945] HCA 53 ; (1945) 70 CLR 598 per Dixon J at 615), relevantly that the assessment was not made in good faith."

His Lordship distinguished this from the case of a profit-earning ship where the plaintiff had to prove '... the probability that she would have earned so much money if her owner could have used her' ([1961] AC at 577). With a nonprofit-earning ship, if no harm were proved apart from the mere fact that the owner is deprived of her services during the period of repairs, the Court awards damages based on interest and depreciation on the value of the ship ([1961] AC at 578 per Lord Reid, 580 per Lords Morton of Henryton and Tucker, 583 per Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest; The Greta Holme [1897] AC 596).

However, even if the Tribunal had relied on the prevalence of document fraud in Bangladesh it would fall within the exception of s 424A(3)(a) of the Act . His Honour found that there was no statutory obligation of the Tribunal to provide an opportunity to the applicant to comment on the these adverse findings of the Tribunal, as such adverse findings are not ""information"" for the purposes of s 424A ( SZEEU v MIMIA [2006] FCAFC 2 at [20] , [28]). 13 In relation to the claims of a denial of procedural fairness at common law, Nicholls FM noted that the Tribunal in its decision said it had alerted the applicant to country information as to the prevalence of document fraud in Bangladesh. Similarly, the Tribunal had drawn attention to the fact that it could give not weight to the documents because of the adverse view it had taken of the appellant's credibility. In the absence of evidence provided by the applicant, the Court was unable to accept a submission of the applicant challenging these statements of the Tribunal. 14 In response to the claims of the appellant at the hearing that he was a politician, not a dentist, and that he was denied another hearing to prove this, Nicholls FM found that the applicant's request for another hearing was in response to the letter of the Tribunal and must be seen in that context. The Tribunal complied with its statutory obligations under s 425 of the Act . To the extent that natural justice in the context of Tribunal hearings is addressed exhaustively in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Act , any complaint of a denial of natural justice at common law could not succeed. However even if s 422B did not operate, the Federal Magistrate asserted such a claim still would not succeed in these circumstances."
cited,SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886,"Only where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so will leave be granted to argue a ground of appeal abandoned in a lower court: see O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at [319] ; Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at [7] . In NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [163] Madgwick J adopted the approach taken by Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [48] where their Honours said: 'The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where however there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused.' This principle has been followed more recently in SZFIR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 424 and SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886. 21 Thirdly, the particular circumstances of this case are such that refusal to grant leave may lead to serious consequences for an appellant seeking asylum as considered in Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543 at 548 and in SZEPN [2006] FCA 886 [16]. 22 The merits of the proposed ground of appeal is also a significant consideration in determining whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice to grant leave: see SZEPN [2006] FCA 886 [17] per Branson J; VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [177] - [178] ; IYER [2000] FCA 1788 per Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ at [22]-[24]; and Gomez 190 ALR at [548]. In SZCIJ [2006] FCAFC 62 the Full Court refused to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal for two reasons, one reason being that the appellant disavowed the ground sought to be raised in the Federal Magistrates Court. However the more fundamental reason was that leave to amend would be futile since the ground sought to be relied upon lacked merit."
followed,O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1680,"The power to order costs, conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), is a discretionary power.

referred to,Australian Federal Police Commissioner v Propend Finance Pty Ltd (1997) 188 CLR,"The privilege asserted is legal advice privilege, which protects confidential communications between a client and his or her legal adviser. The protection of communications passing between third parties and the client's legal adviser does not arise in the present case: all the documents in question are said to be communications created by the OWS or Mr Ronson as State Manager of the OWS (the client) and communicated to the Legal and Advice Branch (the legal adviser). The relevant communications in respect of which privilege is claimed are all contained in documents. Therefore, in determining whether the communications enjoy the privilege claimed, the relevant test to be applied in each case is whether the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49. Although no submissions were put directly on the point, it appears from the applicant's list of documents that several of the documents may be copies of documents which, in their original form, are not the subject of privilege. Whether these copy documents enjoy legal professional privilege will depend upon whether the copy was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice: Australian Federal Police Commissioner v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501."
cited,AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234,"It is well recognised that a claim of legal professional privilege will not be upheld if the party resisting the claim for legal professional privilege can show reasonable grounds for believing that the communication effected by the document for which privilege is claimed was made for an illegal or improper purpose: Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501; Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500; and see generally AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [211] - [219] . This does not require a demonstration that the legal advisers were themselves conscious participants in fulfilling the improper purpose: Yunghanns v Elfic Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 113 ; (2000) 1 VR 92 at 106. While it is not sufficient merely to allege improper purpose, it is not necessary fully to prove the allegations.

In Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 the Full Court of this Court held, after it had identified the relevant considerations to the exercise of the power in s 501(2), that the section did not infringe or contravene Chapter III of the Constitution .

considered,Re Ruddock (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) and Another; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437,"The submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner were to the following effect: (1) There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal for the following reasons: (a) It was squarely put to Mrs Montgomery who had reconstructed the Price Spreadsheets that she had 'fabricated' or 'massaged' or 'fiddled' the figures in the Price Spreadsheets. (b) The Tribunal in reviewing a decision is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence and must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case. In those circumstances, the rule in Browne v Dunn has no application. (c) The Tribunal was entitled to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions where it was obvious that information had been omitted or falsely inserted, in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn. (d) In relation to one subject matter, 3D was invited by the Tribunal during closing submissions to re-open its case and call further evidence. It was clearly open to 3D to seek leave to recall Mrs Montgomery in order to overcome any perceived deficiency in the opportunity she had been afforded, when first cross-examined, to explain discrepancies in the relevant documents. 3D did not seek such leave. The substance of the fabrication was put to Mrs Montgomery (2) 3D has submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness because it is alleged the specific detail of the Commissioner's analysis of the Price Spreadsheets, which forms Annexure A to the Tribunal's reasons for decision, was not put to Mrs Montgomery. The Tribunal referred to this submission but found it to be without substance. (3) From the commencement of the audit and in the hearing before the Tribunal, the Commissioner had directly challenged the story put forward as to the existence of MSH and Mr Borg. It was manifest that any documentation put forward by the taxpayer in support of that story was also under challenge. (4) The Commissioner's challenge to the Price Spreadsheets was also fully appreciated by 3D. So much is clear from paras 14 and 15 of the Submissions of the Applicant dated 1 June 2007 which were provided to the Tribunal before the Commissioner made the submissions of which 3D presently complains. (5) It is significant that notwithstanding the opportunity to do so in submissions in reply, 3D made no submissions about the fabrications in the Price Spreadsheets, but merely confined its complaint to what was said to be a denial of procedural fairness. Indeed, 3D could not possibly have had an answer to the fabrications, which were apparent on the face of the Price Spreadsheets when they were compared with the Job Balance record. (6) In any event, an evaluation of the Price Spreadsheets was not necessary to the Tribunal's decision. Once it found that Mr Borg did not exist, the 'elaborate arrangements alleged as to how he ... was paid may be of limited relevance.' For that reason, the Tribunal took the view that the submissions made by the Commissioner concerning the Price Spreadsheets were of 'peripheral relevance'. (7) It is clear that an immaterial error of law will not vitiate the decision of the Tribunal. Even though it was perhaps not necessary to do so once it found that Mr Borg did not exist, the Tribunal for the sake of completeness annexed the Commissioner's analysis of the Price Spreadsheets to its reasons, and held that it correctly summarised the evidence given in this regard. (8) The evidence showed that Mrs Montgomery, having prepared the Price Spreadsheets, was the person who was most familiar with those documents and may be taken to have intimately known the content of them. She must also be taken to have been aware that the figures in those documents had been manipulated in order to reach the totals on the cheques (as the Commissioner has demonstrated in Annexure A to the Tribunal's reasons). (9) It was also an incontrovertible fact that Mrs Montgomery had also managed to create a Price Spreadsheet in respect of items which proved not to be for hire at all but for sale, demonstrating the fact of its fabrication. Mrs Montgomery was cross-examined about this and it was directly put to her in the following terms: 'Really, Ms Montgomery, what this shows is that your documents at tab 14 are a fabrication, aren't they?---No, they're not. They came out of the computer program. You have told us that the starting point of one of them, the first one behind tab 14 for the week ending 28 December, is a real document from the time, haven't you?---That's right. It's nothing of the kind, is it?---Yes, it is. It's something that you have put together to try to substantiate numbers?---No. I took it out of off the job balance generals. And then you have told us that you have extrapolated back, and, lo and behold, you have been able to extrapolate for the week ending 7 December by adding and subtracting advices and receipts to page 427, a number of 16,500, which you purport would explain another entry in the bank statements and on Mr Borg's statements of account?---These were all these all came out of the computer program. These, being tab 14?---These were all worked out of the computer program. They have been massaged the numbers have been massaged and fiddled with---?---No. ---and put together by you---' (10) Clearly Mrs Montgomery, as the author of the recreated Price Spreadsheets, was only too aware of what the cross-examiner was putting to her when he suggested that she had massaged and fiddled the numbers. If there was an answer to be made by her, 3D was on notice of the need to elicit that explanation in re-examination or by seeking leave to adduce further evidence in chief. Application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn (11) Section 33(1)(b) of the AAT Act stipulates that a proceeding before the Tribunal shall be conducted with as little formality and technicality as the legislation and a proper consideration of the matters permits. Consistent with that legislative approach, s 33(1)(c) provides that the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence. (12) 3D, before the Tribunal, had suggested that there was a 'clear breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn '. In Re Ruddock (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) and Another; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 , the High Court held that the rule in Browne v Dunn had no application to proceedings before the Refugee Review Tribunal. Section 420(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (an equivalent provision to s 33 of the AAT Act) was relevant to that conclusion. The High Court held that the purpose of such provisions was to free bodies such as the Tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law. (13) In any event, even assuming the rule was to apply, there was no breach of that rule. Where it is obvious that the evidence of the witness is challenged, failure to state this expressly will not necessarily involve a breach of the rule. (14) In Jagelman v Commissioner of Taxation 96 ATC 4055 , it was submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness by reason of a failure to put a matter to the applicant. Justice Hill observed at 4060: 'However, it has been pointed out in a number of cases that the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn must depend upon the circumstances of the case. Where the issues in a case are such that it would readily be apparent to a party that a particular imputation has been made, there will be no necessity to put that imputation to a witness who denies it and, in consequence, there will have been no denial of procedural fairness: see Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (unreported, Court of Appeal, NSW, 3 June 1977) discussed by Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 21-2. In the latter case, Hunt J said (at 23): ""In many cases, of course, counsel for the party calling the witness in question will be alert to the relevance of the other material in the case to be relied upon for the challenge to the truth of the evidence given by his witness or to the credit of that witness, and in those circumstances counsel will be able to give his witness the opportunity to deal with that other material in his own evidence in chief.""' It was open to the Tribunal to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions (15) Section 43 of the AAT Act provides that the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred on the decision-maker and stands in the shoes of the Commissioner. The Tribunal is not bound by the facts that were before the decision-maker. (16) The Price Spreadsheets and the Job Balance General were 3D's documents and their inherent want of authenticity could be gathered directly from them. 3D's written submissions in chief to the Tribunal invited consideration of the content of the documents, independent of any testimony about them from which 3D asserted that their authenticity was self-evident. The Commissioner was entitled to (and did) respond on the same basis. It was open to the Tribunal to draw the conclusions which the Commissioner invited, simply by looking at the documents. In particular, that there had been manipulation of those documents by either omitting or falsely inserting information in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn. Opportunity to Re-open (17) Section 39 of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case. This section is a statutory recognition of the requirement to afford natural justice. Section 33(1)(c) has been held to permit the introduction of further evidence after the conclusion of the hearing. That requirement may extend to permitting a party to adduce new evidence once judgement has been reserved. It has been held that while normally a court will require exceptional circumstances to permit that course, so stringent a test does not apply in AAT hearings. (18) In Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 , a party was afforded an opportunity by the Tribunal to call further evidence. Justice Deane said as follows: 'In the context of the express invitation to the appellant, at the conclusion of the evidence, to adduce any further evidence or other material and of the complete absence of any indication by the appellant that he was under any misapprehension or that he desired that the proceedings be adjourned, the failure of the Tribunal either to adjourn the proceedings of its own motion or expressly to inform the appellant of his right to seek an adjournment did not, in my view, constitute a failure to ensure that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity of putting his case or otherwise involve a failure to observe the requirements of natural justice.' (19) After the conclusion of the evidence and during the course of 3D's submissions below, the Tribunal indicated that it would afford 3D an opportunity to reopen its case if Mr Borg could be found. The Tribunal later repeated this invitation a number of times, that 3D should 'go and find Mr Borg', for the reason that he was 'either crucial or important in this equation'. (20) 3D acknowledged that it was open to it to re-open its case. It was open to 3D to have recalled Mrs Montgomery or any other witness it thought could shed light on the figures in the Price Spreadsheets, the authenticity of which the Commissioner had challenged, first in cross-examination of Mrs Montgomery and subsequently in written submissions. It did not do so for the obvious reason that there was no possible explanation for the discrepancies identified by the Commissioner, other than that the figures had been manipulated or fabricated. (21) The Tribunal amply accorded natural justice in the present case by extending an opportunity to 3D to call further evidence and by providing a further opportunity to be heard. Thereafter, any potential lack of procedural fairness arising from the level of detail of the original cross-examination (the Commissioner does not accept that there was any) was averted. 3D did not avail itself of the opportunity. 18 Despite the provisions of subs 33(1) of the AAT Act, I am not persuaded that everything that was said by Gummow and Heydon JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) in Applicant S154/2002 concerning the non-applicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn to proceedings in the Refugee Review Tribunal can be transported, so to speak, to proceedings in the Tribunal. At [55] and [56], their Honours said: '[55] On occasion the submissions advanced for the prosecutrix were couched in the language of a contention that the rule in Browne v Dunn had not been complied with. Where a complaint is made about the failure of a questioner to put to a person giving oral answers a particular question, it is natural for a lawyer's mind to turn to the rule in Browne v Dunn. In essence, and subject to numerous qualifications and exceptions, that rule requires the cross-examiner of a witness in adversarial litigation to put to that witness the nature of the case on which the cross-examiner's client proposes to rely in contradiction of that witness. [56] However, the rule has no application to proceedings in the tribunal. Section 420(2) of the Act states: The Tribunal, in reviewing a decision: (a) is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and (b) must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case. The purpose of a provision such as s 420(2) is to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law which the legislature regards as inappropriate. Further, as was emphasised in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; [(1996) 185 CLR 259 at 282], administrative decision-making is of a different nature from decisions to be made on civil litigation conducted under common law procedures. There, the court has to decide where, on the balance of probabilities, the truth lies as between the evidence the parties to the litigation have considered it in their respective interests to adduce at trial.'"
applied,General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125,"The BoQ parties have applied, pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules , to strike out those paragraphs of the amended defence identified in the notice of motion by which the application was brought. They expressly eschew reliance upon s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). That means that the application falls for determination having regard to the circumspection in relation to the striking out of a pleading counselled by authorities such as General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. 6 In the substantive proceeding the case advanced by the BoQ parties may be summarised as follows: (a) each of the OMB parties who entered into an OMB Agreement was an ""independent contractor""; (b) each respective OMB Agreement related to the performance of work by that party as an independent contractor; (c) there exists in each respective case the requisite constitutional connection specified in s 5(2) of the Independent Contractors Act 2006 (Cth); (d) accordingly, each respective OMB Agreement is a ""services contract"" as defined by s 5(1) of the Independent Contractors Act ; (e) s 106 of the NSW Act is a law of a State which expressly provides for a court to make an order or determination in relation to a ""services contract"" on an unfairness ground setting aside, declaring void or amending or varying that contract; (f) the effect of s 7(1)(c) of the Independent Contractors Act and s 109 of the Constitution is that the OMB Agreements are not affected by s 106 of the NSW Act; (g) accordingly, the Industrial Court of New South Wales has no jurisdiction to make an order under s 106 of the NSW Act in respect of the OMB Agreements. 20 Well over a century ago, in Daly v Egan (1886) 12 VLR 81 , at 84, a Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria observed of the jurisdiction to give summary judgment that: This summary jurisdiction is not intended to be exercised where the defendant has any plausible defence, or disputes any of the material facts. A Judge in chambers is not to try a case on affidavit where the facts are in dispute. See also to like effect in that same year observations made by Holroyd J in White v Johnston (1886) 8 ALT 53. Thus, when in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 105 , at 129-130 Barwick CJ cited with approval the following observation of Dixon J (as he then was) in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 , at 91 that: The fact that a transaction is intricate may not disentitle the court to examine a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the proceeding amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious, But once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process, he was not promoting any novel approach to the disposal of an application like the present. The approach described had been evident since colonial times. Real questions of law and fact are raised by para 52(c) and paras 57 to 63 of the amended defence. It is not appropriate to deal with them summarily. Further, that there are presently hypothetical qualities to the questions of law sought to be agitated by the BoQ parties is an added reason, in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, for this Court not to answer them at this stage. The courts created by the Commonwealth Parliament under Chapter III of the Constitution do not give advisory opinions: In Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257."
discussed,Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525,"The Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the proceedings before Buddin J could be described as having resulted in a conviction for a criminal offence. It referred to a number of authorities to which I will have to refer in due course, including Attorney General (NSW) v Whiley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314; Whitham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 and Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Pty Limited [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98. The Tribunal concluded that there was no doubt that proceedings before Buddin J had been brought with the purpose of punishing Mr Seymour noting that it had been common ground, as Buddin J recorded in his reasons, that the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applied and that the penalty imposed had been one of imprisonment for a fixed term, as opposed to an indefinite term until the contempt of being purged. The tribunal then said: '24. Therefore whilst not free from doubt, I accept for current purposes that the contempt proceedings before Buddin J were criminal. 25. The result of that finding has application to both subparagraphs 5.2 and 5.4 of the Respondent's Statement of Facts and Contentions.' 31 Mr Seymour relied upon the statement that all proceedings for contempt ' must realistically be seen as criminal in nature ' as Deane J pointed out in Hinch v Attorney General (Vict) [1987] HCA 56 ; (1987) 164 CLR 15 at 49 and as approved by Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534. It was said that, accordingly, the tribunal's finding that the contempt charge determined by Buddin J was criminal was an error of law. Next he argued that that error of law affected the tribunal's finding that Mr Seymour demonstrated a lack of candour and openness by his apparently contradictory stances taken before the Court of Appeal in the earlier contempt proceedings (namely that the Law Society should not be allowed to appeal against his acquittal) and his stance in the proceedings before the tribunal (that the proceedings before Buddin J were not criminal). 34 The Authority submitted that the tribunal was correct to classify the proceedings before Buddin J as having involved a conviction of a criminal offence by reference to the character of the jurisdiction invoked under Pt 55 rr 7 and 13 of the Supreme Court Rules , the fact that the proceedings were to seek the punishment by imprisonment of Mr Seymour and the nature of the inherent jurisdiction to punish for contempt. The Authority submitted that the character of the contempt charged before Buddin J was that of disobedience, in the sense of a defiance of the authority of the Supreme Court and that there was a public injury occasioned by such defiance. It was said that, the purpose of the proceedings was to maintain the integrity of the judicial process, to advance the public interest to vindicate judicial authority or to maintain the integrity of the judicial process, relying on that class of contempt as being within a class of criminal contempt as explained in Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR at 531. 73 In Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 all justices considered the historical classification of contempts as 'civil' and 'criminal' to be unsatisfactory. Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ described the differences upon which the distinction of classification is based as being in many respects 'illusory' (183 CLR at 534) while McHugh J said the case for abolishing the distinction 'is a strong one' (183 CLR at 549). 75 The reliance on the distinction in a case like the present, where the applicant was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, suspended, for breaching a court order shows how unworkable the distinction really is in practice. Was the contempt with which the applicant was charged civil when the charge was preferred? Did it remain so or did it transmute, as the seriousness of, and contumaciousness of, his conduct was proved in evidence or found by Buddin J when giving judgment? The very notion that an allegation of contempt can have such a chameleon-like character demonstrated, in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 108-109 and in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525, that all such cases had to be decided on the criminal standard of proof. The High Court did not have to decide in the latter case whether the distinction between 'civil' and 'criminal' contempt should be abolished (see 183 CLR at 549). 76 In Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534, Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that because of the illusory nature of the differences said to exist between the 'civil' and 'criminal' classes of contempt and the fact that the usual outcome of all such proceedings is punishment, all proceedings for contempt must realistically be seen as criminal in nature. 77 That does not result in all contempt proceedings themselves being now seen to be for a criminal offence. Indeed, their Honours went on to say (183 CLR at 534): 'However, to say that proceedings for contempt are essentially criminal in nature is not to equate them with the trial of a criminal charge. There are clear procedural differences, the most obvious being that criminal charges ordinarily involve trial by jury, whereas charges of contempt do not. There is no basis, in our view, for importing into the law of contempt the nineteenth century rules which allowed a verdict of guilty, given in a jury trial, to be quashed on appeal, but did not permit of an order for retrial. Moreover, the issue, so far as contempt is concerned, is not whether there should be a retrial, but whether there should be a rehearing.' 84 The elusiveness of the distinction Windeyer J identified is demonstrated by the result in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525. There the question was what standard of proof applied, i.e. civil or criminal, in proceedings which fell squarely within Lord Atkinson's 'civil' classification, namely, charges of contempt that the appellant knowingly or recklessly presented a false or misleading statement of his assets and liabilities in an affidavit which he had been ordered to make and that he breached (what was then termed) a Mareva injunction, (this is now known as a Mareva order: Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 393-394 [25] [-26]) by dealing with his assets contrary to the terms. Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (183 CLR at 533-534): 'Given that purpose or object cannot readily be disentangled from effect and given, also, that a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction may be called into play in proceedings alleging breach of an order or undertaking, it is necessary to acknowledge, as it was in Mudginberri ((1986) [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 108), that punitive and remedial objects are, in the words of Salmon LJ ""inextricably intermixed"" ( Jennison v Baker [1972] 2 QB 52 at 64). Moreover and, perhaps, of more importance, nothing is achieved by describing some proceedings as "" punitive "" and others as "" remedial or coercive "". Punishment is punishment, whether it is imposed in vindication or for remedial or coercive purposes. And there can be no doubt that imprisonment and the imposition of fines, the usual sanctions for contempt, constitute punishment. And the same is true of a sequestration made in consequence of a company's failure to comply with an order or undertaking.' 98 When the High Court held in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534 that all contempts are criminal in nature and must be proved on the criminal standard, it ensured that the alleged contemnor was afforded the safeguards given at common law to all accuseds. The Court also recognized that the historical classification of 'civil' and 'criminal' contempt is unsatisfactory. 104 Accordingly, I must decide whether Mr Seymour was found by Buddin J to have acted contumaciously in breach of the injunction. A 'civil' contempt can become 'criminal' where the act charged is contumacious in the sense that in doing it there was a direct intention to disobey the order ( Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 541 per McHugh J citing Warrington J's well known dictum in Stancomb v Trowbridge Urban Council [1910] 2 Ch 190 at 194). A breach of an injunction or undertaking to the Court can also be criminal if it is '... an obstinate disregard' of the obligation imposed by or owed to the Court ( Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 111-112). The hallmark of a classification of 'criminal' contempt of this nature is contumacy or defiance ( Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 489 per Barwick CJ, 501-502 per Windeyer J; Doyle v The Commonwealth [1985] HCA 46 ; (1986) 156 CLR 510 at 516)."

considered,Minister for Immigration v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77,"The evidence before the Federal Magistrates Court was that on 11 March 1999 the Tribunal sent a letter to the applicant at his address notifying him of the Tribunal's decision to affirm the decision of the delegate which enclosed a copy of the Tribunal's decisions and reasons. The letter informed the applicant that he had 28 days within which to appeal to the Federal Court. It noted that if the letter were posted he would be taken to have received it seven days after the date of the letter. (Presumably this was in reliance upon reg 5.03 of the Migration Regulations which so provided. However, in Minister for Immigration v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77 at 91 [51] O'Connor and Mansfield JJ held that regulation to be invalid to the extent it sought to impose such time constraints.) 23 Regulation 5.03 made provision for deeming a document to be served 7 days after its date. It also permitted the document to be sent on the seventh day so that, in fact, it could not have been received until after the seventh day. A Full Court of this Court held that Regulation 5.03 was ultra vires the regulation making power ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77)."
discussed,One.Tel Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548,"A court should not engage upon a determination of the merits of the case where the only outstanding claim is as to costs. See Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 and One.Tel Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 at 552-553. Those cases also demonstrate that a court may inquire as to the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties to ascertain whether or not orders for costs should be made. Those cases would have no point if it were open to a party to ask the court to make a judgment in the very general form suggested by counsel. That in the present actions against Giant Marine, the Adsteam payments have disposed of all issues other than costs appears from the decision of the High Court in Baxter v Obacelo Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 66 ; (2001) 205 CLR 635 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at [38], [39], [40], [43], [46] and [47] and per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [55] and [56]. In particular it should be noted that Gummow and Hayne JJ approved the statement of ""general principle"" contained in the passage cited at [56] from the judgment of Auld LJ in Jameson v Central Electricity Generating Board [1998] QB 323. That general principle is: Where accord and satisfaction cannot be relied upon, as where a claimant settles with only one of two concurrent tortfeasors, the tortfeasor facing a claim will nevertheless have a defence if the plaintiff's settlement with the other has fully compensated him for the separate wrongs done to him. 18 Finally, the plaintiffs seek to distinguish Lai Qin and One.Tel upon the basis that they presently ask for summary judgment or judgment on admissions and not a trial. I see no merit in that argument. In preparing for such an application costs will be incurred by both sides. In some cases those costs may be relatively insignificant. In others they may be substantial. The policy considerations supporting the decisions to which I have referred are as relevant to these applications as they are to trials. 20 The plaintiffs submit that if they are not entitled to summary judgment they are nonetheless entitled, in claiming costs, to seek to demonstrate that they would probably have won had the actions gone to judgment. They rely on the same matters as they rely upon in connection with the summary judgment application plus some aspects of the evidence filed in anticipation of a trial. Their position seems to be that Giant Marine ought to have responded to that evidence, and that its failure to do so demonstrates that their evidence ought to be accepted. There is an incongruity between such an approach and the decisions in Lai Qin and One.Tel to which I have previously referred. If the parties are to call and cross-examine witnesses, then the process starts to look very much like a trial on the merits for the sole purpose of deciding questions of costs. The plaintiffs' approach also ignores the possibility that even in the absence of contrary evidence, their evidence may have been discredited in cross-examination."

cited,Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679,"referred to cl 10 at [18] above. Clause 10 was as follows: The Licensor or their agent shall sell the seed or product delivered to it by the grower (or otherwise subject to this agreement) via the payment schedule as per attachment. Clause 10 appears to be a promise by AAC to ICM that AAC or Namoi will sell seed and product delivered to ""it"" by ICM ""via the payment schedule as per attached"". It is common ground that at least the form of the Commercial Crop Contract was attached. There is a sort of payment schedule in cl 4 of the Commercial Crop Contract. That clause listed ""Guaranteed Minimum Prices"" promised to ICM as the grower. It appears that either AAC was, through its agent Namoi, a party to the Commercial Crop Contract as a principal whose existence and identity were not disclosed on the face of that document, or at least the agent Namoi entered into the Commercial Crop Contract in its own right but AAC approved of its doing so as the necessary and contemplated means of implementing the Grower's Licence. Even on the latter basis, it is arguable that AAC was bound by Mr Young's conduct on behalf of Namoi in the discussion on 29 May 2003. The date fixed for completion of the Commercial Crop Contract, 30 June 2003, was not intended to be of the essence of that contract. I mean that ICM was not entitled immediately following 30 June to terminate the contractual relationship for Namoi's failure to pay on that date. This is demonstrated by the second and last sentences of cl 3(c). The whole of cl 3(c) is as follows: Subject to normal seasonal conditions, delivery and payment under this contract is to be completed prior to 30 June 2003. If due to extraneous circumstances by either party that this contract is not completed by this date then mediation with regards to settlement terms must occur. A suggestion is that if the Grower is deemed to be at fault they would not charge the Licensor carry (storage) from this date and the credit limit in place would be renegotiated. If the Licensor is deemed to be at fault then a negotiated percentage of the balance of the products to be paid at this date. The present case concerns an assignment of a bare cause of action for unliquidated damages for breach of contract, not of a property right to which a cause of action is ancillary. The parties accepted that in these circumstances the assignment could be sustained only if Mr Young had a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment and enforcing it for his own benefit: see Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 703, which has been followed in many cases in Australia including, but not limited to, Re Timothy's Pty Ltd and the Companies Act [1981] 2 NSWLR 706; Commonwealth v Ling (1993) 44 FCR 397 ; National Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1995) 132 ALR 514 ; and see G Tolhurst, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006) at [6.59]ff . The circumstances of the present case are analogous to those in Monk in which the assignee's interest was that of obtaining a set-off against a judgment debt. In that case, Cohen J said (at 153): The plaintiff's only apparent interest is in the possibility of his becoming a creditor of the Bank. That is, his interest is in using the debt which might arise from the cause of action for his personal benefit. That no doubt is the interest of any assignee. The using of the debt as a set-off against the judgment debt is merely an example of obtaining some personal benefit. In that regard the plaintiff is in no stronger position than he would be if he had obtained an assignment of a cause of action for negligence by a customer of the Bank who claimed to have suffered injuries arising from unsafe premises. In the authorities where the Trendtex test has been applied, the commercial interest has gone beyond a mere personal interest in profiting from the outcome of the proceedings and has required an interest by the assignee in the assignor or its business affairs or activities which the assignment may in some way protect. These observations are applicable, mutatis mutandis , to the present case."
followed,Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543,"The appellant requires leave to amend his pleadings pursuant to Order 52 Rule 21(3) of the Federal Court Rules . The principles relating to a grant of such leave were considered by the Full Court of this Court in Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543 where the Court observed that ' exceptional circumstances' might exist to justify such grant. The Court said at [18]: 'The reference to ""exceptional circumstances"" indicates that there remains a discretion in the court to entertain a new ground of appeal if it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so...' 15 The function of this Court in an appeal is to review alleged errors of the Federal Magistrate and not alleged errors of the Tribunal see: Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 210 at [10] . However, since the decision in NBKT which was handed down after Emmett FM gave her decision directly impacts upon the issues to be considered in this appeal, ' exceptional circumstances ' as referred to in Gomez exist. Accordingly the Court considers that the interests of justice require that the appellant be permitted to rely upon the Amended Notice of Appeal and the Court will consider the appellant's claims as they relate to the Tribunal proceedings."

In Crosbie , Finkelstein J made an order that the directors have leave to defend the liquidator's claim against the Commissioner of Taxation on terms that they be bound by all decisions made in that action and they be treated as if parties to the action on any issue relating to costs. In Hall , Barrett J directed that the third parties have leave to appear and take part in the hearing of the plaintiffs' claims and to defend those claims: at [25]. 24 When these issues were raised, I made orders in each proceeding in the same form as those made by Finkelstein J in Crosbie . Specifically, I ordered that the third parties have leave to defend the plaintiff's claim against the Commissioner on terms that: (a) they each be bound by all decisions made in those actions; and (b) they each be treated as if parties to the action on any issue relating to costs. This order was not opposed by either the plaintiff or the Commissioner. 25 In Crosbie , Finkelstein J also expressed the view, which was not necessary to his decision, that the Court should not act on the parties' admissions as to insolvency without satisfying itself on the evidence as to the correctness of that admission. In his Honour's view, this conclusion followed from the fact that the Court can only make an order under s 588FF if it is satisfied that a transaction of a company is voidable under s 588FE. Subsequent cases have rejected this view, and held that the Court can reach the requisite satisfaction on the basis of the parties' agreement: see Wanted World Wide (Australia) Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 (' Wanted World Wide ') and Young v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 56 ACSR 654 (' Young' ). As I see it, no practical significance attaches to the issue in this case, notwithstanding the settlement reached between the plaintiff and the Commissioner, because the claims made by the plaintiff as to solvency and other matters were contested by Scott and Fairbank. However, if and to the extent that the issue has any significance for this case, I prefer, and would apply, the views expressed in Wanted World Wide and Young ."
considered,Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463,"The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts: see The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400 at [18] (' Airtourer '). As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463 at 469: 'It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs. In Pearson v. Naydler [1977] 1 W.L.R. 899, Megarry V-C said: ""The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs, however poor he is, is ancient and well-established. As Bowen L.J. said in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch. D. 34 at 38, both at law and in equity 'the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant'. The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts.""' However, as Branson J noted in Airtourer at [21]: 'Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant. An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious. An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant.'"
cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Humax Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 706,"Engaging in resale price maintenance is engaging in anti-competitive conduct, which the legislature has prohibited in the public interest. As Merkel J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Humax Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 706 ("" Humax "") at [5], engaging in resale price maintenance is a serious offence. This is apparent from the magnitude of the pecuniary penalties that corporations, and those through whom they act, may face for contravention of s 48 of the Act . 11 The consent orders proposed by the parties include: (a) declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the particular conduct in which each of the respondents engaged constituted a contravention of the Act ; (b) injunctions restraining each of the respondents from engaging in proscribed conduct for a period of three years from the date of the order; (c) orders requiring TEAC to establish an education and compliance programme for its employees; (d) an order that TEAC pay a pecuniary penalty of $175,000 in four instalments; and (e) an order that Mr Allison pay a pecuniary penalty of $15,000 in four instalments. There is to be a further order, providing for what is to happen in the event of default in the payment of any instalment of penalty. 14 The proposed probation order in this case is very like the probation orders made by Merkel J in Humax and by Tracey J in Digital Products. Section 86D contemplates orders of the kind proposed as adverse publicity orders: see orders 8 and 9 in the proposed minute of orders. 28 I also accept that the proposed penalties are consistent with the proper application of the totality and parity principles: compare Digital Products and Dataline at [64]-[75]. I was referred to a schedule of previous determinations. Whilst I have had regard to it, I have also borne in mind the observations in Dataline , where a Full Court said (at [67]-[68]): [T] he Court is confirmed in the view that there is little to be gained in undertaking ... a detailed comparative analysis of the conduct of each corporation in the identified cases, the extent to which particular officers of those corporations engaged in the contravening conduct or the scale and dimension of the conduct. The constellation of circumstances, essential character of the conduct and the factors to be weighed by the Court are inevitably sufficiently different in each case that previous determinations ultimately provide little utility in precisely informing the appropriate pecuniary penalty to be imposed in any particular contravention. However, an assessment of previous determinations in relation to resale price maintenance conduct may provide a high level broad range within which an appropriate pecuniary penalty may be imposed having regard to the character and content of the contravention and other considerations reflecting some elements broadly consistent with the evidence in the particular case. After making these observations, the Court undertook an analysis of several cases with sufficiently similar facts to provide a high level broad range of comparison.

followed,SZHPI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 306,"It is not the fact that the Tribunal has not referred to such evidence as that set forth (for example) in the Walter Turnbull report which exposes a "" question of law "" ( SZEHN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1389 at [58] per Lindgren J; SZHPI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 306 at [15] ). The question arises by reason of the Tribunal not making necessary findings of fact and referring to the evidence upon which it makes such findings. Its failure to do so is a departure from the requirements imposed by s 43(2B) and renders "" ineffective "" the appeal process to this Court. In the absence of explanation, neither Ms Davies nor this Court knows how the Tribunal reached the conclusion that it did.

referred to,Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422,"The Minister submits that a party seeking to resist the making of the orders sought in a non-claimant application must adduce or identify at least some credible evidence addressing the following matters as identified in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 , De Rose v State of South Australia [2003] FCAFC 286 ; (2003) 133 FCR 325 and De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290: a that at the time of sovereignty there was ""a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgement and observance of a body of laws and customs"" (the ""pre-sovereignty society""); b the nature and content of a normative body of laws and customs (the ""traditional laws and customs"") pursuant to which rights and interests were held at the time of sovereignty; c the nature and content of the rights and interests held at the time of sovereignty pursuant to the traditional laws and customs (the ""traditional rights and interests""); d that the pre-sovereignty society has substantially maintained its identity and existence from generation to generation in accordance with the traditional laws and customs through to the present time; e that the traditional laws and customs have been acknowledged and observed by the pre-sovereignty society and their successors, and that such acknowledgement and observance has continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty; f that since sovereignty the pre-sovereignty society and their successors have maintained a connection with the application area and have transmitted rights and interests in relation to the application area by and in accordance with the traditional laws and customs; g that they, the native title claim group (as a whole), acknowledge and observe the traditional laws and customs; h the nature and content of the traditional laws and customs observed by members of the native title claim group; i that, by the traditional laws and customs that are still observed by them, the native title claim group has a connection with the application area; j that, by the traditional laws and customs that are still observed by them, the native title claim group has rights and interests in the application area; k the nature and extent of the extant rights and interests; and, l that such rights and interests have not been extinguished, (or if extinguishment has occurred, it is to be disregarded); and are not ""antithetical to the fundamental tenets of the common law"". 55 Worimi does not need to establish that native title exists on the balance of probabilities. It is for the Court to assess the totality of the evidence to determine whether the Land Council has established, on the balance of probabilities, that native title does not exist. Worimi has identified a number of different groups, at various stages of these proceedings, that he says hold native title in the Land, including himself and his immediate family, and all Worimi people. He must also provide evidence that addresses, at the least, the Land Council's evidence that there is no native title within the principles set down in Yorta Yorta ; that there is no normative body of laws and customs in connection with the Land, the observance of which has been substantially maintained from the time of sovereignty to the present day. Worimi does not need to prove each element of native title. He is not obliged to establish native title as if it were a positive defence being asserted. He does, however, need to address native title under the Act by reference to those material matters. He must address the necessary elements sufficiently to cast doubt on the Land Council's assertion of no native title. He needs to show that there have existed traditional laws and customs in relation to the Land, the continued observance of those laws and customs and the maintenance of a connection with the Land. If he does not lead evidence as to each of those matters, elements of native title, he will need to adduce evidence, sufficient in scope and weight, as to one or more of those elements to cast doubt on the proposition that native title does not exist. 56 Worimi contends that the evidence required to discharge the Land Council's onus of proof ' may not be achieved without strict proof of historical and anthropological facts through use of widely accepted authoritative writings and expert evidence ' and ' involves consideration of the historical, archaeological, linguistic and anthropological evidence in the light of the direct testimony of Aboriginal witnesses '. Worimi says that, in determining the question of the existence or non-existence of native title on the balance of probabilities, regard should be had to the ability of the parties to adduce evidence. By this, he seems to be saying that the Court should give more weight to his evidence and discount the evidence of the Land Council. If he is, I do not accept it. 64 Based on the presumption that native title exists over the Land, Worimi contends that: &#8226; It is common ground that Lot 576 falls within traditional Worimi country. &#8226; The Land Council must prove that any connection which Aboriginal people may have had with the Land under traditional laws and customs has not been maintained. &#8226; In order to succeed, the Land Council must establish that traditional law and custom has ceased to be observed anywhere in ""Worimi country"". &#8226; It is incumbent upon the Land Council to adduce evidence from Worimi people positively to assert that no laws and customs have been passed down to them by their forebears and, additionally, there needs to be expert evidence that there were a set of normative rules traditionally adopted and followed and observed by the Worimi people. &#8226; Following Yorta Yorta , the Land Council must prove that pre-existing laws and customs have been substantially interrupted from what they were at sovereignty or no longer exist at all. &#8226; There must be evidence of the cessation of the acknowledgement of laws and observance of customs sufficient to show that those laws and customs have been abandoned by the whole of Worimi society. 65 Worimi submits that the evidence supports the inference that there was a group of Worimi people and a society of Aboriginal people who inhabited the area around Port Stephens at the time of sovereignty. For the purposes of this application, I accept that to be the case. 66 Worimi submits that, once this is accepted, it follows that this group had some form of normative rules which regulated their society and that, once this is accepted, it follows ' as a matter of logic and reason ' that, bearing in mind the burden of proof, the Land Council is required to lead sufficient evidence: (i) of the nature and existence of pre-sovereign native title rights and interests; and (ii) to the effect that these pre-sovereign rights and interests are no longer observed before the Court may infer the non-existence of native title over Lot 576. 72 In Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572, Kirby P pointed to the difficulty for Aboriginal people to provide recorded details of, for example, genealogy. At 586 589, his Honour discussed the inferences that can be drawn to overcome the absence of evidence for the period from 1788 to a later time, in that case to the 1880s. Referring to the analysis in Wigmore on Evidence, vol 2, 3 rd edition at 437, his Honour said that it is not appropriate to apply a ""presumption of continuance"" but a process of inference. His Honour was prepared to draw an inference from proved use of land in the 1880s back to the time before 1788. As he noted, it is more easily drawn in more traditional Aboriginal communities. However, in Mason , there were other aspects of the claim to native title which were not proved. Further, it is hard to see from Yorta Yorta how a presumption of native title can be said to apply. 134 The Land Council seeks a determination of the absence of native title. That means native title under the Act. In Yorta Yorta , the High Court emphasised that native title under the Act must be understood in accordance with the definition in s 223(1) of the Act. That section provides: (1) The expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where: (a) the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and (b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters; and (c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia. 135 In Yorta Yorta at [31], Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ raised the importance of identifying whether the body of traditional law and custom that intersects with the common law for the purposes of s 223(1) of the Act is that as existing at the time of sovereignty or that existing today but connected with a body of law and custom that existed at sovereignty. Their Honours reiterated what had been said in Fejo v Northern Territory [1998] HCA 58 ; (1998) 195 CLR 96. Native title, with its origin in the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous people who possess the native title is recognised by the common law. Their Honours went on to state that: ' An application for determination of native title requires the location of that intersection [between native title and the common law] and it requires that it be located by reference to [the Act]. In particular it must be located by reference to the definition of native title in s 223(1) '. A determination of the existence of native title is a creature of the Act ( Yorta Yorta at [32]). So too is a determination of the absence of native title. 136 A number of principles relevant to the present case were set out in Yorta Yorta: &#8226; Laws or customs in which native title rights or interests find their origins must be laws or customs having a normative content and deriving, therefore, from a body of norms or normative system that existed before sovereignty (at [38]). &#8226; Observable patterns of behaviour may not amount to rights or interests in relation to land or waters under the Act (at [42]). &#8226; Upon the Crown acquiring sovereignty, the normative or law-making system which then existed could not thereafter validly create new rights, duties or interests. Rights or interests in land created after sovereignty and which owed their origin and continued existence only to a normative system other than that of the new sovereign power are not given effect (at [43] and [44]). &#8226; This does not prevent the transmission of rights and interests under traditional laws and traditional customs which existed at sovereignty. Nor does it prevent any alteration to, or development of, that traditional law and custom after sovereignty. Account may at least be taken of developments of a kind contemplated by that traditional law and custom (at [44]). &#8226; ""Traditional"" law or custom is apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom. In the context of the Act, the term ""traditional"" conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions. However, in the context of the Act, ""traditional"" laws and customs equate to the normative rules that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown (at [46]). It follows that the mere use of the word ""traditional"" does not establish the normative rules necessary for the establishment of native title under the Act. &#8226; The normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed, namely the traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed, must have had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty. If that normative system has not existed throughout that period, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. Importantly, any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which right and interest must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title (at [47]). &#8226; If the society out of which the body of laws and customs arises ceases to exist as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs, the laws and customs cease to have continued existence and vitality (at [50]). 137 The Land Council relies not only upon the absence of any claimant application over the Land but also on the evidence from Aboriginal people associated with the area who have confirmed that, in their view, the native title rights and interests that Worimi asserts do not exist. The Land Council has established that no Aboriginal person other than Worimi (and some of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications) asserts that native title exists in relation to Lot 576. All of the Aboriginal witnesses called by the Land Council identified as Worimi people. All are aware of the assertions made by Worimi concerning the existence of native title in the Land and gave evidence generally rejecting those assertions. Some of those witnesses were parties to claimant applications for a determination of the existence of native title in respect of land in the Port Stephens area but none of the witnesses have filed native title claimant applications in relation to the Land or land in the immediate vicinity of Lot 576. 153 Worimi says that his family and his mother before him were removed by actions of others and that the removal was not voluntary. In an area where non-Aboriginal communities developed, many Aboriginal families lived at Karuah, which is also part of Worimi land. In deciding whether claimants, by traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed, have a present connection with land, some interruptions to enjoyment of native title rights and interests is allowed ( Gale at [108], citing Yorta Yorta and De Rose ). 163 As in Yorta Yorta , if there had been a women's site on or near the Land and Kingsley Beach, much has changed since it was used. 164 This baptism of Worimi's grandson by his daughter Beryl and wife Cynthia represents an attempt by Worimi to restore what he says his grandmother told him, as amended by his wife's practices. It does not represent continuity. Worimi has claimed that the site is sacred to all Worimi women. No woman has supported this claim, apart from some members of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications. 165 In Gale, Madgwick J was dealing with a native title claimant application from which the claimants withdrew. One of the respondents, Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council, sought an order that there was no native title over the subject land. Expert evidence had been filed in support of the claimant applications to which the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council had responded. His Honour considered Yorta Yorta and drew from it a number of relevant principles, including: &#8226; [N] ative title rights and interests derive from traditional laws and customs in the sense that they survived the acquisition of sovereignty over Australia: Yorta Yorta at [75]. &#8226; The rights and interests must be presently 'possessed' under traditional laws and customs. This requires that the normative system under which those rights or interests are possessed ... be a system that has had a 'continuous existence and vitality' since sovereignty: Yorta Yorta at [47]. &#8226; Some change to or adaptation of traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests since sovereignty will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim. &#8226; The statutory questions (in s 223) are directed to the present possession of the rights or interests, not their exercise, and to the existence of a relevant, present connection. It follows that the non-exercise of native title rights or interests by some of the persons now claiming such rights or interests ... will not inevitably be fatal. &#8226; The requirement in s 223(1)(b) for connection with land or waters by traditional laws and customs must be a connection which the peoples concerned have by their traditional laws and customs, that is the laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of the claimants at the time of sovereignty. It is the normative quality of the normative rules which rendered the Crown's radical title acquired at sovereignty subject to the rights and interests then existing and which are now identified as native title. &#8226; It is an important qualification that the acknowledgment and observance of those rules need only have continued substantially, and not entirely, uninterrupted. &#8226; Nonetheless, it is necessary to demonstrate that it is the normative system of the pre-sovereign society out of which the claimed rights and interests arise. This entails that it be shown that that society has continued to exist as a body united by its acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs. &#8226; Acknowledgement and observance of those laws and customs must have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty. It is not enough that there be a body of laws and customs originating in the common acceptance by or agreement of a new society of indigenous peoples to acknowledge and observe them, notwithstanding that they are similar to or even identical with those of an earlier and different society. 167 The positive assertion of native title rights and interests requires more than vague assertions of membership of a group of people and of ""custodianship"" of land. Worimi's facts and contentions comprehensively fail to establish the elements of native title required by s 223 of the Act. They do not establish native title within the meaning of Yorta Yorta . They do not identify the alleged content of the normative body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the pre-sovereignty society nor how those laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted. While Worimi is not required positively to establish native title in order to resist the Land Council's application, he must present evidence which is sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements that the evidence does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist. 169 As the High Court said in Yorta Yorta , the relevant laws and customs must be rules having normative content. Without that quality, there may be observable patterns of behaviour but not rights or interests in relation to land or waters. Rights or interests created after sovereignty are insufficient, although there may be changes in the traditional laws and customs, at least to the extent that such changes and developments were contemplated by traditional laws and customs. 170 As was said in Yorta Yorta at [47] and repeated in Bodney at [47], if the normative system has not existed throughout the period since sovereignty, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. The law and custom arise out of and go to define a particular society, a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs ( Yorta Yorta at [49]; Bodney at [46]). ' Unless a society has, and acknowledges and observes, laws and customs under which native title rights and interests are possessed, there can be no native title rights whether communal, group or individual ' ( Bodney at [157]). It is therefore necessary for a person claiming native title to show that the normative system that existed at sovereignty is substantially the same as the one that exists today ( Bodney at [47]). This must be established for each generation to establish that the laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted ( Bodney at [70] [74]). 184 It follows from Yorta Yorta at [51] [56] that native title, if it existed pre-sovereignty, ceases to exist for the purposes of the Act if the society, being the Worimi people, the Maiaangal clan or the Garuahgal clan, ceased to acknowledge and observe the laws and customs that Worimi describes. The rights and interests to which those laws and customs give rise are not possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed. They ceased to exist and the later adoption of the laws and customs does not give rise to rights and interests rooted in pre-sovereignty traditional law and custom. 185 The changes in Worimi's description of the persons who, he says, observe or observed the traditional laws and customs in respect of the Land have not assisted in the analysis of the evidence. As set out in Worimi 2007 and Worimi 2006 , he has changed the identification of the persons said to be relevant. As to the identification of family members in the claim group, Worimi has included, variously apart from himself, his wife and children, all his sisters and their daughters and his mother. He was not consistent in his evidence, asserting that he was bringing the claim on behalf of the Garuahgal women, his family and all Worimi people. Irrespective of the group said to hold native title over the Land, the requirements of s 223 of the Act are not satisfied. While Worimi was not required to establish native title in accordance with s 223 of the Act in order to resist the Land Council's application, given the time available to Worimi since these proceedings were commenced, he has had ample opportunity to formulate his contentions with reference to s 223 of the Act in order to cast sufficient doubt on the Land Council's case. 186 The evidence is that the observance of the traditional laws and customs ceased so far as a women's site on the Land is concerned. The evidence is not of adaptation of traditional laws and customs but of substantial interruption, amounting to cessation, of observance."
considered,Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (2000) 179 ALR 593,"Instead, the payment secured the use of the Premises for the purposes of generating income from the casino. There was no allegation and could be no allegation that the Prepayment of rent was a sham. The two leases (the Construction Lease and the Freehold Lease) were necessary and existed, the rent was an agreed amount, was payable and was paid. Although labels can never be determinative ( Jupiters Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCAFC 206 ; (2002) 118 FCR 163 at [26] ; South Australian Battery Makers at 655 and Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (2000) 179 ALR 593 at [36]), the Prepayment was in this case, as it was described a prepayment of rent."
cited,Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd v Festival Industries Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617,"However, there is a good deal of authority as to the meaning of trade or commerce in other constitutional contexts, particularly in relation to s 92 as it was previously construed (eg, W &amp; A McArthur Ltd v Queensland [1920] HCA 77 ; (1920) 28 CLR 530; Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd v Festival Industries Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617; Hospital Provident Fund Pty Ltd v Victoria [1953] HCA 8 ; (1953) 87 CLR 1; and APLA Limited v Legal Services Commissioner (NSW) [2005] HCA 44 per Gleeson CJ and Heydon J at [37] and Gummow J at [168] [170]), and as to the phrase 'in trade or commerce' in s 52 of the Act (eg Village Building Co Ltd v Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 240 ; (2004) 139 FCR 330)."
applied,Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1,"kind of waiver that is in issue in this case is commonly referred to as imputed or implied waiver. The former expression is preferable, as it reflects the way in which the High Court expressed the governing legal principles in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 ( 'Mann' ). In Mann at 13 [29], Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said: 'Waiver may be express or implied. Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is ""imputed by operation of law"". This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege. Thus, in Benecke v National Australia Bank , the client was held to have waived privilege by giving evidence, in legal proceedings, concerning her instructions to a barrister in related proceedings, even though she apparently believed she could prevent the barrister from giving the barrister's version of those instructions. She did not subjectively intend to abandon the privilege. She may not even have turned her mind to the question. However, her intentional act was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of the communication. What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.' The concluding part of this passage draws attention to the fact that the test for imputed waiver had previously been expressed in terms of fairness: see Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 (' Maurice' ) at 481 per Gibbs CJ, 487 488 per Mason and Brennan JJ, 492 493 per Deane J, and 497 498 per Dawson J. Under the test propounded in Mann , it is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect which effects a waiver of the privilege. Fairness has become a subsidiary consideration; it may be relevant to the court's assessment of inconsistency in some contexts but not in others. In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Limited [2006] FCAFC 86 (' Rio Tinto' ) at [44], the Full Court (Kenny, Stone and Edmonds JJ) said that there was a good deal of doubt whether the language used by the majority in Mann worked any real change in the principle which governs imputed waiver. This observation was made somewhat tentatively and was not material to the Court's decision. My own view is that a test expressed in terms of inconsistency more readily accommodates the variety of situations in which questions of imputed waiver can arise than a test expressed in terms of fairness. The criterion of fairness is readily understandable in the context of inter partes litigation, but it is difficult to apply sensibly in other contexts: see the observations by McHugh J in Mann at 40 [128] and Toohey J in Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83 (' Goldberg v Ng' ) at 110. AWB submitted that this Court should hold that there has been no imputed waiver because the Commonwealth has made no attempt to identify why it would be unfair or inequitable for AWB to maintain privilege in the underlying investigations. This submission immediately raises the question unfair or inequitable to whom? I doubt that any question arises of fairness to the Commission it is an arm of the executive government charged with the investigation of specified matters. Nor does any question arise of fairness to the Commonwealth. Fairness presupposes a balancing of interests between parties who are in dispute. In that context, partial disclosures raise a question of fairness because there is the capacity to mislead one party to the dispute to his or her detriment. These concepts do not translate easily to the present case: cf McHugh J in Mann at 40 [127]-[128]. There is also the difficulty that, outside the framework of an inter partes dispute, fairness is truly a term of 'indeterminate reference': Mann at 40 [129] per McHugh J, citing RJ Desiatnik, Legal Professional Privilege in Australia , 1999, p 122. 133 Mann anticipated that there will be cases in which considerations of fairness have little or no role to play. This is such a case. The broad question posed by Mann is whether, and to what extent, AWB's disclosures are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the documents which are at issue in these proceedings. This question wraps up several subsidiary issues, in particular whether AWB's disclosures involved, on each occasion, a disclosure of the gist or substance of its legal advice, whether AWB consciously deployed that advice so as to advance its own commercial or other interests, and, if so, whether that disclosure has resulted in an imputed waiver of privilege over any and what associated materials. In any application of Mann , the starting point must be an analysis of the disclosures or other acts or omissions of the party claiming privilege that are said to be inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the privileged material: see Rio Tinto at [45]. The disclosures in question here were made variously to the IIC, to the Australian Government, to the Commission and in some instances via the procedures of the Commission to the public at large. In my opinion, there is no reason why these disclosures cannot support a finding that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated material. AWB submitted that imputed waiver cannot arise in the context of a commission established under the RCA. Alternatively, it submitted that the coercive and inquisitorial context in which the alleged waiver has taken place is an important factor which strongly militates against waiver. These submissions ignore the voluntary disclosures that AWB made to the Australian Government. In any event, I am not persuaded that AWB's disclosures to the Commission and the IIC are incapable of giving rise to an imputed waiver. Leaving aside any question of waiver, AWB was entitled to maintain legal professional privilege in the course of proceedings before the Commission and, by and large, it sought to do so. To the extent that AWB has already produced documents to the Commission containing legal advice or instructions, it did so because it recognised that actions it had taken outside the Commission had the consequence of waiving privilege over those documents. As for the oral evidence that the Commonwealth now relies upon, Lindberg, Cooper and Scales were senior executives of AWB when they gave that evidence to the Commission. There is nothing before me to suggest that they were not speaking as executives of AWB when they gave their evidence, or that their evidence fell outside the scope of their authority from AWB. Further, their evidence was given in the presence of AWB's legal representatives, without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. Lindberg, Cooper and Scales may have been compelled to give evidence at the Commission, but they were under no compulsion to reveal the gist or substance of legal advice that had been obtained by AWB. In these circumstances, I infer that the relevant evidence given by Lindberg, Cooper and Scales was given with the authority or acquiescence of AWB. I also infer that AWB was content for the evidence to be given at public hearings of the Commission, having regard to its own commercial interests. The evidence before me makes it clear that AWB was concerned to defend its integrity and commercial reputation in the course of the Commission's hearings. I infer that AWB made the assessment that it would advance its commercial interests if it were to be known publicly that it had undertaken extensive legal reviews and that, as a result, it had obtained legal advice that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any improper or unlawful conduct in breach of the United Nations' sanctions. AWB was content for information of this character to be disclosed publicly in relation to both Project Rose and Project Water. It would, of course, be a different case if the documents and information that the Commonwealth relies upon were disclosed under legal compulsion. On any view, the fact that documents and information were disclosed under compulsion would be very relevant to the question whether the person claiming privilege had engaged in inconsistent conduct. There is, moreover, authority to the effect that a production of documents or evidence under compulsion will not result in any waiver of privilege: Goldman v Hesper [1988] 1 WLR 1238 ( 'Goldman' ); Trans America Computer Co Inc v IBM Corporation 573 F2d 646 (9 th Cir 1978) ( 'Trans America' ) at 651. AWB's disclosures to the IIC were not made under legal compulsion. They were made by choice under a confidentiality regime negotiated by AWB. The Memorandum of Understanding between AWB and the IIC provided that AWB could withhold documents from the IIC on grounds of commercial sensitivity or legal professional privilege, or if there was a risk that AWB, its officers or employees would be exposed to breaches of Australian law. It also provided that any interviews conducted by the IIC of AWB officers or employees could be undertaken in the presence of a personal legal counsel and/or up to two representatives of AWB. AWB thereby retained the right to object to any question that intruded into areas protected by legal professional privilege. On the evidence before me, including in particular the various briefings which Hargreaves gave to the Australian Government, it is clear that AWB decided that it needed to cooperate, and be seen to cooperate, with the IIC so as to retain the support of the Australian Government and to protect and defend its commercial reputation. I do not agree with AWB's submission that, even if its disclosures were not compelled by law, the inquisitorial context in which they took place is a factor which strongly militates against waiver. In Australia, legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right that can be asserted outside the context of adversarial litigation. It can, for instance, be invoked to resist the production of documents in answer to a search warrant or the giving of information or the production of documents pursuant to coercive statutory powers or notices: Daniels at 552-553 [9] [11] and 563 [44]; Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52. As legal professional privilege can be invoked outside the context of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, logic suggests that it should be capable of being waived if the claimant engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect. It should not matter whether the conduct takes place within, or outside, the framework of the proceedings or investigatory process in which a demand has been made for the production of privileged documents or information. The crucial question is whether the conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. The disclosure of privileged communications to a third party can result in an imputed waiver of privilege, even if there is no intention of waiving privilege and the disclosure is for a limited and specific purpose. In Mann , the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory conveyed legal advice, on a confidential basis, to a member of the Territory's Legislative Assembly to enable him to consider the reasonableness of the Government's decision to settle certain legal proceedings. The majority decision turned on the fact that the disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly was not regarded as disclosure to a third party. In their joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said at 15 [35] that: 'The purpose of the privilege being to protect the Territory from subsequent disclosure of the legal advice it received concerning the litigation instituted by the appellant, there was nothing inconsistent with that purpose in the Chief Minister conveying the terms of that advice, on a confidential basis, to a member of the Legislative Assembly who wished to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the Territory in relation to the litigation.' However, their Honours also observed that, while the voluntary disclosure of privileged legal advice to a third party will not necessarily waive privilege, it can do so. They said that Goldberg v Ng illustrates that, depending on the circumstances, the disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party for a limited and specific purpose, and on terms as to confidentiality, can have the consequence of waiving privilege. McHugh J dissented. In his view, any disclosure of privileged material to a third party who is a stranger to the privileged relationship (ie to a person who is not the lawyer or the client) should have the consequence that privilege in that material is waived as against the world: at 34 [108], 37-38 [118], 42 [133]-[134]. As I read his Honour's judgment, the key reason why his Honour preferred a bright line rule of this kind is that it would ensure that legal professional privilege was not extended beyond the rationales that support it (at 37 [117]-[118]): 'Ensuring candid communications between a lawyer and a client is unlikely to be endangered if a privilege holder is held to waive privilege because he or she has voluntarily disclosed the communication to a stranger. Whether the communication will be disclosed in the future to a stranger to the privilege is entirely within the control of the client. At that stage, the client will determine whether his or her interests are best served by retaining the privilege or disclosing the communication. But it is difficult to see how the possibility of voluntary disclosure will prevent the client being candid with his or her lawyer. ... A client who voluntarily discloses privileged information to a stranger to the privileged relationship has made a choice, based no doubt on considerations personal to him or her, that the purpose for which the communication is disclosed to the stranger is more important than protecting the absolute confidentiality of the communication by preventing the stranger from having knowledge of it. The person may be encouraged to do so, as in Goldberg v Ng , by an expectation that the stranger will not further disclose the communication. But in my opinion, if privileged material is voluntarily disclosed to a stranger to the privileged relationship, the fact that it may be received under an obligation of confidence should not be relevant to whether privileged is waived.' On the facts, McHugh J considered that disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly who was not a member of the Executive Government was relevantly a disclosure to a stranger to the privileged relationship: at 44 [139]. In Goldberg v Ng , the respondents sued their solicitor, Goldberg, for failure to account for monies received and disbursed by him as their solicitor. They also made a professional conduct complaint against him to the Law Society of New South Wales. In answer to the complaint, Goldberg prepared statements, with annexures that included a draft brief to counsel, and submitted them to the Society's professional conduct department. In doing so, Goldberg told the Society that the statements and the annexures were confidential and he wished to retain his legal professional privilege in them. The Society dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no evidence of professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct. Subsequently, in the course of the Supreme Court proceedings instituted by the respondents against Goldberg, the respondents served a subpoena on the Society requiring it to produce documents relating to the complaint against Goldberg. All of the members of the High Court held that there had been no express or intentional waiver by Goldberg of his legal professional privilege in the statements and annexures. The issue that divided the Court was whether waiver should be imputed by operation of law. Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ held at 100-102 that it should because the professional complaint and the Supreme Court proceedings were but different emanations of the one dispute, and Goldberg's provision of the statements to the Society was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of demonstrating the reliability of his denial of the alleged failure to account. Their Honours analysed the issue in terms of 'fairness', but they could equally, and perhaps more appropriately, have done so in terms of inconsistency. Toohey and Gummow JJ dissented in separate judgments. Each expressed the view that waiver should not be imputed because the disclosures by Goldberg were made to a third party for a limited and specific purpose. Toohey J said at 110 that the following factors militated strongly against any implied or imputed waiver: first, Goldberg disclosed material to the Society because of a complaint against him on an undertaking by the Society that the contents would be kept confidential; secondly, the disclosure was made in the context of the Society's investigation of a complaint in pursuance of its statutory powers and, consequently, it could be regarded as having been made for the purposes of the Act; and thirdly, the disclosure was confined to the Society. Gummow J said at 123 that, as the disclosures were made in the context of compulsory statutory processes, the circumstances of the case supplied no sufficient reason for depriving Goldberg of privilege, even allowing for the advantage he sought to gain by making the disclosure. The case of Restom v Battenberg [2006] FCA 781 provides an example of a case where disclosures to a third party triggered a waiver of legal professional privilege. In the course of bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor claimed privilege over a letter that passed between his Australian and Scottish solicitors. Stone J held that the disclosure of the contents of the letter to the Scottish Employment Tribunal was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the letter and constituted a waiver of privilege. In Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd (1995) 36 NSWLR 275, which predated Goldberg v Ng and Mann , Giles J held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material, on terms of confidentiality, did not result in a loss of privilege. In Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 253, Sackville J said that it follows from Goldberg v Ng that the disclosure of a privileged communication for a limited purpose and subject to a confidentiality requirement may, or may not, amount to a waiver of privilege, depending on the circumstances of the case: at 262-263 [42]-[43]. On the facts of that case, Sackville J held that a disclosure of legal advice to the solicitors and representatives of two other companies, on strict terms as to confidentiality and for the purpose of those other companies obtaining legal advice, did not result in an imputed waiver. His Honour distinguished Goldberg v Ng as a case in which the disclosure was made to gain an advantage over the opposing party in related litigation: at 263 [45]. There are several English cases in which disclosure to a third party for a limited and specific purpose has not resulted in a loss of privilege: British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 1 WLR 1113 ( 'British Coal' ); Goldman ; and Gotha City v Southeby's (No 1) [1988] 1 WLR 1114. In British Coal , Neill LJ (with whom Stocker LJ and Dillon LJ agreed) held that the disclosure of documents by the plaintiff to the police to assist in a criminal investigation and criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege. Neill LJ said at 822: 'In my judgment the action of the plaintiff in making documents available for the purpose of the criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege to which it was entitled in the present civil proceedings. Its action in regard to both the category A and the category B documents was in accordance with its duty to assist in the conduct of the criminal proceedings, and could not properly be construed as an express or implied waiver of its rights in its own civil litigation. Indeed, it would in my view be contrary to public policy if the plaintiff's action in making the documents available in the criminal proceedings had the effect of automatically removing the cloak of privilege which would otherwise be available to them in the civil litigation for which the cloak was designed.' In Goldman , the Court of Appeal considered the effect of a statutory requirement that a claimant for costs must disclose privileged materials to the Court's taxing officers. Taylor LJ (with whom Woolf LJ and Lord Donaldson MR agreed) said that once a party puts forward privileged documents as part of his case for costs, the privilege is relaxed temporarily and pro hac vice . If the taxing officers felt compelled by natural justice considerations to disclose part or all of the contents of a privileged document to the opposite party, that disclosure would be for the purposes of the taxation only and would not amount to a waiver that prevented the owner of the document from reasserting privilege in any subsequent context: at 102. McHugh J took a stricter view in Giannarelli v Wraith (No 2) [1991] HCA 2 ; (1991) 171 CLR 592. His Honour noted that in Victoria, unlike in England, a litigant can refuse to produce documents to the taxing master on the grounds of legal professional privilege. However, McHugh J said that if the litigant choses to produce privileged documents to the taxing master, then the litigant will be taken to have waived privilege and must let the opposing parties see the documents. His Honour did not countenance any middle course under which privilege could be waived solely for the purposes of the taxation and then re-asserted in some other context: at 607. The general rule adopted in the United States is that any voluntary disclosure of privileged communications by a client to a third party breaches the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship and therefore waives the privilege, not only as to the specific communication disclosed but as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter: see Weil v Investment/Indicators Research and Management Inc 647 F2d 18 (9 th Cir 1981) at 24; United States v Aronoff 466 FSupp 855 (DC NY 1979) at 862 [9]-[10]; In re Sealed Case 676 F2d 793 (DC Cir 1982) (' re Sealed Case' ) at 809 [6] [7]; United States v AT &amp; T Co 642 F2d 1285 (DC Cir 1980) at 1299; cf Diotima Shipping Corp v Chase, Leavitt &amp; Co ., 102 F.R.D. 532 (D Me 1984); von Bulow v von Bulow , 114 F.R.D. 71 (SD NY 1987); and T Harman, Fairness and the Doctrine of Subject Matter Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege in Extrajudicial Disclosure Situations (1988) University of Illinois Law Review 999. The US courts have also considered whether a disclosure of privileged material to government investigators will have the consequence of waiving privilege. In re Sealed Case , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia considered whether a corporation that had submitted its own investigating counsel's report into alleged bribes and improper payments to the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') pursuant to voluntary disclosure programs had thereby impliedly waived its privilege over documents which were clearly identified in the report. The Court held that, by revealing part of privileged communications to the agencies to gain a commercial advantage, the corporation had made a disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. Accordingly, the Court held that the corporation had waived privilege as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter. The principle applied by the Court was that (at 818 [29]): 'Courts need not allow a claim of privilege when the party claiming the privilege seeks to use it in a way that is not consistent with the purpose of the privilege. Thus, since the purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to protect the confidentiality of attorney-client communications in order to foster candor within the attorney-client relationship, voluntary breach of confidence or selective disclosure for tactical purposes waives the privilege. Disclosure is inconsistent with confidentiality, and courts need not permit hide-and-seek manipulation of confidences in order to foster candor.' The Court rejected an argument that waiver should not be imputed because the corporation had disclosed the investigating counsel's report for specific and limited purposes only. In doing so, it declined to follow the decision in Diversified Industries Inc v Meredith 572 F2d 596 (8 th Cir 1977) ( 'Diversified Industries' ) at 611 in which the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that disclosures to the SEC under a voluntary disclosure program did not constitute a waiver to anyone but the SEC. It noted that the decision in Diversified Industries was rejected in Permian Corp v United States 665 F2d 1215 (DC Cir 1981) at 1220-1222 on the ground that it unnecessarily expanded the scope of attorney-client privilege: see also In re Weiss 596 F2d 1185 (4 th Cir 1979) at 1186. Like the District Columbia Circuit, the First, Third, Fourth, Sixth and Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal have rejected the approach adopted by the Eighth Circuit in Diversified Industries : see AM Pinto, Cooperation and Self-Interest are Strange Bedfellows: Limited Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege through Production of Privileged Documents in a Government Investigation (2004) 106 West Virginia Law Review 359, p 372; RH Porter, Voluntary Disclosures to Federal Agencies Their Impact on the Ability of Corporations to Protect from Discovery Materials Developed During the Course of Internal Investigations (1990) 39 Catholic University Law Review 1007, pp 1029-1052. The US courts have accepted that there will be no imputed or implied waiver of privilege if the disclosure of the privileged material is involuntary and compelled by law: see eg Trans America. The Canadian courts apply a waiver test that is based on considerations of fairness and consistency: see S &amp; K Processors Ltd v Campbell Ave Herring Producers Ltd (1983) CPC 146 (BCSC) at 150; Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v Canada (Director of the Canadian Museum of Nature) [1995] 3 FC 643 ; British Columbia (Securities Commission) v BDS (2000) BCJ No 2111 (BCSC), affirmed (2003) 226 DLR (4 th ) 393; and RD Manes and MP Silver, Solicitor-Client Privilege in Canadian Law , Butterworths, 1993, p 207. As in the United States, waiver will not be imputed if privileged material is produced to a government regulator under compulsion of law. Putting to one side its provision of Mr Tracey QC's advices and instructions and its briefings to the Australian Government, AWB disputed that the disclosures it made to the IIC and the Commission disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB obtained as a result of Project Rose or Project Water. It contended that these disclosures did no more than refer to the existence of legal advice, without disclosing its substance. Alternatively, AWB argued that the record of Lindberg's interview with the IIC, and the evidence given to the Commission by Lindberg, Cooper and Scales, cannot be related to any particular piece of legal advice, other than that provided by Mr Tracey QC. The applicable principles are set out in my decision in AWB v Cole at [135] [139]. The authorities draw a distinction between a mere reference to the existence of legal advice, which will not usually amount to a waiver, and cases in which the gist or substance of the legal advice has been disclosed: see Maurice at 481, 488 and 493; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd [1996] HCA 15 ; (1996) 70 ALJR 603 at 607; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 12; Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360 at 376-377; and Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 (' Bennett' ) at 104-105 [6] [9]. In Bennett , the Full Court (Tamberlin, Emmett and Gyles JJ) held that legal representatives of the Australian Customs Service had waived privilege in legal advice by stating openly that they had given advice to Customs that a particular regulation did not prohibit public comment by an officer on matters of public administration. The trial judge had held that a disclosure of the legal position or stance that a lawyer had advised a client to take was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication giving the advice. The trial judge also appeared to draw a distinction between statements which disclose the conclusion or logical result of legal advice, and statements which disclose the content of the legal advice and its reasoning: see Tamberlin J at 105 [10] and Gyles J at 118 [61]. The Full Court rejected this approach. Gyles J stated at 119 [65] that the voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made, including the reasons for the conclusion. Tamberlin J said at 104 [6]: 'In my view, it would be inconsistent and unfair, having disclosed and used the substance of the advice in this way, to now seek to maintain privilege in respect of the relevant parts of that advice which pertain to the expressed conclusion. It may perhaps have been different if it had been simply asserted that the client has taken legal advice and that the position which was adopted having considered the advice, is that certain action will be taken or not taken. In those circumstances, the substance of the advice is not disclosed but merely the fact that there was some advice and that it was considered. However, once the conclusion in the advice is stated, together with the effect of it, then in my view, there is imputed waiver of the privilege. The whole point of an advice is the final conclusion. This is the situation in this case.' Subsequently, Tamberlin J was confronted with a case that was very similar to the one he hypothesised in Bennett . In Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v NINOX Television Ltd (2005) 65 IPR 442, the applicant contended that the respondents had waived privilege in various legal advices because of the way in which the respondents had publicly referred to the advice. Tamberlin J held that there had been no waiver. He concluded that the mere assertion that advice had been taken, and the fact that action is then taken by the client, is not sufficient, unless the two are linked in such a way that it is apparent that the advice is that specified action should be taken. His Honour also made the following observations at 446-447 [26]: 'Whilst I accept that, in some circumstances, a clear disclosure of the ""bottom line"" of the advice, and the course of conduct taken thereafter, may be sufficient to amount to waiver of legal professional privilege, I do not think these matters have been established in the present case. On a fair and reasonable reading, the statement to the effect that senior counsel had been engaged and that he had reviewed matters in detail and that steps were being taken based on his recommendations is not sufficient to amount to a waiver of the legal advice. The substance or content of the advice is not disclosed with specificity or clarity. Questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree and, in this instance, I am not persuaded that the conduct, assertions or admissible evidence are sufficient to warrant the necessary implication that legal professional privilege has been waived.' The principles discussed in Bennett were applied in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 12 ) [2006] FCA 348. The issue was whether a statement in a discovered document that '[o]ur legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against Optus is low' had the consequence of waiving privilege in the legal advice that it referred to. Sackville J held that it did; the statement voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice: at [12]. In Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 224 ALR 299, the Commissioner of Taxation filed particulars with the Court stating that the Commissioner would be relying on specified grounds 'which have been confirmed by Senior Tax Counsel... and supported by AGS... and opinions obtained from counsel'. The taxpayer contended that the Commissioner had thereby waived privilege in the legal advice of the Australian Government Solicitor and the opinions of counsel. Sundberg J held that these references voluntarily disclosed the conclusion or substance of the advice and consequently privilege had been waived. Sundberg J's decision went on appeal to the Full Court, but the Full Court's decision turned on the alternative ground of issue waiver: Rio Tinto at [72]. The Full Court considered that, in the particulars, the Commissioner had made an assertion that put the contents of the documents containing legal advice in issue, or necessarily laid them open to scrutiny, with the consequence that there was an inconsistency between the making of the assertion and the maintenance of the privilege. AWB submitted that the reasoning in Bennett was unsound, particularly the holding that the disclosure of the conclusion stated in legal advice will amount to a waiver of the whole of the advice. AWB did not refer to any authorities that supported this submission and I reject it. In my view, it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of the gist, substance or conclusion of legal advice will amount to a waiver in respect of the whole of the relevant advice. ASSOCIATED MATERIAL Turning to the scope of any imputed waiver, it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of privileged documents can result in a waiver of privilege over those documents and associated material. The test applied to determine the scope of any waiver of associated material is whether the material that the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the same issue or subject matter: Maurice at 482 and 484 per Gibbs CJ, 488 per Mason and Brennan JJ, and 498 499 per Dawson J. In Maurice , Gibbs CJ said at 482: '... Similarly, where a party disclosed a document which contained part only of a memorandum which dealt with a single subject-matter, and then read the document to the judge in the course of opening the case, it was held that privilege was waived as to the whole memorandum: Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co . In that case Templeman LJ said: "" ... the rule that privilege relating to a document which deals with one subject matter cannot be waived as to part and asserted as to the remainder is based on the possibility that any use of part of a document may be unfair or misleading, that the party who possesses the document is clearly not the person who can decide whether a partial disclosure is misleading or not, nor can the judge decide without hearing argument, nor can he hear argument unless the document is disclosed as a whole to the other side. Once disclosure has taken place by introducing part of the document into evidence or using it in court it cannot be erased."" The same test must be applied in deciding whether the use in legal proceedings of one document impliedly waives privilege in associated material. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation [No 2] Mustill J dealt with this question and suggested the following test: "" ... where a party is deploying in court material which would otherwise be privileged, the opposite party and the court must have an opportunity of satisfying themselves that what the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the issue in question. To allow an individual item to be plucked out of context would be to risk injustice through its real weight or meaning being misunderstood.""' Dawson J discussed the authorities at 498-499: 'In Geo. Doland Ltd v Blackburn Robson Coates &amp; Co waiver of privilege with respect to a conversation between solicitor and client, which took place before litigation was contemplated, was held to extend to any other communications in relation to the subject-matters of the conversation, although the implied waiver was held not to cover similar documents which came into existence for the purpose of prosecuting the litigation. This decision was not followed in General Accident Corporation Ltd v Tanter where a distinction was drawn between the waiver of privilege before a trial and the further waiver of privilege by calling evidence in a trial. In the latter situation the waiver was held to extend to the transaction constituted by the privileged communication but not to the subject-matter of that communication arising upon other privileged occasions. General Accident Corporation Ltd v Tanter has been criticized for the distinction which it draws between waiver by the tender of evidence of a privileged communication and waiver by the disclosure of the communication in some other way and for the restriction which it places upon the extent of associative waiver: see Phipson on Evidence , par 15-20. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation [No 2] , a broader view was taken by Mustill J that "" ... where a party chooses to deploy evidence which would otherwise be privileged the court and the opposition must, in relation to the issue in question, be given the opportunity to satisfy themselves that they have the whole of the material and not merely a fragment"". This view was approved by the Court of Appeal in Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co . In the United States it has been widely held that voluntary disclosure of the content of a privileged attorney communication constitutes waiver of the privilege with respect to all other such communications upon the same subject-matter: Weil v Investment/Indicators, Research and Management and the cases there cited; Diotima Shipping Corp v Chase, Leavitt &amp; Co ; United States v Aronoff ; In re Sealed Case .' AWB relied upon the way in which the principle was formulated by the Court of Appeal in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell [2002] VSCA 197 ; (2002) 7 VR 524 at 564 [121] : 'A reference in one letter of advice to an earlier letter of advice does not expose the latter to scrutiny by the other party to litigation merely because legal professional privilege is waived in relation to the former: implied waiver is not so generous a doctrine. As we apprehend it, where legal professional privilege is waived in relation to one piece (or part) of advice, the privilege is impliedly waived in relation to another if - and only if - that other is necessary to a proper understanding of the first. As established by the High Court (at least since Mann v. Carnell ) the test in such cases is whether it would be ""inconsistent"" for a party to rely upon, and so to waive legal professional privilege in respect of, the one without also being taken to have waived privilege in respect of the other.' It is no doubt correct that a mere reference to the existence of legal advice in a disclosed document will not be regarded as a waiver of its contents, albeit a different conclusion would follow if the gist, substance or conclusion of the legal advice is voluntarily disclosed. But, with great respect to their Honours, the proposition concerning waiver of associated material is expressed too narrowly and in a way that is not consistent with the test propounded by the High Court in Maurice . The principle propounded by the Court of Appeal may work adequately enough in some circumstances, particularly where privilege is sought to be maintained over one part of a single piece of legal advice, but in other circumstances it will not give effect to the principles explained in Maurice. A common application of associated material waiver relates to the case where an expert report has been prepared in reliance upon other documents. In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Southcorp Ltd (2003) 46 ACSR 438 at 441-442 [21], Lindgren J summarised the applicable principles: '1. Ordinarily the confidential briefing or instructing by a prospective litigant's lawyers of an expert to provide a report of his or her opinion to be used in the anticipated litigation attracts client legal privilege: cf Wheeler v Le Marchant (1881) 17 Ch D 675; Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1979) 36 FLR 244 at 246; Interchase Corp Ltd (in liq) v Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd (No 1) [1999] 1 Qd R 141 (Interchase) at 151 per Pincus JA, at 160 per Thomas J. 2. Copies of documents, whether the originals are privileged or not, where the copies were made for the purpose of forming part of confidential communications between the client's lawyers and the expert witness, ordinarily attract the privilege: Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 (Propend)...; Interchase , per Pincus JA; Spassked Pty Ltd v Cmr of Taxation (No 4) (2002) 50 ATR 70 at [17]. 3. Documents generated unilaterally by the expert witness, such as working notes, field notes, and the witness's own drafts of his or her report, do not attract privilege because they are not in the nature of, and would not expose, communications: cf Interchase at 161-2 per Thomas J. 4. Ordinarily disclosure of the expert's report for the purpose of reliance on it in the litigation will result in an implied waiver of the privilege in respect of the brief or instructions or documents referred to in (1) and (2) above, at least if the appropriate inference to be drawn is that they were used in a way that could be said to influence the content of the report, because, in these circumstances, it would be unfair for the client to rely on the report without disclosure of the brief, instructions or documents; cf Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 481... per Gibbs CJ, CLR 487--488... per Mason and Brennan JJ, CLR 492-493... per Deane J, CLR 497--498... per Dawson J; Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83 at 98... per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, CLR 109... per Toohey J; Instant Colour Pty Ltd v Canon Australia Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 870... ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Lux Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 89... at [46] . 5. Similarly, privilege cannot be maintained in respect of documents used by an expert to form an opinion or write a report, regardless of how the expert came by the documents; Interchase at 148--150 per Pincus JA, at 161 per Thomas J. 6. It may be difficult to establish at an early stage whether documents which were before an expert witness influenced the content of his or her report, in the absence of any reference to them in the report: cf Dingwall v Commonwealth of Australia (1992) 39 FCR 521; Tirango Nominees Pty Ltd v Dairy Vale Foods Ltd (No 2) (1998) 83 FCR 397 at 400;... ACCC v Lux at [46].' In Thomas v New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 380 (' Thomas' ), McClellan CJ at Common Law applied these principles to the documents which underpinned or supported the advice of counsel. His Honour stated at [17]: 'Although in the present case the primary document for which privilege was expressly waived was the advice of counsel, I can discern no difference in principle between such an advice and the advice or report of an expert retained for the purpose of the litigation. As I have indicated, I am satisfied that counsel relied upon instructions which they were given and, it would appear, relied upon medical reports in a way which influenced the content of the advice which they gave. Accordingly, insofar as there are documents which were relied upon in the preparation of the advice falling within categories 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the notice to produce, the service of the affidavit impliedly waived privilege in those documents.' Later at [20] his Honour said: '... In the present case the plaintiff disclosed the advice in these proceedings for the purpose of obtaining whatever assistance he could from that advice in pursuit of his claim. To my mind, that disclosure waived his privilege both in the advice itself and the documents which were used by counsel and which influenced the content of the advice. Waiver having occurred, the fact that the advice was not ultimately tendered is, to my mind, not relevant. Having sought an advantage, the plaintiff was bound by the course he had taken and accordingly is amenable to producing the relevant documents in response to an appropriate notice to produce.' In Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited v Commonwealth (1993) 40 FCR 507, French J applied the principle of associated material waiver in a case where one joint venturer disclosed significant elements of legal advice it had obtained in relation to mining leases held by the joint venture partners. His Honour held that the disclosure brought about an implied waiver of other legal advices obtained by the other joint venturers in relation to the mining leases. His Honour said at 509 that it was significant that the disclosures were made for the benefit of the joint venture as a whole and, although there was no direct evidence on the point, he considered that it was difficult to imagine that the disclosures would have occurred against the wishes of the other joint venturers or indeed without their consent. In England, the principle has been applied to documents which underpin or support expert evidence: see Dunlop Slazenger International Ltd v Joe Bloggs Sports Limited [2003] EDWCA Civ 901; Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd v Debiopharm SA [2006] EWHC 164 (Pat); and L'Oreal SA v Bellure NV [2006] EWHC 1503 (Ch). Several English cases illustrate the practical operation of the principle. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation (No 2) [1981] Com LR 138 (' Nea Karteria' ), a lawyer gave evidence that he had conducted an interview on the basis of a list of questions prepared by the plaintiffs' lawyers. While privilege was waived with respect to the witnesses' answers, the plaintiffs sought to maintain privilege with respect to the list of questions: at 139-140. Mustill J (as his Lordship then was) held at 140 that privilege over the list of questions had been waived by implication: 'It seems to me that the written questions were, so to speak, part of the meeting. They were in a sense an agenda for the meeting. They formed the basis for one-half of the exchange between the lawyer and [the witness]. Evidence to that effect having been given by the lawyer, it seems to me that privilege must have been waived for those questions. And I think the interests of justice, which I believe to underlie the authorities on this part of the case, demand that the opposition and the court should have an opportunity to satisfy itself as to the accuracy of the evidence given to the lawyer as to the way in which he conducted the interview.' Mustill J drew a distinction at 140 between the instructions to the lawyer who carried out the questioning and the questions themselves; the instructions did not play a part in the meeting, did not form part of the body of events upon which the Court had to reach conclusions of fact, and were merely part of the prior history of those events. In R v Secretary of State for Transport; Ex parte Factortame (1997) 9 Admin LR 591 at 599, Auld LJ made the following observations concerning the application of the test stated in Nea Karteria : 'Much depends on whether the party making partial disclosure seeks to represent by so doing that the disclosed documents go to part or the whole of an ""issue in question"", the expression used by Mustill, J in the passage from his judgment in Nea Karteria that I have cited. The issue may be confined to what was said or done in a single transaction or it may be more complex than that and extend over a series of connected events or transactions. In each case the question for the court is whether the matters in issue and the document or documents in respect of which partial disclosure has been made are respectively severable so that the partially disclosed material clearly does not bear on matters in issue in respect of which material is withheld. The more confined the issue, for example as to the content of a single document or conversation, the more difficult it is likely to be to withhold, by severance, part of the document or other documents relevant to the document or conversation.' In Fulham Leisure Holdings Ltd v Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones [2006] 2 All ER 599 (' Fulham' ) at 604 [11], Mann J suggested that it was helpful to approach the application of the test stated in Nea Karteria in three steps: first, identify the transaction in respect of which the disclosure has been made; secondly, ascertain from the nature of the disclosure or other evidence whether the transaction is wider than an advice given on a single occasion, if so, the whole of the wider transaction must be disclosed; and thirdly, the disclosure of the whole transaction may make it plain that further disclosure is necessary to avoid unfairness or misunderstanding of what has been disclosed. Mann J added at 607 [18] that once the transaction has been identified the cases show that the whole of the material relevant to that transaction must be disclosed. It is not open to a waiving party to say that the transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose; the court will determine objectively what the real transaction is so that the scope of the waiver can be determined. His Lordship also said that the application of these principles will be very fact sensitive and will vary from case to case: at 607 [19]. WAIVER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED At [70] to [126] above, I set out my findings as to the precise terms in which AWB disclosed the results of its legal reviews and legal advice it had obtained to the Australian Government, the IIC and the Commission. Overall, I am satisfied that by means of these disclosures, AWB deployed the gist or substance of legal advice it had obtained. Moreover, I am satisfied that AWB made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice in its dealings with the Australian Government, the IIC and the Commission because it considered that it was in its commercial interests to do so. These actions are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the legal advice. Having regard to the nature, purpose, terms and extent of its disclosures, I am also satisfied that AWB acted inconsistently with the maintenance of confidentiality over the associated material which underpinned the legal advice. While these overall conclusions are relevant and important, I have taken the view that it is necessary and appropriate for me to make specific findings as to the nature and consequences of each such disclosure. I turn to that task. In his various statements to the Australian Government, Hargreaves did not merely refer to the existence of legal advice. Nor did he simply disclose the legal advice which had been obtained by AWB from Mr Tracey QC. He described in some detail the findings and conclusions that had been arrived at by AWB's own legal review. In my opinion, Hargreaves thereby disclosed to the Australian Government the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB had obtained (as at the relevant dates at which he made his disclosures) that there was no evidence of: &#8226; corruption by AWB &#8226; side payments or after sales payments by AWB to the former Iraqi regime &#8226; any knowledge on the part of AWB that Alia was connected with the Iraqi regime or that payments were being channelled by Alia to that regime &#8226; any conduct by AWB that resulted in breaches of the United Nations' sanctions &#8226; any other wrongdoing or improper conduct by AWB in connection with the supply of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme. When Hargreaves gave his briefings to officers of the Australian Government, he expressed himself in terms that were apt to refer, and which a reasonable listener would have understood as referring, to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that AWB had received as at the date of the relevant briefing. Hargreaves would not have been understood as referring only to a particular piece of historical advice, regardless of whether it was overtaken, or qualified, or supported by later advice. His assertions purported to represent the current state of affairs. Hargreaves' memorandum of 25 June 2005 makes it quite clear that his statements to the Australian Government were based upon all of the legal advice AWB had obtained, and not simply the advice it had obtained from Mr Tracey QC. It cannot be disputed that Hargreaves disclosed the substance of the legal advice which Blakes provided to AWB's board on 25 May 2004. AWB has already formed that view and acted on it by producing Blakes' power point presentation to the Commission. But in my view the consequence of Hargreaves' disclosures cannot be confined to Blakes' advice of 25 May 2004 and Mr Tracey QC's advices. Through the remainder of 2004 and until Hargreaves had his last meeting with Ms Carayanides in the period between 16 June 2005 and September 2005, Hargreaves met with Australian Government representatives several times and continued to make assertions that AWB's independent legal review had not identified any wrongdoing by AWB. The evidence shows that Blakes and Minters continued the legal review in 2004 and 2005 and provided ongoing legal advice to AWB. It is not open to a waiving party to say that the disclosures relate simply to one advice and not others, or that the relevant transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose; the Court will determine objectively what has been disclosed: see Fulham at 607 [18]. Hargreaves' memorandum of 25 June 2005 makes it plain that he deliberately deployed AWB's legal advice in his dealings with the Australian Government. He did so as part of AWB's strategy to secure the continued support of the Federal Government, both generally and in relation to AWB's dealings with the IIC and the United States Government. Hargreaves also deployed the advice in pursuit of the objectives that he set out in his memorandum; they included protecting and defending the reputation of AWB both within Australia and overseas, and minimising any attack by US wheat interests on AWB's position as the exclusive manager of wheat exports from Australia. Given these strategic objectives, it was important for AWB to disclose, indeed to stress, that it had conducted an extensive independent legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by AWB in connection with its exports of wheat to Iraq. By disclosing its legal advice to secure these objectives, AWB assumed the risk that it would be held to have waived legal professional privilege in connection with legal advices it obtained in the course of the legal review. Having regard to the legal principles governing waiver, I consider that any legal advice that AWB obtained from Blakes or Minters prior to Hargreaves' last meeting with Ms Carayanides on any of the subject matters, or relating to any of the issues, described at [180] above, has been waived by reason of the disclosures made by Hargreaves. Those subject matters and issues are wide enough to encompass the Tigris transaction and the iron filings claim. If AWB obtained legal advice during this period on those subject matters, or relating to those issues, from persons other than Blakes or Minters such as ABL, Mr Tracey QC or others, that advice has also been waived by Hargreaves' disclosures. I am satisfied that the disclosures to the IIC involved a disclosure by AWB of the gist or substance of legal advice that it had obtained by 28 February 2005. The disclosure occurred at two points. First, when Lindberg was interviewed on 28 February 2005, the interview took place in the presence of AWB's legal representative. AWB had the ability to object to any statements by Lindberg that intruded into areas covered by legal professional privilege. No objection was raised to Lindberg's statement that the legal review conducted by Cooper had found nothing that would substantiate claims of fraud or corruption by AWB or payments by AWB to individuals in the Government of Iraq. Secondly, AWB was directly involved in providing the record of interview, as revised by Lindberg and AWB's lawyers, to the IIC. In my opinion, the record of interview describes the gist or substance of legal advice which AWB had obtained as a result of its legal review. As with Hargreaves, Lindberg's assertions purported to describe the current state of affairs, ie, as at 28 February 2005. There is no reason to read his assertions as if they were confined to legal advice obtained from Mr Tracey QC. It extends, in my view, to any legal advice obtained by AWB from Blakes, Minters and Mr Tracey QC, and any advice from others, prior to 28 February 2005 that deals with the same subject matters or relates to the same issues as the advice that Lindberg described. I am satisfied that the disclosures to the IIC were made deliberately and consciously by AWB with a view to obtaining a finding from the IIC that AWB had not engaged, or at least had not knowingly engaged, in conduct that involved making payments to the Iraqi regime in breach of the United Nations' sanctions. Lindberg and AWB went out of their way to stress that the company had undertaken a legal review which had found nothing to substantiate claims of fraud, corruption or improper payments to the Iraqi regime. The disclosures were made with the knowledge and intention that they would be referred to by the IIC in its final published report. Accordingly, I find that AWB consciously and voluntarily deployed its legal advice with the object and intention of furthering the company's commercial and other interests. AWB contended that the disclosures which Lindberg made at his meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 4 October 2005 were confined to the advice given by Mr Tracey QC. This is a possible interpretation of the Department's minute, but in my view Lindberg's statements are not to be read, and would not have been understood, so narrowly. Later in the meeting, Lindberg said that AWB had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime and that this had been supported by legal advice. This statement was expressed broadly and was not confined to 'independent legal advice'. In my view, Lindberg disclosed, and a reasonable listener would have understood that Lindberg was disclosing, the gist or substance of all of the legal advice that AWB had obtained up to 4 October 2005 in relation to the question whether AWB had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime. The disclosure extends to Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of advice dated 22 September 2005 and Professor Wippman's advice dated 27 September 2005. At the meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lindberg, Stewart and other representatives of AWB were providing AWB's answer to the IIC's draft findings, as communicated to AWB in the IIC's letter of 26 September 2005. The minute shows that AWB's representatives were very concerned to explain AWB's claims of innocence and to secure the Government's ongoing support. Lindberg told the meeting that the IIC had ignored AWB's explanations and that the so-called evidence relied on by the IIC did not support its factual findings. In support of these contentions, Lindberg asserted that AWB had legal advice confirming that AWB had not acted in contravention of the sanctions regime. I infer that AWB made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice at the meeting with the Minister so as to secure the ongoing support of the Australian Government. In doing so, it assumed the risk of any consequential waiver of legal professional privilege. In my opinion, Blakes' presentation to AWB's board on 25 May 2004 constituted legal advice for the purposes of the doctrine of legal professional privilege. AWB withdrew its claim of privilege and produced the complete presentation to the Commissioner in April this year. The presentation not only discloses the substance of the legal advice from Blakes, but also some of its detail and foundations. In my opinion, one consequence of this disclosure is that AWB has waived privilege over any other legal advice that it obtained prior to 25 May 2004 in relation to the same subject matters or the same issues as Blakes addressed in its presentation. AWB contends that Lindberg's evidence to the Commission on 17 January 2006 did not disclose the gist or conclusion of any legal advice. I disagree. In my opinion, it disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB had previously obtained as to whether AWB had engaged in conduct in breach of the United Nations' sanctions and whether AWB had paid inland transportation fees to Alia as a conduit for the payment of money to the Iraqi regime. In the course of his evidence, Lindberg went out of his way to assert that the legal review that Cooper had instituted, assisted by external legal advisers, had reported periodically and did not find any evidence to substantiate the allegations that AWB had made payments in breach of the sanctions. In one instance at least, Lindberg's assertions to this effect were not directly responsive to the question asked of him by counsel assisting the Commission. Lindberg gave these answers in the presence of counsel for AWB without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. I am satisfied that, by means of this evidence, AWB voluntarily deployed the legal advice that it had obtained prior to 17 January 2006. I infer that it did so because it considered it was in its interests for it to be publicly known that AWB had conducted an extensive legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing. In his evidence, Lindberg specifically referred to a series of periodical reports from those undertaking the legal review: 'there were a number of reports, and the findings of those reports are recorded in the minutes and the basis of those findings has been communicated in letters that have been sent to the government and elsewhere'. I find that in his evidence to the Commission Lindberg was referring to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that AWB received during the course of the internal review as periodical reports were made to the boards of AWB and AWBI. It follows, in my view, that Lindberg's evidence has the consequence that AWB has waived privilege over any legal advice that it obtained in the course of the review that goes to the same subject matters, or relates to the same issues, as the legal advice that Lindberg described in the course of his evidence. In relation to Mr Tracey QC's advices, AWB produced his written advices of 8 June 2004, 31 March 2005 and 12 August 2005 to the Commission early in April 2006. In my view, the consequence of this production is that AWB must be taken to have waived legal professional privilege in any other legal advices that it obtained prior to Mr Tracey QC's last advice of 12 August 2005 in relation to the same subjects or issues. As already mentioned, I also consider that, quite separately, AWB has waived privilege over the advice it obtained from Mr Tracey QC on 22 September 2005 in relation to Resolution 661. As a result of the Project Water investigations, the directors of AWB obtained legal advice from Cooper at the board meeting on 14 December 2004 that the Tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches of law. A handwritten note of that advice has been produced to the Commission. AWB was entitled to claim that this note was protected from production to the Commission by legal professional privilege. It did not claim privilege. I infer that it did not do so because it wanted it to be known publicly that AWB had advice as of 14 December 2004 to the effect that the Tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches by AWB. Having disclosed the gist or substance of its legal advice in this manner, it would be inconsistent to allow AWB to maintain confidentiality and privilege in any other legal advices that AWB obtained prior to 14 December 2004 dealing with the same subject matter or the same issues. The advice that Cooper gave to AWB's board on 14 December 2004 related specifically to the Tigris transaction. However, I consider that the other disclosures that I have already discussed were expressed in such broad terms that they encompassed any advices concerning the Tigris transaction and/or the iron filings claim. As a result, I consider that there has been a waiver of other advices about the Tigris transaction, such as Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of 26 October 2004 (document 353A). The cumulative effect of AWB's disclosures is that, down to 17 January 2006 when Lindberg gave evidence to the Commission, AWB was openly claiming that its legal advice showed that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with its supply of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme, including wrongdoing of the kind described at [180] above. I find that AWB made these claims to advance its commercial interests. AWB's conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in any advices dealing with the same subjects or issues. In addition, Lindberg, Cooper and Scales gave evidence to the Commission that AWB obtained legal advice that the proceeds of the inflated prices in contracts A1670 and A1680 should be disbursed to Tigris to the extent of approximately US$7 million. That evidence was given in the presence of AWB's legal representatives without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. Again, I infer that AWB was content for it to be publicly known that it had obtained that legal advice. Having disclosed the gist or substance of that advice, AWB is bound to disclose any other legal advices it obtained in relation to the same subject or same issue. AWB's revised list of privileged documents contains several advices relating to the Tigris payment. They include documents 337 and 385. Documents 1088, 1089, 1092, 1093 and 1094 record the substance of those advices in minutes of meetings held by the AWB and AWBI boards in December 2004 and February 2005 and the chairman's running sheets for the February 2005 meetings. The evidence which Lindberg, Cooper and Scales gave in public before the Commission is inconsistent with AWB's attempt to maintain privilege in these documents. One question which remains to be dealt with is whether the scope of the waiver that must, in my view, be imputed to AWB is to be confined to any other legal advice that AWB obtained prior to the date of the relevant disclosures that addressed the same subject matters or issues as the advice that AWB voluntarily disclosed. In my opinion, the waiver is not so confined. It extends to the documents and information which were taken into account in formulating, or which otherwise underpinned or influenced, the legal advice that AWB has chosen to disclose. The Commonwealth argued that AWB's disclosures are broad enough to encompass any legal advice which AWB obtained, and any documents which AWB's lawyers reviewed or created, in the course of the Project Rose and Project Water investigations. The difficulty with this way of approaching the boundaries of the waiver of associated material is that the terms 'Project Rose' and 'Project Water' have an indefinite and imprecise ambit. According to the authorities discussed above, the limits of any waiver of associated material depend upon the nature of the advice that has been disclosed, what was represented by means of the disclosure, and the character of the transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice. Regard must also be had to the way in which AWB's legal advice was described in the various disclosures. Essentially, by means of the disclosures, AWB was asserting that a detailed legal review had been undertaken, and that it had concluded that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing or other improper conduct by AWB in connection with its sale of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme. In my opinion, the nature and character of this disclosure is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in those documents which were taken into account by AWB's legal advisers in arriving at the advice they gave. To adapt the language used by McClellan CJ at Common Law in Thomas at [17] and [20], AWB's disclosures of its legal advice effect a waiver of privilege in the documents which were reviewed for the purposes of that advice or which influenced its content. Furthermore, AWB emphasised the breadth of its internal review in its various disclosures. In my view, AWB thereby waived privilege in documents which define the scope of the review or which reveal what investigations were in fact undertaken in the course of the review. Much the same answer follows if one asks what was the legal exercise or transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice: see Factortame at 598-599; and Fulham at 604 [11] and 607 [18]. Having regard to the form of the legal advice disclosed by AWB, the relevant legal exercise or transaction encompassed a review of original documents and witness interviews, as well as summaries, chronologies or other analytical documents prepared by the lawyers, with a view to determining whether there was any improper or wrongful conduct by AWB. Material of this kind underpinned or influenced the legal advice which AWB has chosen to disclose, and it is not severable from that advice. There is a certain symmetry in defining the boundaries of the waiver of associated material in this way. Documents brought into existence in the course of a lawyer's factual investigation are, prima facie, capable of attracting legal professional privilege where the investigation is being undertaken for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice. If the client voluntarily discloses the gist or substance of the legal advice that is founded upon such investigations, the rationale for according privilege to the investigative material will have disappeared. While I would go further, the approach that I have described is not unlike the approach that AWB has already taken in connection with the production to the Commission of Mr Tracey QC's memoranda of advice and instructions. In the case of Mr Tracey QC's oral advice of 25 May 2004 and his confirmatory memorandum of 12 August 2005, AWB determined, correctly in my view, that the underlying documents supplied to Mr Tracey QC must also be produced. AWB considered that the form of Mr Tracey QC's advice (ie there was no evidence of wrongdoing) meant that it was impossible to separate his legal advice from the copy documents that were supplied to him as part of his instructions. The evidence before me does not reveal whether AWB adopted the same approach to Mr Tracey QC's advice of 31 March 2005. When he was asked to provide this advice, copy documents were supplied to Mr Tracey QC as part of his instructions but there is no evidence, one way or the other, as to whether those copy documents have been produced to the Commission. The substance of Mr Tracey QC's advice was that nothing in the documents supplied to him as of 31 March 2005 had caused him to vary his earlier advice of 25 May 2004. This advice cannot be separated from the documents that were supplied to him and, accordingly, AWB's express waiver of privilege in his advice extends to all of the documents and instructions supplied to him. The applicable principle can also be illustrated by reference to the advice that Blakes gave in its presentation of 25 May 2004. The advice that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by AWB that involved a breach of the United Nations' sanctions was explicitly founded upon a review of a large number of documents and interviews of AWB personnel. Having regard to the form of its advice, it is impossible to separate Blakes' advice from the underlying documentation and interviews. However, the witness interviews and other materials that Blakes relied upon to formulate its advice have not been produced to the Commission and are still the subject of claims for legal professional privilege. In my opinion, those claims of privilege are not maintainable; privilege has been waived by (inter alia) the production of Blakes' advice. The same approach must be adopted to any advices that Blakes provided after 25 May 2004 on the question whether any evidence had emerged of any wrongdoing or improper conduct on the part of AWB. Another question which remains to be dealt with is the extent of any waiver that arises from AWB's production to the Commission of the instructions to Sir Anthony Mason. In its particulars setting forth its objections to AWB's privilege claims, the Commonwealth contended that these disclosures had brought about a waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to Project Rose. It tendered the instructions which ABL provided to Sir Anthony Mason on 16 September and 20 October 2005 and the expert opinion which Sir Anthony Mason provided dated 24 October 2005. However, the Commonwealth did not direct any submissions to this aspect of its waiver case, either orally or in its written submissions. Nor did AWB address any oral or written submissions to the consequences which flowed from its production to the Commission of the instructions to, and the advice obtained from, Sir Anthony Mason. It must be borne in mind that AWB is seeking a declaration that all of the documents set forth in its revised list of privileged documents are the subject of legal professional privilege. These documents include documents by which AWB obtained legal advice both in Australia and in the United States concerning the applicability of Resolution 661. The instructions to Sir Anthony Mason summarised the gist or substance of the very same legal advice. In these circumstances, I have concluded that the Court must take account of the evidence that has been placed before it. By disclosing the instructions given to Sir Anthony Mason, AWB has in my opinion disclosed the substance of legal advice it had obtained, as at 20 October 2005, both in Australia and in the United States, as to the applicability of Resolution 661. This disclosure encompasses Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of 22 September 2005 and Professor Wippman's advice of 27 September 2005. Thus far, I have identified the principles which define the boundaries of the waiver that is to be imputed to AWB, including the boundaries of any waiver of associated material. The remaining task in disposing of the waiver arguments is to determine precisely what documents fall within these boundaries. I have carried out that task by inspecting the documents over which claims of privilege have been made, reviewing the evidence concerning each document, and applying the principles identified above. As a result, I have determined that AWB has waived any legal professional privilege that would otherwise attach to the documents as listed under the heading 'Conclusions' below. THE IRON FILINGS CLAIM Communications between a lawyer and client which facilitate a crime or fraud are not protected by legal professional privilege. This principle is often referred to as the 'fraud exception' to legal professional privilege, but this does not capture its full reach: Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500 (' Kearney' ) at 515; Propend at 546; Clements, Dunne &amp; Bell Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (2001) 188 ALR 515 (' Clements' ) at 521-522 [30]. The principle encompasses a wide species of fraud, criminal activity or actions taken for illegal or improper purposes: see North J's review of the authorities in Clements at 522-526 [35]-[44]. The scope of conduct caught by the principle has been articulated in a variety of ways, often without particular precision: Propend at 545. Classic formulations have spoken of communications in furtherance of a 'crime or fraud': R v Cox and Railton (1884) 14 QBD 153 (' R v Cox' ) at 165; a 'criminal or unlawful proceeding': Bullivant v Attorney-General (Vic) [1901] AC 196 (' Bullivant' ) at 201; 'any unlawful or wicked act': Annesley v Anglesea (1743) 17 St Tr 1139 at 1229; and 'all forms of fraud and dishonesty such as fraudulent breach of trust, fraudulent conspiracy, trickery, and sham contrivances': Crescent Farm (Sidcup) Sports Ltd v Sterling Offices Ltd [1972] Ch 553 at 565. In Kearney , the High Court applied the principle to deny legal professional privilege to legal advice obtained by the Northern Territory Government which was prima facie a 'deliberate abuse of statutory power' to defeat a land claim under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth). In his reasons for judgment, Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason and Brennan JJ agreed) stated at 515 that 'legal professional privilege will be denied to a communication which is made for the purpose of frustrating the processes of the law itself, even though no crime or fraud is contemplated.' Some authorities have expressed the principle as applicable to prevent a 'fraud on justice' in a broad sense. The concept of a 'fraud on justice' was adopted by Lander J in Gartner v Carter [2004] FCA 258 (' Gartner v Carter' ) to deny protection to a communication between a lawyer and client for the purpose of the client putting assets beyond the reach of the legitimate claims of secured creditors: at [130] and [139]-[140]. The principle extends to 'trickery' and 'shams'. A 'sham' refers to steps which take the form of a legally effective transaction but which the parties intend should not have the apparent, or any, legal consequences: Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471; see also Beazley v Steinhardt (1999) 106 A Crim R 21; affirmed on appeal in [1999] FCA 1255 (' Beazley' ). The recent case of Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Mercorella (No 3) [2006] FCA 772 provides an example of the denial of legal professional privilege to documents in furtherance of a sham transaction. In that case, creditors of a managed investment scheme claimed privilege over documents relating to securities obtained from the defendant and certain companies in the scheme. The transactions were allegedly entered into so as to advance those creditors' interests over the interests of other creditors to the scheme. Mansfield J found that the communications were prima facie in furtherance of a sham and, as such, were not privileged. After referring to Lander J's decision in Gartner v Carter and Barclays Bank plc v Eustice [1995] 4 All ER 511 (' Barclays Bank '), his Honour stated at [95]: 'It is a short step from those decisions to the present facts, as prima facie found. The [creditors] engaged in the transactions reflected in the Deed, and the granting of the securities within the structures it created, to secure or advance their interests over others who had advanced money to [the first defendant] or to the Scheme. There is a prima facie case that the ""restructure"" of the advances so that they appear as advances to the partnership of Ajay and Opey is a sham.' Mansfield J drew a distinction at [96]-[100] between communications to obtain advice in relation to what, if anything, could lawfully be done to improve the prospects of being repaid or of obtaining the interest to which the client was entitled (which were privileged), and communications which have the effect of concealing the true nature of a transaction and which enable a client to present a picture which is not true (which were not privileged). Where a client is engaged in fraudulent conduct, communications with his or her lawyer in furtherance of the fraud are not privileged, regardless of whether the lawyer is a party to the fraud or not: Clements at 562 [213]. The principle applies to communications passing between a client and lawyer where the lawyer is innocent of the fraud or improper purpose: R v Bell; Ex parte Lees [1980] HCA 26 ; (1980) 146 CLR 141 at 145. Further, the fraud need not be that of the client or the lawyer; it may be that of a third party: Capar v Commissioner of Police (1994) 34 NSWLR 715; R v Central Criminal Court; Ex parte Francis &amp; Francis [1989] AC 346, cited with approval in Clements at 562-565 [217]-[218]. It is important to bear in mind that the fraud exception is based on public policy grounds. The principle is sufficiently flexible to capture a range of situations where the protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client would be contrary to the public interest: see Kearney at 514-515; R v Cox at 614. This aspect of the principle is reflected in the statement that '[t]he privilege takes flight if the relationship between lawyer and client is abused': Clark v United States (1933) 289 US 1 at 15; see also Kearney at 514 and 524. In Barclays Bank , communications between the client and his lawyer in relation to the setting up of transactions at an undervalue so as to prejudice the bank were held to be 'sufficiently iniquitous for public policy' to require those communications to be discoverable. Schiemann LJ (with whom Aldous and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed) stated at 524: 'If that view be correct, then it matters not whether either the client or the solicitor shared that view. They may well have thought that the transactions would not fall to be set aside ... either because they thought that the transactions were not at an undervalue or because they thought that the court would not find that the purpose of the transactions was to prejudice the bank. But if this is what they thought then there is a strong prima facie case that they were wrong. Public policy does not require the communications of those who misapprehend the law to be privileged in circumstances where no privilege attaches to those who correctly understand the situation.' For the principle to apply, there must be more than a mere assertion or allegation of fraud or impropriety: Bullivant at 201, 203 and 204-205. In Propend at 514, Brennan CJ expressed the test as being one of 'reasonable grounds for believing' that the relevant communication was for an improper purpose. The requirement has also been described as one of a 'prima facie case': Butler v Board of Trade [1971] 1 Ch 680 (' Butler' ) at 689; cf Baker v Evans (1987) 77 ALR 565 at 574. In Kearney at 516, Gibbs CJ approved the test formulated in O'Rourke v Darbishire [1920] AC 581 at 604, namely that 'there must be something to give colour to the charge'; 'the statement must be made in clear and definite terms, and there must further be some prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact'. The High Court in Propend applied this test: at 514 per Brennan CJ, at 521 per Dawson J, 534 per Toohey J, 546 per Gaudron J, 556 per McHugh J, and 592 per Kirby J. It is not necessary to prove an improper purpose on the balance of probabilities. The 'prima facie' test arguably reflects the fact that issues of legal professional privilege are usually dealt with in the interlocutory stages of a proceeding, but the authorities have not departed from that formulation where a declaration is sought in relation to privilege issues: Butler ; Propend; Beazley . It must also be established, on the same prima facie basis, that the communication which is the subject of the claim for privilege was made in furtherance of, or as a step preparatory to, the commission of the fraud or wrongdoing. In Butler, Goff J found at 687 that a letter written by the plaintiff's lawyer which volunteered a warning that the plaintiff may incur serious consequences if he did not take care was not shown to be 'in preparation for or in furtherance of or as part of any criminal designs on the part of the plaintiff': see also Zemanek v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (unreported, Federal Court, Hill J, 2 October 1997). In Propend , the High Court considered whether a charge of improper purpose must be based on evidence that is admissible in the proceeding. The only evidence of alleged illegality before the trial judge in Propend was the sworn information which supported the issue of a search warrant for the relevant documents. The Court held that, while the sworn information was admissible to establish the basis upon which the warrant was issued, it was not admissible to show that the copy documents were not privileged: see at 514 per Brennan CJ, 557 per McHugh J, 576 per Gummow J, 547 per Gaudron J, and 593 per Kirby J. The iron filings claim refers to a claim by GBI for a rebate of US$2,016,133.00 on account of the fact that earlier shipments of wheat by AWB to GBI had been contaminated by iron filings. Lindberg agreed to pay this sum to GBI in settlement of the iron filings claim in about October 2002 during the course of a visit to Bagdad. An email dated 7 November 2002 from Chris Whitwell of AWB ('Whitwell') to Lindberg and others reporting on the trip to Iraq in October 2002 stated that the responsible Iraqi Minister had asked for repayment of the iron filings rebate through the 'inland transport mechanism'. The same email referred to the fact that the Iraqi Minister was seeking cabinet approval for repayment of the Tigris debt. At the outset of this case, the Commonwealth contended that any legal advice that AWB obtained in connection with the Tigris transaction was waived by virtue of AWB's production to the Commission of a partly masked memorandum of 7 February 2003 dealing with the subject of the iron filings payment and Tigris petroleum fee. On the first day of the hearing, AWB announced that it was no longer seeking a declaration of privilege in respect of documents connected with the Tigris transaction which the Commonwealth sought to challenge on the basis of the fraud exception. Subsequently, AWB made it clear that this concession did not extend to six documents relating to the iron filings rebate payment. During the course of the hearing in this Court, AWB produced an unmasked copy of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 and provided it to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth tendered the memorandum as an exhibit in this proceeding, without any objection from AWB. The memorandum contains a fairly full description of the way in which AWB planned to pay the iron filings claim to GBI. The memorandum, which was sent by Whitwell to Messrs Geary and Long, with copies to Scales, Johnson, Hogan, Johnstone, Cooper, Lyons, Hockey and Thomas, states: ' PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL This memo is in respect to refunding the Grain Board of Iraq the quality rebate of approx USD 2,016,133 through the inland transport payments for the new contract as requested by the Minister of Trade, Iraq. In addition, for the record IS &amp; M has negotiated (through an uplift in price] the recovery of a USD 8.375 million outstanding debt to Tigris by IGB through this contract. AWB will repay this debt back to Tigris less an agreed recovery fee of USD 500 K on a pro rata basis as tonnage is shipped. Overview Delegation led by Andrew Lindberg (August 2002) to Baghdad agreed to settle the contamination of the 'Iron Filings' vessels by paying them USD 6 pmt for each vessel total = USD 2,016,133 After being approached by Tigris Petroleum AWB and IGB have agreed to allow the new contract to be the conduit for a repayment of USD 8,375,000 owed to Tigris by IGB for a cargo of wheat shipped in 1996. IGB have agreed to raising the contract price by the debt amount and when payments are made under the Letter of Credit AWB will pay Tigris its debt less AWBs recovery fee. We have suggested the following during our last two visits. &#8226; Offsetting the debt against the Outstanding debt to 'Tigris petroleum' (approx USD 8.35 million) &#8226; Reducing the any new contract price [sic] by the amount of the rebate on a pmt basis &#8226; Repaying the debt through the provision of aid in some form - Wheat, Health supplies etc. However, in discussion with the Minister of Trade he has continually , insisted on repayment directly as an addition to the inland transport and said that this was his understanding of the agreement with Andrew Lindberg - Michael Long was present and confirms that this was discussed. Now that the new contract has been concluded ISM need a sign off to organise this payment when shipments start. Issues &#8226; Possible implications for AWB on a corporate governance basis ie/ direct payment to a company with links to the Iraqi regime may be construed to be in contravention of the UN Sanctions. The relevant UN Security Council Resolution is 661 (1990). This resolution provides at clause 4: ""...All States shall not make available to the Government of Iraq or to any commercial, industrial or public utility undertaking in Iraq any funds or any other financial or economic resources and shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territories from removing from their territories or otherwise making available to that Government or to any such undertaking any such funds or resources and from remitting any other funds to persons or bodies within Iraq.... except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs."" In summary, this means that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be obliged to prevent AWB Limited from making any remittance of funds to the IGB. AWB Legal opinion in this regard is set out below. This does not mean, however, that a payment might not be able to be made which will comply with the terms of the UN Resolutions. As a minimum, if AWB management determines to make the payment, then it should be made in the following circumstances: 1. The payment is made in installments over time and coincides with payments for future shipments of wheat (ie not a lump sum payment); 2. The payments preferably be made to a company other than the IGB and in a jurisdiction other than Iraq; and 3. The payments be recorded as being made as a part of a settlement reached between AWB and IGB, the terms of which contemplated that IGB would agree not to take any action against AWB for the alleged contamination of the 8 vessels in 2002 with iron filings AND would agree to enter into contracts for the purchase of Australian bulk wheat in the future in exchange for a renegotiation of the price on the 8 vessels. If we ensure that the above requirements are met, then Legal consider it will be at least arguable that we are not 'making funds or financial resources available to the Iraqi Government'. Instead, we are repaying part of the contract price for the 8 vessels following a re-negotiation of the sale price due to a downgrading of the grain (which potentially contained iron filings). In addition to the above the UN Security Council resolutions also require (resolution 986 (1995) clause 8) that the cost of food exports to Iraq must be met by draw down from the UN ""escrow account"". Furthermore draw down from the escrow account is only allowable under strict conditions. Those conditions include, at clause 8(a)(iii) that the goods to which payment is referable shall have arrived in Iraq. In this case, the goods have already arrived in Iraq and HAVE been paid for in full. However, the Resolutions are SILENT on the procedure for any repayment of part of the price in circumstances where there has been a quality complaint (and a subsequent renegotiation of price). This may therefore give us more scope to make the repayment to IGB. Even if we make payment as outlined above, there is still a risk that the Australian Government and/or the United Nations will take a contrary view on the interpretation of the above mentioned resolutions and declare that AWB has breached the terms of those resolutions by making the payment. This is a commercial and political issue, which AWB's management will need to consider. &#8226; According to an informal discussion with DFAT any repayment of a quality rebate should be either re-payed through UN ESCROW account or as a contract price reduction however they have not had a full legal argument put in front of them or been told officially. In Public affairs opinion as long as the repayment is legal and could not be seen to be breaking UN Sanctions then we should proceed (with the proviso that we have an independent legal opinion to that effect - see above legal opinion). Public Affairs also expressed concern that this would not be well received by the UN OIP office and that there was a reasonable chance of them finding out. IS &amp; M on the other hand do not want them involved and feel confident that this issue could be handled without the need for the OIP to be consulted. It has been articulated to us and we have circumstantial evidence that other participants in the OIP program (Russian and Pakistani companies) have had to sort out quality problems in a similar way and it is unlikely either their national governments or the OIP were consulted &#8226; IS &amp; M feel strongly that a failure to repay the IGB as discussed will lead to serious consequences for AWBs relationship with the IGB. IS &amp; M also believe that failure to refund this agreed debt in this way would have serious implications for the execution of the new contracts. AWBI are aware of all the issues laid out above and in light of the commercial imperative of this situation agree with the recommendation as laid out below. They do however insist that the Managing Director is appraised of the situation. Actions Whilst IS &amp; M have received a number of different opinions from different areas of AWB and an informal opinion from DFAT we still feel this issue is a grey area with no prescriptive answers. Based on the opinions we do have and the commercial circumstances surrounding this issue IS &amp; M recommend and seek approval for the following: &#8226; IS &amp; M is to repay debt as per method outlined in AWBs legal opinion (and requested by the Minister of Trade) directly to Alia Transport in Jordan in instalments. IS &amp; M will also look to obtain written agreement from IGB to the payment in the format agreed by legal however it is not guaranteed. &#8226; Managing Director only to convey our intentions to the Australian Government at the appropriate time prior to Shipment. The timing of such a disclosure is important and we would recommend that nothing be done until at least Letters of Credit are in place for these contracts. Given that this is unlikely to happen until after a war with Iraq it may allow us a further chance of renegotiation with a new regime. &#8226; IS &amp; M to finalise as soon as possible a written agreement with Tigris with regard to the settlement of their debt.' [Original emphasis omitted] The evidence before me establishes to the requisite prima facie standard that the price in contracts A1670 and A1680 was inflated to cover both the amount of the iron filings claim and the repayment by GBI of the debt which it owed to Tigris. A surcharge of US$8.375 pmt was added to each contract in respect of the Tigris debt, as shown by an email from Nigel Edmonds-Wilson to Scales and others at AWB dated 12 December 2002. The same email shows that in each contract the inland transportation fee was set at US$51.15 pmt. At the Commission, Mr Geary of AWB gave evidence that the prices in these two contracts were inflated to cover a component for the Tigris debt and a component for the US$2 million iron filings rebate. He also said that the United Nations was not advised at any stage that the prices for wheat in these two contracts had been inflated in this way so as to cover the Tigris debt and the iron filings claim. To adopt the words of Viscount Finlay in O'Rourke , the evidence gives ample 'colour to the charge' that the prices in these two contracts were falsely misrepresented. The evidence shows that the prices in the two wheat contracts were inflated as a means of extracting money from the United Nations' escrow account. Having regard to the terms of the memorandum of 7 February 2003, there are reasonable grounds for believing that, having extracted approximately US$2 million from the escrow account to meet the iron filings claim, AWB planned to pay that money in instalments to GBI via the mechanism of inland transportation fees. The material before me, including Whitwell's email of 7 November 2002 and his memorandum of 7 February 2003, indicates clearly that AWB knew that paying inland transportation fees to Alia was a means of making payments to the Iraqi Government. This plan was concealed from the United Nations. The planned payments of the iron filings claim were never carried into effect because the invasion of Iraq intervened. Scales gave evidence to the Commission that the iron filings money has never been paid and remains in AWBI's accounts. However, the fact that the payments were never made to the GBI will not prevent the application of the fraud exception so long as there is sufficient evidence that the communications were in furtherance of, or preparatory to, the commission of the fraud or impropriety in the broad sense described above: see Butler; and Clements at 562 [213]. In my view, the evidence establishes a more than adequate prima facie case that AWB knowingly and deliberately disguised the true nature of the prices in contracts A1670 and A1680. If it be relevant, I also consider that the evidence establishes the foregoing matters on the balance of probabilities and to a level of satisfaction commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation: see Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362 per Dixon J. No question arises here of evidence which would not be admissible in a final hearing: cf Propend . AWB argued that there was no evidence that the transaction furthered any particular fraud, iniquity or illegality. It submitted that it is common ground that the United Nations' resolutions were not in terms incorporated into Australian law. AWB submitted that, consequently, the fraud exception is not available to take the documents out of the operation of the doctrine of legal professional privilege. This narrow approach is at odds with the authorities that stress the wide range of fraudulent or iniquitous activities that fall within the principle. I have inspected the six documents that were said to relate to the iron filings claim. My inspection of AWB's documents revealed a further four documents that fall within this category and are still the subject of a privilege claim. I am satisfied that these 10 documents are not privileged. The documents were, prima facie, brought into existence in furtherance of an improper and dishonest purpose, viz inflating the prices of contracts A1670 and A1680 so as to extract payments out of the United Nations' escrow account that would then be utilised, in part, to satisfy a compensation claim by GBI. Prima facie, the evidence establishes that the transaction was deliberately and dishonestly structured by AWB so as to misrepresent the true nature and purpose of the trucking fees and to work a trickery on the United Nations. It would be contrary to public policy for the privilege to enure in communications of this kind. The 10 documents in question are listed below in my conclusions. There is an alternative basis for rejecting AWB's claim for privilege over the 10 iron filings documents. AWB's disclosure of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 and its tender by the Commonwealth as an exhibit in these proceedings, without any objection or claim to confidentiality by AWB, effects a waiver over the subject matter of the legal advice set out in the memorandum. My inspection of the 10 documents relating to the iron filings claim confirms my view that those documents relate to the subjects and issues that are canvassed in the memorandum of 7 February 2003. If, contrary to my view, any privilege subsisted in any of the documents, it has been waived by AWB. When the Commonwealth tendered the unmasked version of the memorandum of 7 February 2003, I asked Mr Judd why AWB's production of that document did not waive any privilege that subsisted in documents relating to the iron filings claim. Mr Judd's response was that the Commonwealth did not put its case on that basis. I do not think that is entirely correct. In the particulars of its case, the Commonwealth contended that AWB's disclosure of the masked version of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 worked a waiver of any privilege in documents relating to Project Water and the Tigris transaction. The Commonwealth has never varied from the position that the iron filings claim was an integral part of the Tigris transaction. However, the Commonwealth did not in its closing address make any submission that privilege over the six documents had been waived by the production of the unmasked memorandum. To that extent, Mr Judd's response was correct. Despite these matters, I have concluded that the Court cannot ignore the effect of the evidence before it, especially as AWB is seeking a declaration that the 10 documents are privileged. CONCLUSIONS It is not feasible in these reasons for judgment, when so many documents are at issue, to set out separate reasons for the decision I have reached on each particular document. I have reached the conclusions set forth hereunder after inspecting all of the documents in AWB's revised list of privileged documents and by applying the legal principles and factual findings identified above. AWB has not made out its claim for privilege in respect of the following documents: 229, 245-247, 279, 280, 362B, 469A, 495, 542, 565, 586, 675, 784, 867, 872, 890AN, 1090, 1091, 1095, 1096, 1098, 1099, 1118 and 1262. These documents fall into the following categories : (a) documents for which there is no evidence of purpose to satisfy the dominant purpose test (documents 229, 469A, 542 and 565); (b) documents where the evidence does not satisfy the dominant purpose test, having regard to the nature and content of the document and the vague and formulaic evidence contained in the relevant segments of the affidavit evidence (documents 279, 280, 495, 675, 784, 867, 872, 890AN, 1095, 1096, 1098, 1099, 1118 and 1262); (c) a document that was provided to a third party and therefore was not a confidential communication for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice (document 362B); (d) documents which are partly not proven and partly waived (documents 245-247, 586, 1090, 1091 which are discussed further below). If, contrary to my view, privilege does attach to any of these documents, there has been a waiver of privilege in respect of all of them, other than documents 362B, 784, 872 and 1118. The waived documents are included in the list at [237] below. In addition, there are 10 documents relating to the iron filings claims. They are as follows: 30, 31, 32, 32A, 33, 41, 594, 595, 595A and 596. Privilege does not attach to these documents as they were brought into existence in furtherance of a fraud or other impropriety. Alternatively, any privilege has been waived by AWB. These documents are included in the list at [237] below. AWB has waived any legal professional privilege that subsisted in the following documents: 12, 301-33, 41, 56, 77-79, 81-85, 100-106, 110-117, 120-124, 126, 127, 129-132, 136, 137, 139, 140, 161, 213, 229, 235, 240, 241, 245-247, 250, 252, 253, 257-259, 263, 265-268, 271, 279, 280, 283, 284, 290, 292, 294-301, 308-310, 313, 326, 327, 330-333, 335A-342, 344, 348, 353A, 355-357, 359, 361, 362A, 365, 375, 377-380, 385, 386, 394, 422, 423, 424, 425, 432, 443, 445-449, 455, 461, 463, 465, 469A, 486, 487, 495, 507, 508, 513, 523, 524, 533, 534, 541-544, 547, 548, 553-555, 557, 563, 565, 568-579, 582-590, 592, 594-596, 599, 601-603, 675, 681, 681A, 689A, 689B, 699-704D, 704J-704P, 704T, 704X, 704AA, 704FF, 704KK, 711-715, 721, 722, 725, 729-733, 736-739, 749, 753, 755-757, 762, 771, 788, 794, 798, 815, 817, 820, 823, 824, 837, 840, 847, 867, 890AA, 890AD, 890AE, 890AH, 890AI, 890AJ, 890AK, 890AM, 890AN, 890AP, 890AQ, 1005, 1006, 1009, 1011-1013, 1025, 1026, 1028-1030, 1032, 1033, 1051, 1056, 1059, 1070, 1088-1096, 1098, 1099, 1119- 1121, 1123, 1124, 1144-1152, 1161-1163, 1183-1187, 1221, 1222, 1262 and 1297. In broad terms, the documents over which privilege has been waived comprise documents falling within the following categories: documents which define the scope of AWB's internal review or which identify what investigations were carried out; summaries, chronologies and other documents which record or analyse the results of those investigations; witness statements and other notes or records of interviews of AWB personnel; records of meetings and periodical reports concerning the findings of the review; and documents seeking advice, or comprising or recording advice provided to AWB, as to whether AWB or any of its employees engaged in wrongdoing in connection with wheat sales to Iraq under the OFF Programme, including any wrongdoing in connection with the Tigris transaction. As I have explained, waiver does not turn on whether the documents attracted the description 'Project Rose' or 'Project Water'. On inspection, I determined that numerous documents marked 'Re: Project Rose' or the equivalent fall outside the scope of any waiver as they related to distinct matters about which AWB sought or obtained legal advice, such as the powers and jurisdiction of the PSI and IIC investigators, other US legal issues, the memorandum of understanding between the IIC and AWB, representation of AWB employees at IIC hearings, the powers of the Wheat Export Authority, and issues of directors' and officers' insurance and corporate governance. There are a number of documents where, on inspection, I have determined that the document is only capable of attracting privilege as to part (the balance of the claim for privilege not having been proved), but that such privilege has been waived. These documents require some further explanation: (a) Documents 245 and 246 are drafts of an information paper dated 13 August 2004. Document 247 substantially replicates the draft information paper in a power point presentation format. AWB claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents, as indicated on the face of the documents. In substance, AWB contended that these parts attracted privilege because they recorded legal advice. On inspection I concluded that the claim is not established in respect of the first part of the documents. I have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but AWB has waived privilege in respect of that second part. (b) Document 586 is a table of various legal advices in the possession of Blakes. AWB contended that the table recorded legal advice. On inspection I concluded that this claim is not sustainable , save for the entries listed at 23, 24 and 25 of the table which disclose the substance of legal advice given by Mr Tracey QC. I have determined that AWB has waived privilege in respect of entries 23, 24 and 25 of the table. (c) Documents 1090 and 1091 are, respectively, the minutes of AWB and AWBI board meetings dated 22 February 2005. AWB claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents, as indicated on the face of the documents. It contended that these parts recorded legal advice. As to the first part claimed, this is not borne out by my inspection. I have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but AWB has waived privilege in respect of that second part. There are also a number of documents which I have determined to be privileged only as to part of the claim made by AWB. After inspecting the documents and applying the principles I have discussed, I have determined that certain parts of the documents are privileged, while privilege in another part or parts of the documents has not been proved or it has been waived. It is necessary to deal with each of these documents: (a) Document 138 contains three pages of handwritten file notes. Privilege has not been established in respect of the first page of the document. If (contrary to my view) privilege is attracted, it has been waived. Privilege is established in respect of the second page of the document. Privilege has not been established in respect of the third page of the document; or if privilege is attracted, contrary to my view, it has been waived. (b) Document 251 is a document consisting of a number of entries in a spreadsheet. AWB claims privilege in certain parts of the document, as indicated on the face of the document. AWB has waived privilege in respect of the parts claimed on pages 367, 368, 380, 390, and the first of the two parts claimed on each of pages 388 and 395. The page numbering refers to the system that AWB has adopted for its document control purposes. Otherwise, the document attracts privilege to the extent claimed. (c) Document 376 is a handwritten file note headed 'Iraq Report for JIS'. I have determined that the document attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document that relates to the Tigris transaction, namely the second entry commencing with the words 'completion of Iraq mkt. access arrangements' and concluding with the words 'confirm there is compliance'. (d) Documents 503, 520, 522, 526, 527 and 965 contain various drafts of a briefing paper initially prepared by ABL. I have determined that each of the documents attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of each document under the headings 'Legal Review' and 'Key Messages'. (e) Document 516 is another draft of the briefing paper referred to in the preceding subparagraph. I have determined that the document attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document under the heading 'Legal Review'. (f) Document 691 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal AWB employees and external lawyers. AWB said that the document attracted privilege in part. Dr Fuller gave evidence that it recorded legal advice of Leonie Thompson. I have determined that the passage on page 028 of the document opposite the entry 'Leonie T' is privileged. As to the remainder of the document, it does not record any legal advice and is not privileged. (g) Document 696 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal AWB employees and external lawyers. AWB claimed that the document was part privileged, and relied on Dr Fuller's evidence that it recorded legal advice given by Leon Zwier. I have determined that the passage on page 037 of the document opposite the heading 'Leon Zwier' (to the balance of the page) is privileged. Privilege has not been established in respect of the remainder of the document. If any privilege attached to the remainder, it has been waived. (h) Document 704S is a record of various matters discussed between AWB's external and internal lawyers. I have determined that AWB has waived privilege over the six lines commencing with the entry which includes the words 'iron filings case'. The balance of the document is privileged. (i) Document 704II is a handwritten record of various conversations on 20 and 28 September 2004. On the face of the document, it appears that a claim for privilege is made only over the part of the document which is dated 28 September 2004. Privilege has been established over the entry dated 28 September 2004. However the evidence of Ms Peavey in relation to document 704II addresses the entry of 20 September 2004. If privilege is claimed over the part of the document which is dated 20 September 2004, it has not been established. (j) Document 1097 is the minutes of a meeting of the AWB and AWBI joint board committee. There are two parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made on the ground that they record legal advice. On inspection I determined that the part of the document consisting of the first bullet point under the heading 'Project Rose' is privileged. However, privilege has not been established over the third bullet point. If privilege is attracted over that part of the document, it has been waived. Document 1297 is a redacted copy of an email from Cooper to Lindberg and Scales, copied to Quennell, dated 16 November 2004. It appears that the redactions mask those parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made. Prima facie, the document appears to be within the scope of the waiver I have identified and applied in these reasons for judgment. However, I propose to invite further submissions from the parties as to whether document 1297 is in contest and, if so, I will direct that an unredacted version of the document be filed with the Court for its inspection. As for the remaining documents, AWB has in some instances claimed privilege over the entire document and in other instances it has only claimed privilege over a designated part or parts of the document. AWB has established that legal professional privilege attaches to the following documents to the extent claimed by it: 20, 21, 55, 89-98, 107, 108, 119, 133, 135, 143-146, 150-152, 154-160, 162-190, 194, 196, 197, 199-201, 204-211A, 215, 217-222, 224-228, 230-234, 237-239, 254-256, 260-262, 264, 269, 270, 273-278, 281, 282, 285, 286, 288, 293, 302-306, 311, 315-324, 334, 343, 345-347, 349-353, 354, 358, 362, 368, 374, 381, 382, 384, 387, 388-393, 395, 398-408, 410, 412-414, 416-421, 423A, 426-428, 430, 431, 433-442, 444, 450-454, 456, 457, 459, 460, 462, 464, 465A, 467, 468, 470-473, 475-485, 488, 490-494, 496-502, 504-506, 509, 510, 514, 515, 517-519, 521, 525, 529, 530, 536-540, 549-552, 556, 558-562, 564, 566, 567, 581, 591, 593, 600, 605, 671, 672, 673A, 679, 694, 696A, 704E 704I, 704Q, 704R, 704U-704W, 704Y, 704Z, 704BB-704EE, 704GG, 704HH, 704JJ, 706-710, 724, 727, 740-745, 747, 748, 751, 752, 754, 758-761, 763-766, 768-770, 772, 773, 775, 777, 779-781, 785, 787, 790, 792, 797, 799-802A, 804, 806-814, 816, 818, 819, 821, 822, 826-831, 835, 849-852, 856, 857, 860, 861, 863, 865, 866, 868-870, 873, 876, 877, 879, 881-883, 885, 887-889, 890AB, 890AC, 890AG, 890AIA, 890AL, 890AR-AZ, 890BA-890BG, 937AJ, 937AP, 942, 947, 948, 950-953, 956-964, 966, 970-992, 994, 995, 997, 998, 1000-1004, 1071, 1073-1081, 1082A, 1083, 1086, 1087, 1112-1113A, 1114-1117, 1118A, 1152A, 1155, 1158-1160, 1190, 1195, 1196, 1200, 1206, 1213-1215, 1218, 1225, 1226, 1229, 1231, 1232, 1234, 1237, 1239, 1240, 1243, 1246-1250, 1252, 1255, 1256, 1260, 1261, 1293 and 1299-1301. COPY DOCUMENTS AWB has filed a list of duplicate privileged documents. The list is Exhibit JM5 to the affidavit of John Mitchell sworn 28 July 2002. Each document in the list is a duplicate of an identified document in AWB's list of privileged documents. The duplicates fill 17 lever arch folders. AWB has sought a declaration that the documents in this list are, or record, confidential communications that are protected from production to the Commissioner by legal professional privilege. At the hearing, neither AWB nor the Commonwealth directed any substantive submissions to the status of these duplicate documents. In its written submissions, AWB referred to the principles enunciated in Propend as to the circumstances in which a copy of an unprivileged document can itself attract legal professional privilege. In those written submissions, AWB contended that the qualification which Brennan CJ expressed in Propend at 512 does not represent the law. The Chief Justice's qualification was that if the original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or it is not produced, and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is available to prove the contents of the original document, then privilege cannot be maintained over the copy. However, AWB did not make any submissions as to how, or why, this qualification might be relevant to its claims. AWB adopted the position that the status of the duplicate documents depends on my decision as to the status of the corresponding original document. The Commonwealth did not make any submission to the contrary at the hearing, although its written submissions contended that AWB had failed to identify the purpose for which particular duplicates were created, or to establish that they were kept confidential. It would seem a harsh result if AWB were to lose the benefit of privilege in original documents simply because it has not explained or is unable to explain the circumstances in which copies were made. In large organisations and within law firms, it is hardly unexpected that multiple copies of privileged documents will be brought into existence and that, long after the event, it may be difficult to adduce evidence as to the circumstances in which the copies were made. The submissions of the parties were so cursory that I did not gain any meaningful assistance from them. However, I have reached the following conclusions. Where I have held that specified original documents do not attract legal professional privilege, no case has been made out that duplicates of those documents are entitled to privilege. Where I have held that specified original documents attract legal professional privilege, I have concluded that privilege attaches to the duplicates. The duplicates come from the custody of AWB, and there is nothing to suggest that the duplicates were dealt with, or communicated, in ways that would deny the privilege claim. Furthermore, the material before me does not identify any specific grounds for concluding that the duplicates do not attract privilege. A number of documents in AWB's revised list of privileged documents are said to be duplicates of other documents in the list. There is no evidence as to some of those documents (documents 291, 307 and 580) and others have been removed (documents 26 and 1031). Consequently, I have not made any findings about those documents; it is unclear whether they remain in contest. It is necessary to make specific reference to a number of other duplicate documents in the list: (a) Document 582 is a copy of document 140. I have determined that AWB has waived any privilege attaching to the documents. (b) Document 998 is a copy of document 995 and document 1001 is a copy of part of document 1000. I have determined that the originals are privileged. For the reasons given at [247] above, privilege attaches to the copy documents. (c) Document 1006 is said by Chesterman to be a copy of document 1005. My inspection of the documents has revealed that this is not the case. There is therefore no evidence capable of supporting the claim for privilege in respect of document 1006. However, even if there were evidence that document 1006 attracted privilege, I am satisfied that AWB has waived the privilege. RELIEF I have determined that specified documents are not the subject of legal professional privilege and that other documents attract legal professional privilege. The Court has power to make declarations to this effect. I propose to give AWB and the Commonwealth an opportunity to make submissions as to the form of any declarations that should be made to give effect to these reasons for judgment. AWB's second further amended application also sought declarations relating to the construction and validity of the Amending Act. In addition, AWB sought a declaration that the exercise of powers by the Commissioner under s 6AA(2) of the RCA, while these proceedings are pending before this Court, would constitute a contempt of Court, and injunctions restraining the Commissioner from making a decision under s 6AA(2) of the RCA. No live issues arise concerning these claims for relief: see AWB Ltd v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 2) [2006] FCA 913. Neither AWB nor the Commonwealth put any submissions to me, whether orally or in writing, concerning these claims for relief. It is unnecessary to address them further. Accordingly, the only orders I propose to make at this stage are as follows: (1) Within 3 business days AWB and the Commonwealth file an agreed minute of orders that give effect to these reasons for judgment. If AWB and the Commonwealth are unable to agree upon appropriate orders, within 3 business days AWB and the Commonwealth shall each file and serve a minute of the orders that it contends are necessary and appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment. (2) The proceeding be adjourned to Monday 25 September 2006 at 10.15am for any argument as to the orders. I certify that the preceding two hundred and fifty-one (251) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.

cited,Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 557,"The principles governing the exercise of the Court's power to summarily dismiss a claim on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, the principles which govern pleadings in this Court and the relevant authorities are conveniently summarised by Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 415-421. It is not necessary to restate, at length, his Honour's exposition of the relevant rules and the statements of principle which emerge from the cases to which he refers. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that: &#8226; The power to dismiss a claim because it discloses no reasonable cause of action will not lightly be exercised: see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130; Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 at 602-603. &#8226; The purpose of pleadings is to define the issues with sufficient clarity such that respondents understand, and have the opportunity to meet, the case made against them: see Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664; Mitanis v Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd [1997] ATPR 41-591 at 44, 151ff. &#8226; A statement of claim must plead all the material facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action. If it does not it is liable to be struck out: Mitanis ; Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712-713. &#8226; It is not sufficient for the pleader to state conclusions drawn from unstated facts: see Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109 at 114-5. &#8226; There will be cases in which the power to strike out pleadings will not be exercised notwithstanding a failure to plead all material facts. Such restraint will be appropriate where the deficiency causes no confusion and does not raise issues of substantive principle ( HECEC Australia Pty Ltd v Hydro-Electric Corp [1999] FCA 822 at [59] ), and where deficiencies can be overcome by ordering the provision of particulars or the furnishing of affidavits ( State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-691 at 42,828-9). &#8226; Not all conclusionary pleadings will be struck out as being deficient: see Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association (WA) (1987) 13 FCR 413 at 417. Whether or not such a pleading should be struck out will depend on whether or not the facts are pleaded at too great a level of generality: see Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 557. 32 Section 33H of the FCA Act requires that any application commencing a representative proceeding must identify the group members to whom the proceeding relates, specify the nature of the claims made on behalf of the group and specify the questions of law or fact common to the claims of the group members. By s 33C of the Act it is required that seven or more persons have claims against the same respondent, that the claims arise out of the same or similar or related circumstances and that the claims of all group members give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact. 33 As defined, the group in the present proceeding includes persons who have dealt directly with one or more of the respondents in relation to the provision of international airfreight services. It also includes persons who have had no such direct dealing but who have ""paid"" more than $20,000 for such services during the relevant period. The pleadings in paragraphs 85 and 86 suggest that, within the defined group, there are two further sub-groups: those members who have both paid for and acquired international airfreight services and those who have merely paid for those services. As will be seen these are not mere semantic objections. They give rise to the potential for confusion and, in turn, to embarrassment and prejudice. 34 Before turning to the substantial difficulties to which the imprecision of the definition of the group gives rise, it is to be observed that there are insufficient material facts pleaded to establish that the applicant is a member of the defined group which it seeks to represent. No attempt is made to establish (other than by conclusionary statement in paragraph 85) that the applicant acquired or paid for any international airfreight services in Australia (or anywhere else) during the relevant period. When read together, ss 33C and 33H of the FCA Act require that an applicant in a representative proceeding must be a person who shares with group members the same identifying criteria. 45 The fuel surcharge is dealt with in paragraphs 29 to 55 of the SASC. In paragraph 54 it is pleaded that ""[t]he Respondents and each of them engaged in the conduct alleged in paragraph (sic) 31-51 ..."" In paragraph 55 it is alleged that, by doing so, the respondents and each of them gave effect to the global cartel arrangement or the subsidiary fuel surcharge arrangement. In paragraph 87(b) it is alleged that all respondents are jointly and severally liable for all loss and damage caused by the imposition of the fuel surcharge. 46 When, however, one examines paragraphs 31 to 51 one finds that paragraphs 31 to 36 deal exclusively with the conduct of Lufthansa; paragraphs 41-45 deal exclusively with the conduct of British Airways, and paragraphs 46-50 deal exclusively with the conduct of Japan Airlines. In paragraph 37 it is alleged that all respondents, other than Lufthansa, introduced fuel surcharges ""at agreed levels"" in February 2000. No particulars of this agreement are provided, nor are the ""agreed levels"" identified. 47 The war-risk surcharge is dealt with in paragraphs 64 to 70 of the SASC. The parties to the arrangement pursuant to which the war-risk surcharge was imposed are identified in each of these paragraphs as being Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and British Airways. It is not pleaded that Qantas, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand or Japan Airlines were party to the arrangement or gave effect to it. 48 Despite this paragraph 87(d) pleads that all respondents are jointly and severally liable for all loss and damage caused by the imposition of the war-risk surcharge arrangement. 49 The applicant seeks to meet the respondents' objections to these parts of the SASC by contending that all respondents are liable for any damages occasioned by the imposition of any surcharge because they were all parties to the ""overarching"" global cartel arrangement. That overarching arrangement is said, in paragraph 26, to be an agreement to meet and discuss the fixing of prices for the carriage of international airfreight and to conceal any resulting price-fixing arrangements. The surcharges are said to have been agreed upon in the course of meetings and discussions held under the overarching arrangement. This arrangement contemplated that any agreed fixing of prices would emerge from further discussions among the respondents or some of them. In the case of the war-risk surcharge not all respondents are alleged to have agreed to impose the surcharge or to have given effect to such an agreement. Their participation in the making of the global cartel arrangement, without more, cannot render those respondents which were not involved in the making and implementing of the war-risk surcharge agreement jointly and severally liable for damages arising from the imposition of that surcharge. 50 These parts of the SASC are internally inconsistent, confusing and embarrassing."
cited,Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709,"In light of the above cases, and putting to one side the effect if any of the communications between Mr Myer and Mr Patching, there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty especially given the information acquired about the applicants in the ongoing AFP investigation. Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm: cf Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709 esp in its reliance on State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500 at 517. And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP. Given the police's function in the matter, the applicants would not have been objects of rescue (as they would have been if there was a duty to warn)."
cited,Buckley v Bennell Design &amp; Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301,"Those cases reflect the policy underlying s 1335 that security may be ordered where a company appears to be in no position to provide security from its own resources where, in all the circumstances, it is reasonable that the resources of some other person or entity standing behind the company or of some person or entity for whose practical benefit the proceeding is being conducted should provide the security. The privilege of limited liability should not necessarily exclude those standing to benefit from proceedings by that company from having to provide support to it: Buckley v Bennell Design &amp; Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 303-304. The approach was conveniently expressed in Bell Wholesale 2 FCR 1 at 4 where the Full Court (Sheppard, Morling and Neaves JJ) said: ""In our opinion a court is not justified in declining to order security on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation unless a company in the position of the applicant here establishes that those who stand behind it and who will benefit from the litigation if it is successful (whether they be shareholders or creditors or, as in this case, beneficiaries under a trust) are also without means."""

This further issue was raised by Mr Rhodes by way of challenge to the exercise by AFMA of its power of cancellation of Mr Rhodes' fishing permit for reasons of so-called 'non-payment of fees or levies'; it was acknowledged that '[i]n determining the scope of the obligation of natural justice, the statutory framework is of crucial importance'. I was referred by Mr Rhodes to the High Court decision of Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1963] HCA 41 ; (1963) 113 CLR 475, where in the reasons for judgment of Kitto J at 502-4, his Honour considered whether the Taxation Board of Review was '... legally bound to conform to the principles of natural justice in dealing with a reference in a case under s 136' . Kitto J made the prefatory observations that '[a] legal obligation so to act arises in respect of many statutory powers...', there being '... no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of tribunal...', but '[w]hat the law requires in the discharge of a quasi-judicial function is judicial fairness' , which is '... not a label for any fixed body of rules...,' and '[w]hat is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances' . The statutory context of the then Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1958 (Cth), which was of course in focus in Mobil Oil , is significantly removed from that of the Management Act. Mr Rhodes sought support additionally for the operation in principle of the rules as to natural justice from the dictum of Brennan J in National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd [1984] HCA 29 ; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 326, where his Honour observed as follows: the limits of a statutory function are ascertained the interests which are apt to be affected by the performance of the function can be identified. Then it is possible for a court to say in the absence of express statutory provision what has to be done to be fair to those whose interests are apt to be affected by the performance of the function. The terms of the statute which creates the function, the nature of the function and the administrative framework in which the statute requires the function to be performed are material factors in determining what must be done to satisfy the requirements of natural justice....' Those considerations render formidable the task of establishing the operation of the rules of natural justice in the present statutory context where the basis for prospective qualification would be the same for all applicants, that being the holding of an existing shark permit conditional of course upon payment of the permit fee or levy."

The first respondent submitted that an implied term of good faith was neither reasonable nor necessary in this case. It submitted that the mechanism established by the lease, allowing the lessor to nominate the rental assessment and the lessee to object, contemplates that the rent specified in the lessor's rental assessment may not be reasonable, or otherwise acceptable to the lessee. The first respondent submitted that the presence of the objection mechanism demonstrates that no such implied term is necessary. 94 The first respondent contended that the implication of such a term would alter the effect of the rent review mechanism agreed to, as it would enable a lessee to ignore a notice and ""embark upon a curial challenge"". 95 Even if such a term were to be implied, the first respondent submitted that the content of that term would require nothing more of the first respondent than that the rental assessment contained in the notice be an honestly held opinion. The first respondent submitted that the evidence supports the contention that the assessment contained in the notice represented the honest opinion of Mr Allen."
cited,Moodemere Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Waters [1998] VR 215,"The general entitlement of a receiver appointed under a charge to deduct and retain, out of the funds realised, costs, charges and expense incurred in the realisation was asserted as a matter of general principle in Moodemere Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Waters [1998] VR 215 at 222 (Murphy J) and 229 (Tadgell J). In Nicobar Pty Ltd v Abrokiss (2003) 48 ACSR 259, Young CJ said (at [60]): 'The general rule is that where a person who is a fiduciary or an officer of the court produces a fund through his own effort, he is entitled to an equitable lien over the fund in respect of defending himself against claims made against him for what he did in producing the fund.' His Honour, however, was not prepared to accept that an equitable lien might exist in the case of a privately appointed receiver, saying (at [62]): 'Although the scope of equitable liens is wide and the boundaries are flexible, and although a receiver appointed out of court owes fiduciary duties both to his appointor and perhaps also to the mortgagor, I do not consider that the principle applies to receivers appointed out of court. If this were not so, there would be little point in the authorities continuing to emphasise the fact that the receivers in the successful cases of lien were receivers appointed by the court.' His Honour referred to O'Donnell, Company Receivers &amp; Administrators at [12.109] (Update 40) and Harris &amp; Lewin Pty Ltd (in liq) v Harris &amp; Lewin Agents Pty Ltd (1975-76) CLC 40-216.

West Asia contended that the arrangements it had made with Four M should be treated as valid and effectual on their face. It said that by agreeing to meet its share of the expenses for operating the ship and executing finance and mortgage documents to support the borrowing to purchase her, Four M gave value for its one share in the ship. However, no financial accounts or other documents are in evidence to show that Four M had any assets or financial substance to support its participation in the acquisition and holding of the ship. Its 2009 annual return showed that it had a paid up capital of about 18 million rupees and debts of about 220 million rupees."
applied,St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147,"In St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 Hely J stated a series of propositions which his Honour considered had emerged from the authorities in relation to the proper application of Order 15A rule 6 at [26] as follows: '(a) the rule is to be beneficially construed, given the fullest scope that its language will reasonably allow, with the proper brake on any excesses lying in the discretion of the court, exercised in the particular circumstances of each case: Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Ltd (1990) 99 ALR 728 at 733; 20 IPR 79 at 85; Minister for Health and Aged Care v Harrington Associates Ltd [1999] FCA 549 ; BC9902167 at [27]; (b) each of the elements prescribed in subparas (a), (b) and (c) of the rule must be established: Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1 at 11 [38] ; 167 ALR 385 at 367; [1999] FCA 1584 ; 47 IPR 21 at 30.

followed,SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 974,"Lacking in substance is an attempt to draw a distinction founded upon a factual contention that in the circumstances of the present case a Departmental officer intervened to "" prohibit the possible exercise of the power by the Minister "". In SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 974 Moore J concluded that a like application for leave should be refused and reached that conclusion "" regardless of whether the request was forwarded to the Minister "". His Honour observed: [7] The Minister submitted that the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed with costs because there were no reasonable prospects of success. First, the Federal Magistrate was clearly correct in concluding that there was no jurisdiction to review the Minister's decision for the reasons accepted by the Federal Magistrate. This was so regardless of whether the request was referred to the Minister for her personal consideration, and regardless of whether the delegate's decision was affected by jurisdictional error, notwithstanding there was no evidence at all to support such an assertion. Secondly, as was clear from s 417(7) of the Act, the Minister had no duty to consider the power under s 417, and therefore relief could not have been granted in the Court below even if there had been jurisdiction to consider the application. An application for special leave to appeal from His Honour's decision has been dismissed: SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA Trans 759."

considered,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1357 ; (2005) 147 FCR 235,"There is now a considerable body of authority dealing with this provision although its proper application is not altogether free from difficulty. The first matter to emphasise about the exception in subs (3) is that it applies not to a document as such but to a representation or representations contained in a document. It is well accepted that the hearsay rule contained in s 69(2) is founded on the ""rationale of reliability"" of business records generally. The exception to that subsection is founded on a ""rationale of unreliability"" of representations made in the circumstances envisaged by subs (3): see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1357 ; (2005) 147 FCR 235 at [27] . As Barrett J put the matter in Vitali v Stachnik [2001] NSWSC 303 at [12] : The purpose of the exclusion is ... to prevent the introduction through this exception to the hearsay rule of hearsay material which is prepared in an atmosphere or context which may cause it to be self-serving in the sense of possibly being prepared to assist the proof of something known or at least apprehended to be relevant to the outcome of identifiable legal proceedings. 10 The focus of the contemplation referred to in subs (3)(a) is, as Lindgren J indicated in the Advanced Medical Institute case, upon the contemplation of the person who ""prepared"" or ""obtained"" the relevant representation. As his Honour said at [25]-[27]: 25. ... In order for s 69(3)(a) to apply, a person must have ""prepared"" or ""obtained"" the representation (not the document) in contemplation of a proceeding. It is an unusual use of language to refer to the ""preparing"" of a representation, but I think that the intention is clear enough; the reference is to the person who prepared, formulated, shaped or framed the terms in which the representation is made. This will typically, perhaps always, be or include the maker of the representation. 26. The person who ""obtains"" a representation is a person who seeks the representation or procures it to be made. This person is not the maker of the representation, but may be a person who ""prepared"" it. 27. By referring to persons who prepared or obtained the representation, the legislature was attempting to encompass all those who might cause a representation to be made in the form which it takes."
referred to,Kokatha People v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1057,"The onus of proof is on the Land Council, which must satisfy the legal burden on the balance of probabilities, but there is no reason to conclude that if the Land Council establishes a prima facie case of no native title, there is no onus on Worimi to adduce any evidence in support of his assertion of native title. In dealing with the defensive use of native title in Kokatha People v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1057 , Finn J observed at [52] that a non-applicant native title claimant who is unable to obtain authorisation to make a s 61 claim stands in no different position than any person who claims native title but is unable to institute proceedings to have that claim established. 52 If the elements of native title are established by a non-applicant claimant, it can prevent a determination that native title does not exist, although it cannot secure a positive determination of native title under s 225 of the Act ( Kokatha at [50] per Finn J). However, Worimi's evidence may be sufficient to raise a doubt as to the non-existence of native title without amounting to proof necessary for a claimant application or for a finding that native title exists. 88 In relation to the non-claimant application for a determination that no native title exists over the Land, the following seems to me to apply: &#8226; The Act permits the making of non-claimant applications for determinations that no native title exists over land. &#8226; This allows people with interests in land to ascertain whether native title exists. The Act envisages that determinations of the absence of native title may be made and provides a statutory guarantee of validity to future acts (s 24FA). Section 61(1) provides for non-claimant applications for native title determinations. There is no indication in the Act that there is a presumption that native title exists that must be displaced by an applicant seeking a determination of the absence of native title. &#8226; The Minister has not abandoned his right to participate in these proceedings. The Minister has an interest in these proceedings, namely, to ensure that if the Court is not satisfied that there is no native title over the Land, that the Court does not make findings in relation to matters which would need to be addressed in making a positive determination of native title. The Minister also has an interest in knowing whether or not, and in what way, the Crown's radical title is burdened by native title rights and interests. In any event, the Act does not require the Minister to establish an interest in order to be party to these proceedings. &#8226; These proceedings do not enable Worimi to obtain a declaration that native title exists. In order to establish that native title exists, it is necessary to make an application under the Act and to comply with the Act and the requirements for the establishment of native title ( Kokatha ; Clifton ; Worimi 2007 ). &#8226; An applicant for a determination of the absence of native title has an onus to establish that there is no native title over the land. That onus applies to a civil standard. The applicant must demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that native title does not exist. &#8226; There is no indication in the NSW Act or the Act to indicate that the standard to be applied is other than the ordinary civil standard. &#8226; A respondent to the application may adduce evidence to cast doubt on the applicant's case. As I said in Worimi 2007 at [35], Worimi would need to advance a case that establishes that native title does exist or to cast doubt on the Land Council's evidence. Worimi's assertion of his native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non-claimant application ( Worimi 2007 at [30]). &#8226; The decision is based upon the whole of the evidence before the Court including evidence adduced by Worimi. &#8226; The evidence adduced by Worimi should be assessed to determine whether it is sufficient to cast doubt on the Land Council's case such that the Land Council does not satisfy the Court that, on the balance of probabilities, no native title exists over the Land. &#8226; Accordingly, the onus is not on the Land Council to satisfy the Court as to the absence of each element required to prove the existence of native title. The Land Council is not required positively to establish the situation pre-sovereignty and from sovereignty to the present time with expert evidence of laws and customs. It is contrary to logic to say that a person who wishes to establish that there is no native title must first positively prove that there were laws and customs at any stage. &#8226; Worimi is the person who asserts the existence of native title. That necessarily means native title under the Act. The evidence must address the elements of such a claim, in particular the laws and customs and rights and interests from pre-sovereignty or the time of sovereignty to the present. It is not necessary to prove each element of native title but the evidence should be sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements it does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist. If the evidence establishes the absence of a necessary element of native title, such as continuous connection with the Land, this would provide support for a determination of the absence of native title. &#8226; The Land Council may call evidence as to the existence or non-existence of laws and customs at each of those stages and as to the existence of a class or persons claiming the communal, group or individual rights. The Land Council may establish that only one necessary element is missing, such as continuous connection. That would be sufficient to establish an absence of native title. &#8226; The subject matter of this application is the land constituted by a single lot, Lot 576. Worimi contends that it is impossible to deal with Lot 576 without also considering the surrounding land. The Land Council has no obligation to demonstrate an absence of native title throughout the Port Stephens area. The evidence needs to concern the Land. However, evidence that relates to an area that goes beyond a recently subdivided lot is likely to be relevant. The question remains, however, whether there are native title rights and interests over Lot 576. &#8226; It is not in dispute that all formal requirements for a non-claimant application for a determination of the absence of native title have been met. In the absence of any evidence as to the existence of native title over the Land, the Land Council would be entitled to the determination it seeks. Both the Land Council and Worimi have adduced evidence addressing the existence of native title. It is necessary to consider the whole of that evidence to ascertain whether the Land Council has established, on the balance of probabilities, that there is no native title or whether sufficient doubt has been cast on the Land Council's case."

The appellants seek to raise again the very same ground. I accept the first respondent's submission that there is no error shown in his Honour's conclusion that res judicata applied to preclude the appellants from pursuing a second judicial review application on this ground. Res judicata can operate as a bar to a judicial review application in these circumstances: see MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 ("" MZWHW "") at [11] referring to Re Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 722 ("" Wong "") at [71]. 18 The Federal Magistrate's decision was, so it seems to me, a final decision: see MZWHW at [6]; also SZEEO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 546 at [8] - [11] ; NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 at [29] ; and MZWZL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1475 at [11] . Accordingly, the appellant did not require leave to appeal."
referred to,"Vans, Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137","there is some level of uncertainty as to the burden of the ""no reasonable prospect"" formulae in s 31A: see e.g. Vans, Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; this is not a case in which it is necessary to explore that formula at any length. The claims made against the first and third respondents are doomed to failure as they disclose no reasonable causes of action in any event. The Amended Statement of Claim is itself embarrassing and must be struck out under O 11 r 16. As the applicant has been given every reasonable opportunity to replead and has been given adequate forewarning of what was needed and required, I will not give leave again to further amend the Amended Statement of Claim. Rather I will order the application be dismissed. I will consider the claims made against each respondent in turn."

applied,Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Baker (1997) 73 FCR 187 ,"the ability to take such matters into account as 'past and present general conduct' (or indeed as 'past and present criminal conduct' for the purposes of s 501(6)(c)(i)) is dependent on a finding that conduct of that description has occurred. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Baker (1997) 73 FCR 187 , a Full Court of this Court held that it was not necessary, for the purposes of taking such conduct into account, for it to have resulted in a conviction. However, the Full Court concluded at 194 that the forerunner of s 501(6)(c) was: '... concerned with a person's conduct either ""general conduct"" or conduct of a more particular kind, described as ""criminal conduct"". It is not concerned with whether the conduct has had some temporal result, such as the incurring of a conviction, but with the light that the conduct throws on the actor's character. Of course, in the absence of a prosecution and conviction, satisfaction that criminal conduct has occurred will not be attained on slight material: see the interesting note by B Robertson, ""Criminal Allegations in Civil Cases"" (1991) 107 LQR 194. ' In Baker the Full Court also held that the Tribunal may rely on both kinds of conduct (both criminal conduct and general conduct) in deciding whether a person fails the character test and need not anchor its decision in one of the matters mentioned in subparas (i) and (ii). A later amendment to the provisions has made this abundantly clear by the insertion of the words 'either or both of the following' in s 501(6)(c). Part 2 of Direction No 21 sets out the considerations to which decision-makers must have regard when, if the non-citizen does not pass the character test, exercising the discretion to decide whether or not the non-citizen should be permitted to enter or remain in Australia. Paragraph 2.2 provides: ' Weight of considerations 2.2 The Government is mindful of the need to balance a number of important factors in reaching a decision whether or not to refuse or cancel a visa. In making such a decision, a decision-maker should have regard to three primary considerations and a number of other considerations. The primary considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.3 2.16 and other considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.17 2.24. Decision-makers must have due regard to the importance placed by the Government on the three primary considerations, but should also adopt a balancing process which takes into account all relevant considerations.' Reference was made to what Deane J said in Pochi at 685: '[T]he Tribunal was bound, as a matter of law, to act on the basis that any conduct alleged against Mr. Pochi which was relied upon as a basis for sustaining the deportation order should be established, on the balance of probability, to its satisfaction by some rationally probative evidence and not merely raised before it as a matter of suspicion or speculation.' and to the Full Court in Baker , that 'satisfaction that criminal conduct has occurred will not be attained on slight material'. The Minister submitted that there is no basis to suggest that the Tribunal did not apply a standard of balance of probabilities. The real complaint, according to the Minister, appears to be that the Tribunal had regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports when finding that the applicant failed the character test in s 501(6)(c). As the Tribunal found that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(a) any error in also finding that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(c) is irrelevant. In any case, there was no reason why the Tribunal could not have regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As it noted, they indicated similar behaviour to that for which the applicant had been convicted: [156]. According to the Minister, there is no error in the Tribunal's statement at [168] [169] that a substantial number of similar reports from a wide variety of different sources detailing similar conduct increases the probability that the overall picture is true. This is perfectly rational reasoning in the circumstances of this case. The weight to be attributed to particular evidence was a matter for the Tribunal: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41 per Mason J. Given the nature of the applicant's convictions there was no reason why the Tribunal could not also have regard to other evidence of similar behaviour by the applicant when considering s 501(6)(c). In the circumstances of this case the Tribunal was not finding criminal conduct in the absence of a conviction on 'slight material' (as cautioned against in Baker at 194C), it was finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character tests in s 501(6)(a) and (c) 'on the basis of the evidence': [169], which included the applicant's criminal convictions as well as the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As 'criminal conduct' and 'general conduct' are not a dichotomy and may overlap, the Minister submitted that it was perfectly appropriate for the Tribunal to consider both together: Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 440 at [33] [35]. It might be otherwise if there were no convictions and there was a finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character test under s 501(6)(c)(i) and (ii) by recourse only to the police intelligence reports and the housing department records. In that context, the caution that came out of Baker referred to in [82] above, that there should not be a finding of criminal conduct on 'slight material', may well be apt. But that is not this case. The only real issue in the context of this case was whether the Tribunal acted capriciously in taking into account conduct referred to in the police intelligence reports and the housing department records of a kind similar to the conduct which constituted offences for which the applicant had been convicted; Ngaronoa (Jacobson J) at [60]. Clearly it did not and, unsurprisingly, there was no suggestion or submission that it did. This ground cannot sustain the application for review. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in finding that the applicant failed the character test under ss 501(6)(c)(i) and/or 501(6)(c)(ii) of the Act by taking into account the police intelligence reports and the housing department records concerning the applicant because in doing so it took into account irrelevant considerations. Those reports and records went into evidence; it was not articulated why the matters contained in them were irrelevant considerations to which the Tribunal could not have regard, particularly when they 'showed a continuing pattern of similar behaviour' (similar to the behaviour constituting the offences upon which the convictions were based) and 'paint a similar picture'. There is certainly no prohibition in the Act, express or implied, against taking such considerations into account. The weight to be attached to them is a different matter; it is a matter for the Tribunal, not for this Court on review of the Tribunal's decision. In my view, this ground has no merit and cannot sustain the application for review."

His Honour at 230 noted that the power to order such costs is not ""to be circumscribed in any way"" and, at 231, that the power ""is not so circumscribed that an order of this character may be made only against an ethically or morally delinquent party"". His Honour at 233 noted as one of the circumstances which have been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion ""an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise"". 25 In my opinion in the present case the refusal of the applicant's offer was imprudent. It was made when the parties' evidence, or at least the great bulk of it, was available in affidavit form. It would have been apparent to an objective observer that there was, at the lowest, a serious risk of a Court finding that there had been a gross misrepresentation as to the croppable areas of Broadmoor and Lower Wilmot and that this had led, along with other factors, to a gross over valuation, as demonstrated, apart from anything else, by the result of the subsequent sales. The objective observer would also have been aware that it would take a long and expensive trial for the applicant to run its case to judgment. 26 I will order that the Robinsons and Mantach pay the applicant's costs on a party and party basis up until 21 March 2007 (being 14 days from the date of the offer) and thereafter on an indemnity basis. 27 There is no opposition to an extension to 15 February 2008 of the time for filing and serving a notice of appeal.

referred to,"Lindon v Stanton (Supreme Court of Western Australia (Adams M), 27 November 1992, BC9200887)","The respondents further submitted that a consent order giving effect to a settlement could only be set aside on grounds that would justify setting aside the contractual agreement on which the settlement was based.

They contended that O 35 r 7(4) conferred power to make orders that were truly supplemental and did not confer power to vary or alter the initial order. 18 Ultimately, so the respondent said, the applicants made a decision not to pay before the end of January. This decision was based on the applicants' view that it was not in their interest to pay the money at that time. The respondents submitted that they should not be penalized for the applicants' error. The respondents noted that they would be prejudiced by any variation of the kind sought in the orders of 10 October 2006 because the vehicles were likely to be worth more than $33,000."
cited,In re Riddell ex parte Earl of Strathmore (1888) 20 QBD 512,"second issue is that it is very clear that the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice was finally decided by the Deputy District Registrar on 13 May 2005. In the context of r 31.04 Federal Magistrates Court Rules , the concept of finality is referable to whether the decision in relation to the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice finally determined the rights of the applicant or the respondent in favour of either of them. A similar test applies in a number of contexts, for example: &#8226; interpreting the meaning of 'final judgment or final order' in s 40(1)(g) Bankruptcy Act (see, for example, the test articulated by Lord Esher MR in In re Riddell ex parte Earl of Strathmore (1888) 20 QBD 512 at 516); and &#8226; distinguishing a 'final judgment' from an 'interlocutory judgment' (see, for example, Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 per Taylor J at 440 and Windeyer J at 443)."

He observed that it may often be administratively appropriate for a written and signed notice to be required by the Department, before being satisfied as to a due appointment. However, he could can find nothing in the terms or objects of s 494D which confined the Minister as to the manner in which he was to be satisfied that notice of an authorised recipient has been duly given. Nor could he find in s 494D any intention to exclude the normal presumption that Parliament intends to allow a person to act for the purposes of a statutory provision through an agent (cf.

For example, an individual who maintains two homes (say, one in Melbourne and one on the Gold Coast) and moves between them according to the seasons may be a resident of both places. 11 Pensions and other benefits under the Social Security Act are, of course, not available to everyone. A recipient of benefits paid for by Australian taxpayers is expected to have a connection with Australia. The necessary connection in the case of pensions and benefits payable under the Social Security Act , generally speaking, involves Australian residence. 12 A person who has reached pension age is qualified for an age pension if he or she satisfies any of the criteria specified in s 43(1) and (1A).

The existence of simultaneous proceedings with respect to the same controversy is a highly relevant consideration but it does not necessarily follow that there should be a stay of the Australian proceedings: Henry v Henry at 591-592; CSR v Cigna at 389ff . 96 The test to be applied is whether having regard to the controversy as a whole, the Australian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the Voth sense: CSR v Cigna at 401. The considerations include which forum can provide more effectively for complete resolution of the matters in controversy, which proceeding was commenced first and the stage that each of the proceedings has reached: Henry v Henry at 592. 123 The problems which arise if the same controversy is to be litigated in different countries which have jurisdiction with respect to the same matter are such that, prima facie , the continuation of one or other of them must be seen as vexatious or oppressive in the sense stated in Voth : see Henry v Henry at 591."

considered,Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358,"And finally, there are observations by Heerey J in Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 , which are apposite in the context of the affidavit material filed in the present application. Heerey J said of the case before him at [17]: ... Mr Meyers has filed a substantial amount of affidavit material sworn by himself and others. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the issue is not whether his version of events is more plausible than Andi-Co's, but whether the alleged debts are the subject of genuine disputes and whether the alleged offsetting claims are genuine, that is to say, real and authentic as opposed to false, illegitimate, phoney, counterfeit and false. Accordingly, I shall not engage in an assessment of the rival merits. 18 The plaintiff asserts two offsetting claims. The first of the offsetting claims relates to what is said to be a genuine claim of the plaintiff against the defendant for the infringement of three patents, arising out of the defendant's manufacture and sale of water meter assemblies. 19 The second offsetting claim relates to an order for costs made in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant by me on 9 August 2004 in action Q69 of 2003."

Further, there was no challenge by the respondents to the fact that the name ""Clark Rubber"" had become distinctive and was capable of appropriate protection. However, this case is not about the appropriation of a name but rather about the appropriation of get up, albeit in the context of a colour scheme. 17 The respondents submitted that the first respondent's premises was sufficiently dissimilar in its appearance to the Clark Rubber stores and it did not an amount to an attempt to pass itself off as a Clark Rubber store. Further, the respondents contended that there was no proprietorial stake in the colour yellow per se which they contended was the yardstick of the applicants' claim. The respondents also contended that the use of the ""Oasis Foam &amp; Rubber"" logo would be sufficient to enable customers not to be misled as to the identity or association of the first respondent's store."
referred to,Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 208 ALR 385,"Another matter relevant to insolvency is the prospect of funds likely to be available from a third party, such as from a capital injection or a subordinated loan. The Court will generally be sceptical of a mere assertion of a third party's willingness to provide such support. Such asserted willingness should be cogently demonstrated as a matter of commercial reality, even if the evidence falls short of establishing a legal obligation to advance funds: see the discussion in Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 208 ALR 385 per Palmer J at [112], [113]. That topic, too, was a matter upon which there was some difference between the parties, but for reasons which are discussed below, I do not think it is significant in this instance because there is so little evidence of any real prospect of any third party capital funding becoming available. In the end result, senior counsel for the creditor did not place much weight on the prospect of an externally sourced capital injection of funds to show whether Damilock was insolvent prior to about 12 February 2007. 22 As I indicated, Mr Lewis' conclusion was that Damilock was insolvent from at least early December 2006 and certainly by 26 December 2006 and remained insolvent until 26 June 2007. He expressed that view because, in the whole of that period, Damilock had a deficiency in its cash flow needed to pay its debts which had become due and payable, based upon hypothetical bank balance assessments which he had prepared. He recognised that conclusion was based upon an assumption that Damilock's creditors were paid on 30 day terms. On that basis, he concluded that Damilock would have required an increase in its overdraft facility in excess of $6m, increasing perhaps to $8m plus by 26 June 2007, to meet its debts as and when they fell due during that period. He did alternative calculations based upon creditor payment terms of 60 and 90 days. They did not alter his conclusion, albeit that the increased overdraft facility required would have been considerably less. He also concluded on his balance sheet analysis that Damilock had a material deficiency in its working capital of $528,000 as at 31 December 2006 increasing to $4,896,000 at 30 June 2007, and that those figures were conservative as they did not take account of non-current employee entitlements such as long service leave, and depreciation. 23 Mr Keith's view was that Damilock was not insolvent prior to 12 February 2007, and became insolvent some time between that date and 14 March 2007. He identified the reasons for his conclusion, differing from that of Mr Lewis, as being: 1. Damilock was in ongoing discussions with potential equity investors at least in the period up to 12 February 2007; 2. Damilock had achieved a large net profit of $530,000 in January 2007, so as to have given Damilock's directors reason to expect that, at that time, its profitability and cash flow was improving significantly; 3. Damilock had engaged Korda Mentha, ""highly regarded reconstruction and insolvency experts""; and 4. a report prepared by Korda Mentha as at 13 February 2007 did not state or express the opinion that Damilock was then insolvent, but indicated that Korda Mentha were in discussions with Damilock's directors so that Damilock was pursuing strategies to preserve the integrity of the continuing business."
discussed,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61,"Since writing these reasons for judgment, I have become aware of the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61. That judgment deals with an appeal by the Minister from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, which quashed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse a Business Skills Migrant visa to the respondent to the appeal, a person who had applied from outside Australia for that visa. The issue was whether the respondent had been denied what the Full Court called 'common law procedural fairness', because the decision-maker did not draw to the respondent's attention the point on which the decision against him turned. If the respondent were entitled to succeed on that issue, there was then an issue as to whether a right to procedural fairness was excluded by s 51A of the Migration Act , a provision in terms similar to both s 357A and s 422B , but relating to decisions by the Minister or delegates of the Minister. At [46] [59], the Full Court held that there had been no denial of procedural fairness, because the relevant point was obvious to the respondent. The Full Court then proceeded, at [60] [70], to make some observations, which are clearly obiter, on the effect of s 51A. Following VXDC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 (2005) 146 FCR 562, the Full Court expressed the view that s 51A operates to exclude the 'common law natural justice hearing rule' altogether. 97 To the extent to which Lay Lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357A of the Migration Act , it does not bind me to hold that Ms Antipova's only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act . In my view, to the extent that it suggests that s 422B excludes all principles of procedural fairness, other than those found in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act , VXDC is fundamentally wrong. The obiter remarks in Lay Lat are entitled to great respect, appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a Full Court, but I cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct. For the reasons I gave in Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170 at [28] , I remain of the view that the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with', appearing in each of ss 51A , 357A and 422B of the Migration Act are intended to qualify the words preceding them, and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words. If this were not the case, the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with' would be otiose, and it is not to be supposed that Parliament intended to enact meaningless, surplus words in a crucial amendment. The words are not the 'plain words of necessary intendment' required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness. See Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, and the authorities there cited. It is highly unlikely that Parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness, a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case, could arise. The present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in Lay Lat were to be followed. Assuming that s 360(1) of the Migration Act does not have the meaning that it has in my view, the Tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose, interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly, and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case, and the applicant would have no redress. It is impossible to imagine that Parliament intended such a drastic result. 98 To the extent to which the views expressed in VXDC and Lay Lat are said to be based on a reading of the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech relating to the bill by which ss 51A , 357A and 422B were introduced into the Migration Act , I repeat the view I expressed in Moradian at [35]. Those documents do not contain statements specific enough to resolve any ambiguity in those provisions, or to disclose a purpose specific enough to warrant a construction of the provisions that would regard them as excluding the entirety of the principle of procedural fairness described as the 'natural justice hearing rule'. 99 For these reasons, if it is necessary to ask the question whether Ms Antipova is entitled to succeed on the basis that the Tribunal denied her procedural fairness, by the manner in which it conducted her hearing, I do not regard VXDC and Lay Lat as requiring me to take a view different from that I have expressed above."
cited,"Re Spedley Securities Ltd (In liq) (1992) 10 ACLC 1,742","In the light of the Harmer Report and Young J's observations, Austin J characterised the court's approval under s 477(2B) thus (at 1,650): ... the court's approval is not an endorsement of the proposed agreement but is merely a permission for the liquidator to exercise his or her own commercial judgment in the matter. His Honour also approved the application to the exercise of the discretion under s 477(2B) of principles adopted by Mandie J in Re Aslor Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 1,412. That case concerned an agreement of more than three months duration involving compromise of a claim against the company. Mandie J followed principles applicable to the approval of compromises enunciated by Giles J in Re Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) (1992) 10 ACLC 1,742. On those principles the Court does not rubber stamp the liquidator's proposal. Nevertheless it will not generally interfere unless there is some want of good faith, error of law or principle, or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator's proposal. While the principles so adopted by Mandie J and approved by Austin J related to approval of compromises, they seem to me to have wider application to the exercise of the discretion generally under s 477(2B)."

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR 41-851 at 44,543, the Full Court raised the issue of the dispute in relation to the role of punishment in imposing penalties. The Full Court noted: ""...we see little or indeed no difference between taking into account, in computing the penalty, the deliberate nature of the conduct in question (a matter the relevance of which is not in dispute) and taking into account the fact that the penalty should act as a punishment of the offender."""
cited,A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 227,"I accept that Tribunals, and particularly lay Tribunals, sometimes assert that there is 'no evidence' on an issue when they mean that, although there is some evidence on the issue, they do not regard the evidence as sufficient to support a particular finding (see, for example A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 227 at [23] - [27] and Wickramasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 30 at [18] ). In every case the meaning intended to be conveyed by the Tribunal is to be determined by reference to the language used by the Tribunal understood in the context provided by the Tribunal's reasons for decision as a whole. In this case, having twice asserted that there was 'no evidence' of a particular character, the Tribunal went on to state that the appellant had not provided 'any information which would support [his] claim other than his own speculative assertion' . I conclude that the Tribunal's language, understood in the context provided by its written reasons as a whole, suggests that the Tribunal intended to convey that there was no evidence at all on the two matters identified by it."

referred to,Dias Aluminium Products Pty Ltd v Ullrich Aluminium Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1400,"Such matters are generally not capable of precise arithmetical calculation or analysis and are to a considerable extent matters of impression and judgment. See by analogy Dias Aluminium Products Pty Ltd v Ullrich Aluminium Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1400 at [7] . 20 I also consider that this conduct led to wasted costs in relation to much of the evidence of the respondents' expert Mr John Permewan. I did not afford his evidence any weight, because as I found, he was significantly misdirected by Metricon on a number of significant matters and was not told in the witness box before giving evidence about significant revisions to Metricon's witness statements. As a result, his opinions as to independent derivation were founded upon significantly incorrect assumptions and were of no real assistance to the Court. One example of this was that he incorrectly assumed that the Tyrell, Connolly and Streeton designs and homes were not designed by reference to the Prada 35. In fact, as I found, they were. He did not deal expressly in his report with the actual design drawings from which, according to the respondents, Prototypes 20A and 20B were derived. He assumed that certain evidence given by Bugeja, but which was disavowed by him at trial, was correct and he relied upon it. He accepted that Gallery 32 was used in the derivation of Prada 35. It was not. [252]-[256] Furthermore the applicants put the respondents on notice that Mr Permewan had been misinstructed. The solicitors for the applicants wrote to the respondents' solicitors by letter dated 9 October 2006 stating amongst other things that: Mr Permewan has proffered views about whether or not copying occurred by reference to his beliefs based on the untested evidence of Metricon's witnesses. It is clear from his report that Mr Permewan has taken as truthful, and without qualification, the evidence of Metricon's lay witnesses. I accept that consideration of Mr Permewan's affidavit evidence would have required significant amount of time before analysis on the part of the applicants' solicitors and counsel and indeed also by Dr John Cooke the expert architect obtained by the applicants. The matters deposed to by these lay witnesses may be overridden by the impressions formed by the Court following cross-examination. 21 The respondents should be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis to the extent of 50% of the preparation for trial and for the trial itself. The order should cover the period from early April 2006 when the respondents filed the first of the affidavits of Bugeja, Popple, Palazzesi and Biasin."
cited,Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela (1990) 19 IPR 435,"the Court has not had the benefit of submissions from the respondents on these points. However, the visual similarity in the tees is clear. Gummow J in Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela (1990) 19 IPR 435 at 15 said 'the design applies to the appearance of the article as a whole and issues of infringement are to be approached with that in mind'. Prima facie , there is a case that the tees sold by the first respondent infringe the Registered Design of the applicants under the Designs Act 1906 (Cth). Further, there is affidavit evidence from the applicants that at least some infringing kicking tees are being sold in stores operated by the first respondents. Finally, there is evidence before the Court, including correspondence from the respondents, which supports the third contention of the applicants in relation to the conduct of the respondents. In my view, these issues indicate that there is a serious question to be tried. 2. Damages insufficient In their written submissions and in oral submissions this morning the applicants submitted that whilst an account of profits or damages in respect of the infringements to date are sought in the eventual trial, long term damage to the market for kicking tees to which their Registered Design has been legitimately applied is of most concern."
cited,"Pham v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCAFC 179","the outset of the hearing of the appeals on 12 October 2009, Ms Mead sought to file in her appeal a Notice of a Constitutional Matter pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Notwithstanding the terms in which that Notice was expressed, Ms Mead explained that it was not intended to raise any matter arising under the Constitution in this Court. Rather than this Court being under a possible "" duty ... not to proceed "", Ms Mead was anxious for this Court to hear and resolve her claims immediately. Such a position, it may be noted, was inconsistent with the application to have the appeals in effect adjourned. The Notice was, in any event, understood as being more directed to the alleged failure on the part of the Federal Magistrate to give proper weight to Ms Mead's inability to comply with the 21 day period prescribed in the bankruptcy notice due to her being in custody. In the absence of any matter arising under the Constitution being raised in this Court, the appeal proceeded to be heard on 12 October 2009.

cited,Olivaylle Pty Limited v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (No 3) [2008] FCA 572 ; (2008) 76 IPR 152,"Lorenz was not initially a witness whom Flottweg proposed to call. After the expiry of the time fixed by direction for the filing of evidence in chief and for that matter after Olivaylle had closed its case, Flottweg made application for leave to file an affidavit made by him upon which, as events transpired, he came to be cross-examined. For reasons which I gave in the course of the trial, I permitted Flottweg to adduce evidence from him: Olivaylle Pty Limited v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (No 3) [2008] FCA 572 ; (2008) 76 IPR 152. Mr Lorenz was at the time of his involvement with events of present relevance and remains by occupational title a sales engineer. From about 2003 he has had worldwide responsibility within Flottweg for that company's dealings in the field of edible oils, which includes olive oil production. He had the benefit of being trained for his current role by his predecessor, a Mr Langenbrink, whom he replaced on the latter's retirement and a Mr Ecker, the Group leader of Flottweg's Edible Fats Oil Division, who retired in 2006. Each of Messrs Ecker and Langenbrink had extensive experience in the provision and servicing of production line machinery for the olive oil industry internationally. Mr Lorenz also has what I regard as the benefit of having carried out technical repairs, servicing, start up testing and operator training in respect of Flottweg decanters, tricanters, belt presses and Veronesi separators (and the associated plant such as polymer stations and screw conveyors) over a period of some 15 years prior to assuming the role of sales engineer. He undertook this work on joining Flottweg after his completion of a trade apprenticeship with one of its competitors. His title ""sales engineer"" gives an accurate idea of his current role. He is not just an equipment salesman. He is able to and does bring to the task of equipment sales an ability to assess and advise upon the performance characteristics, limitations and other technical aspects of Flottweg's machinery and production lines into which such machinery will be integrated based on both formal trade qualifications and, especially, years of relevant, practical experience with the machinery."
referred to,WSGAL Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 510 ; (1992) 39 FCR 472,"relation to satisfying the court that an applicant has a prima facie case for the relief claimed by it, such a preliminary question should not call for a substantial inquiry. The kind of evidence adduced on a preliminary inquiry of this kind should be in proportion to the nature of such an interlocutory issue. The purpose of the inquiry is to determine by way of a mini rather than a mega trial whether the applicant has a prima facie case (per Beaumont J in WSGAL Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 510 ; (1992) 39 FCR 472 at 476). Whatever is required to satisfy the court that there is a prima facie case, that satisfaction should leave open the possibility that the respondent could move to strike out the statement of claim or invoke s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('Federal Court Act'), which makes provision for orders for, amongst other things, summary dismissal or provisions of the Rules which provide for the summary disposition of proceedings.

cited,Maguire v Makaronis [1997] HCA 23 ; (1997) 188 CLR 449,"And, Brennan CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Maguire v Makaronis [1997] HCA 23 ; (1997) 188 CLR 449 at 466 (footnote omitted) (which was approved by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 at [107] ): 'What is required for a fully informed consent is a question of fact in all the circumstances of each case and there is no precise formula which will determine in all cases if fully informed consent has been given.' 40 The sufficiency of disclosure by a fiduciary can depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the person to whom it is made, so that it can truly be said that his or her consent is fully informed. That is a question of fact in all cases ( Farah Constructions [2007] HCA 22 at [107] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ). Because I am of opinion that no fiduciary obligation arose, it is irrelevant for me to consider the question of sufficiency of disclosure in the context of whether the proposed amendment is fairly arguable (cf: Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (In Liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 at 198-199 [77] - [79] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ)."

That function is to resolve controversies that arise under laws of the Commonwealth or under the Constitution itself and to determine finally all matters in dispute between the parties. Hence, the jurisdiction of this court to deal finally with the whole of the matter between parties even though only a part of it, and perhaps only a small part of it, involves an issue which is a 'matter' within the meaning of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution : see Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511. 29 It was suggested by senior counsel for Nine Network yesterday that what appears on page 7 in the statement of claim was a confidential matter involving a private communication within the Nine Network companies and was only of prurient interest to those seeking to exercise their right to inspect under O 46 r 6. That was put as a substantive basis for the resistance to the right of access being afforded and a suggestion that the material was confidential within the terms of r 6(1). 30 The allegation the subject of that submission was that on or about 11 January 2006 Mr Llewellyn was directed by an agent of Nine Network to prepare a news story attacking Mr Kerry Stokes of Channel 7 in relation to a news story on Channel 7 which in turn had attacked Mr James Packer. Mr Llewellyn alleged that he refused to follow that direction. There was then another allegation that a week later he was directed by Mr Chisholm to terminate a Mr John Lyons' employment due to what was alleged to be poor performance. Mr Lyons was at that time employed in the position of an executive director of the Sunday program."
considered,"Phoenix Court Pty Ltd v Melbourne Central Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 at 54,432","Section 51A does not provide an independent cause of action separate from s 52 or other sections in Part V of the Act ( Phoenix Court Pty Ltd v Melbourne Central Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 at 54,432, cf Sykes v Reserve Bank of Australia (1998) 88 FCR 511 at 513-514). Rather, s 51A provides, in summary, that where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter and it does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading (s 51A(1)). Section 51A in that respect is a ""subset of section 52"": Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 , Sykes 88 FCR 511 at 514, Quinlivan v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 175 at [5] ). I shall consider s 51A in further detail later in this judgment in the context of the future representations alleged by the applicants. 277 It has been suggested that, because the deeming within the meaning of s 51A(2) takes effect unless the corporation adduces some evidence to the contrary, this does not mean that the onus of proof (which otherwise lies with the applicant) is reversed, but merely requires the corporation to go into evidence ( ACCC v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd [2002] FCA 1276 at [46] ). The weight of authority however is that the person making the representation can only avoid the deeming in s 51A(2) by establishing on the usual balance of probabilities that there were reasonable grounds for making the representation: Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1136 at [82] , Ting [1993] FCA 524 ; 118 ALR 543 at 552, Bowler v Hilda Pty Ltd (1998) 153 ALR 95 at 108 and 117, Sykes 88 FCR 511 at 513-514, Adelaide Petroleum NL &amp; Ors v Poseidon Limited &amp; Ors (1988) 10 ATPR 40-901 at 49,700, Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 (and cf other cases in support of this proposition listed at Miller , 29th ed para 1.51A.37). 279 The effect of s 51A was encapsulated neatly by Goldberg J in Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 where his Honour observed: Section 51A does not create an independent cause of action separate from section 52 and other sections in Pt V of the Act but rather casts the burden of proof on the respondent and if that burden is not discharged then a breach of s52 is established by the applicant proving the representation as to the future matter and the fact that it did not come to pass. 280 Clearly whether the representor had ""reasonable grounds"" to make the relevant representation will depend upon the facts of the case in question. I consider this issue later in the judgment. 281 A second general observation with respect to the future representations concerns the applicants' claim that each budgetary forecast as to a future matter ""would be"" as is recorded in the budget. This expression appears in the Further Amended Statement of Claim in para 13(a)-(c), para 16(a)-(d) and para 17(c) and (d) with respect to budgeted costs and returns; paras 13(a)-(d) and 16 (a)-(d) with respect to projected fruit crops; para 13(d) and 16(d) with respect to packout rates; and para 16(f) with respect to yield. 321 The reasons given for this approach were that: &#8226; in relation to validation of the yield data the DPI publication was published in 1994 and specifically concerned the Central Burnett region as distinct from the South Burnett region where the relevant properties were located; and &#8226; in relation to providing an opinion as to packout rates Mr Frick stated in his expert report that information had been gained directly from industry contacts because there was no published data available to work with. (Frick expert report p 3). 322 Mr Frick did not identify the persons whom he consulted to validate the yield data or ascertain the packout rate information, although he did say during cross-examination that he had contacted four separate people: &#8226; one of the persons he contacted had a property half way between Bundaberg and Tiaro; &#8226; one of the persons was a Central Burnett grower; &#8226; the other people he contacted were citrus agricultural consultants. 323 In his expert report he stated: This information is in my notes and is not tendered as reference information. (Frick expert report p 2) 412 Accordingly: &#8226; The evidence demonstrates that the relevant properties were not maintained as orchards for the 2005 calendar year (or indeed the balance of the 2004-2005 financial year), and accordingly were not conducted after 23 June 2005 in such a manner as to earn revenue or profit, incur costs or cause fruit to be picked. &#8226; The evidence demonstrates that, objectively, the events predicted by the respondents' future representations in the 2005 Sunstate Budget.xls (the subject of para 13) did not occur. In the words of Goldberg J in Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 , the events did not come to pass. Sections 51A and 52 are thus enlivened."
distinguished,Morton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited [1951] HCA 42 ; (1951) 83 CLR 402,"The respondents relied on Morton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited [1951] HCA 42 ; (1951) 83 CLR 402. In that case the High Court held (at 410) that reg 188 of the Excise Regulations 1925 (Cth) were ultra vires the Excise Act 1901 (Cth) and void because regulations cannot vary or depart from the positive provisions made by the Act or... go outside the field of operation which the Act marks out for itself. The regulation in question was invalid because it imposed ""a distinct and independent addition of liability to the liabilities which the legislature has provided"" (at 412). 18 In the present case the respondents eschewed any argument that reg 2.14 was ultra vires and therefore void. 19 The present case is not like Morton where the statute covered the field and left no room for regulations. On the contrary, the scheme of both Old Act and New Act is to leave to the regulations questions of who may enforce."
cited,St. George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147,"As to the settled principles to be applied in an application pursuant to O 15A, r 6, the principles are these: the rule is to be beneficially construed and afforded the fullest scope its language reasonably allows; the 'proper brake' upon any excesses in the application of the rule lies in the exercise of the court's discretion ; the test for determining 'reasonable cause to believe' is an objective one; 'reasonable cause to believe' strikes a relationship with whether the applicant has a right to obtain particular relief or whether the applicant may have a right to relief and thus hypothecates a remedial outcome in the proposed proceedings on the assumption the evidence makes out each integer in the applicant's cause of action; such a belief, on either footing, requires more than mere assertion, suspicion or conjecture; a mere possibility of a right to relief is insufficient; the evidence, that is, an assessment of all the evidence, must incline the mind towards acceptance of the existence of a matter or fact in controversy out of which a right to relief arises or may arise; it is no answer to an application under O 15A, r 6 to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a 'fishing expedition'; the rule contemplates that an applicant will forensically examine the field of documents the subject of the order expressly for the purpose of enabling a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding; although the rule contemplates such an examination of the respondent's documents the subject of the order, the invasive nature of the order is predicated upon an objectively established reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have a right to contended relief; although an applicant does not need to establish a prima facie case, an applicant must establish that there is a reasonable cause to believe that each element of the potential cause of action is made out; although the threshold test may be set at quite a low level, the evidence must establish facts crystallising all the elements of a cause of action grounding the possible grant of the contended relief (see: St. George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 per Hely J [25] [29]; Hooper &amp; Ors v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1 at pp 11 and 12 per Wilcox, Sackville and Katz JJ [35] [40]; Glencore International AG v Selwyn Mines Ltd (2006) 223 ALR 238 at pp 240 and 241 [8] [16] per Lindgren J; C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 at [12] per Gyles J)."

Put in simple terms, the following distributions occurred in the 2001 income year. CEPL as trustee of the CU Trust distributed the entire income of the trust to or for the benefit of a discretionary unit holder, DCE Holdings Pty Ltd (""Clark Holdings"") as trustee of the David Clark Family Trust (the ""Clark Family Trust""). Clark Holdings distributed the income so received to David Clark Enterprises Pty Ltd (""Clark Enterprises"") as trustee of the David Clark Enterprises Trust (the ""Enterprises Trust"") and Clark Enterprises distributed the income of the trust to David Clark and Helen Clark in equal shares as beneficiaries of that trust. By s 97 of the 1936 Act, the assessable income of David Clark and Helen Clark includes a 50% share of the net income of the Enterprises Trust and in the event that the taxpayers are not able to establish that the CU Trust estate suffered previously unapplied net capital losses extinguishing the net capital gain arising out of the disposal of the Gladstone properties in the 2001 income year, the net income of the Enterprises Trust will also include a significant part of the net capital gain (discounted by 50%) made by the CU Trust in the 2001 income year. Accordingly, the first question to be determined in these proceedings is whether the applicants have discharged the onus of establishing that in the 1988 income year, the trustee of the CU Trust acquired the Rothwells shares."

considered,R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13,"Given that QWI was an active contradictor, the Delegate properly took the stance of abiding the order of the court and not wishing to be heard save if need be in respect of costs: R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13 , at 17, 35-36. 12 For the reasons which follow, I have concluded that the various grounds upon which, by their amended application, the Applicants sought the judicial review of the agreement registration decision do not lead to the result that the decision should be set aside. Work done under the Traveston Dam Agreement is therefore a valid future act for the purposes of the Native Title Act . 13 The grounds of review which came to be advanced by the Applicants are set out below: 1. The First Respondent erred in law and/or improperly exercised the power conferred upon her in finding that the requirements of Section 24CG(3)(b) of the Native Title Act had been satisfied in circumstances where: (a) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably be satisfied that the Gubbi Gubbi People and the Kabi Kabi People were part of the same wider group; (b) The First Respondent failed to take into account the following relevant considerations in reaching the conclusion that the Gubbi Gubbi People and the Kabi Kabi People were part of the same wider group: (i) That membership of the Gubbi Gubbi People was based on matrilineal descent from the apical ancestors James Crowe and Maggie Palmer whereas membership of the Kabi Kabi People was based on cognatic descent from a number of apical ancestors in addition to James Crowe and Maggie Palmer; and (ii) That the Gubbi Gubbi People have a mandatory traditional decision making process in relation to matters affecting land involving the reaching of a consensus decision by the Elders of the respective family groups within the clan without recourse to a majority vote of the group as adopted by the Kabi Kabi People when purporting to authorise the ILUA. (c) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably be satisfied that the Gubbi Gubbi People did not adhere to a mandatory traditional decision making process as aforesaid; (d) The First Respondent failed to take into consideration the fact that the Gubbi Gubbi People both before and at the authorisation meeting disputed the decision making process adopted at the authorisation meeting and did not authorise the making of the ILUA; (e) The First Respondent concluded that there was no mandatory traditional decision making process applicable to the subject decision in reliance upon evidence that emanated from persons who where no traditional custodians of such information; (f) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably have concluded that the Gubbi Gubbi People withdrew from the agreement making process; (g) The evidence showed that the Gubbi Gubbi People were not afforded the opportunity to separately consider the terms of the ILUA in accordance with the their mandatory traditional decision making process, in circumstances where the persons said to hold native title where encompassed by three separately represented constituent groups; (h) By reason of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1(a) (g) hereof the Applicants are not bound by the Kabi Kabi Peoples authorisation decision and did not themselves authorise the meeting of the ILUA. 2. The First Respondent erred in law and/or improperly exercise the power conferred on her in: (a) Limiting her registration decision to the criteria set out in Section 24CL of the Native Title Act ; (b) Failing to consider or properly consider whether the ILUA was an area agreement that complied with the requirements of Sections 24CB and 24CE of the Native Title Act . (c) Failing to find that the Cultural Heritage Investigation Management Agreement (""the CHIMA"") component of the ILUA contravened the provisions of the ACHA and so by reason of Section 24CE of the Native Title Act , that the ILUA was invalid either in whole or in part and was thereby no an area agreement capable of being registered. (d) Failing to find that the CHIMA component of the ILUA in so far as it dealt with the regulation of Cultural Heritage matters over land where Native Title rights had been extinguished was no properly the subject matter of an area agreement pursuant to Section 24CB of the Native title Act and thereby the ILUA was not an area agreement capable of being registered. Particulars (a) The CHIMA regulates Aboriginal Cultural Heritage matters as defined in the ACHA over areas where Native Title rights have been extinguished; and (b) To the extent that the ILUA deal with areas where Native Title rights have been extinguished: (i) The Aboriginal Party under the ACHA ought to have been a party to the ILUA as required by Section 23(3)(a)(iii) of the ACHA; (ii) The Aboriginal ILUA Parties did not have standing under the Native Title Act to enter into ILUA which purported to regulate Aboriginal Cultural Heritage matters over such areas; and (iii) It is not competent for an ILUA to deal with Cultural Heritage maters properly regulated by existing State legislation over land where Native Title rights do not exist."

cited,O R Cormack Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1992) 92 ATC 4121,"French J drew attention to the statutory context and the general principles that the classification of goods attracting exemptions or beneficial rates of tax should be liberally construed unless the text or context requires a narrower construction, and that words or phrases should be construed according to their popular meaning unless the evidence establishes that they carry a special commercial or trade meaning in their context: at 457 and 464. His Honour also noted that generalisations about the construction of statutory classifications are to be undertaken with caution, and that subtle changes in language can significantly alter the meaning and operation of a particular provision. French J contrasted the construction given by the authorities to the expression 'ordinarily used for household purposes' with the construction given to the expression 'goods for use' in some specified activity or by some specified person or entity. The former expression has attracted an objective test for characterisation of the goods said to fall within it: see Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Newbound &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1952) 10 ATD 59; 26 ALJR 386 at 387 per Dixon CJ; Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Sherwood Overseas Pty Ltd (1985) 75 FLR 474 at 477; O R Cormack Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1992) 92 ATC 4121 at 4123; and Hygienic Lily at 399. In the light of these authorities, French J expressed the test as follows, at 460: 'The question whether goods are ""ordinarily used for household purposes"" does not depend critically upon the use to which they are in fact put but on an assessment of their ""essential character"". That assessment does not involve fine semantic distinctions but a judgment which pays regard to the commercial realities of their manufacture and sale.'"
referred to,Audio Products Group Pty Ltd v Mamone [2005] NSWSC 982,"The respondents' submission that Mr Donovan, as a member of a class of possible objects of appointment, has no proprietary interest in the trust assets is correct: In re Coleman; Henry v Strong (1888) 39 Ch D 443 ; In re Weir's Settlement Trusts; Macpherson v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] Ch 145. However, I do not think that is fatal to the applicants' application. I say that for the following reason. I think the test formulated by the High Court in Cardile ((ii) in the passage quoted above at [15]) and reflected in O 25A r 5(5) is wide enough to cover the present circumstances. Both refer to a process which ""is or may ultimately be available"" and the fact that the third party "" may be obliged to disgorge assets"" or contribute towards satisfying the judgment or prospective judgment. It is possible that Mr Donovan will receive an interest under the Stephen Donovan Family Trust which is recoverable by a trustee in bankruptcy in the event that the applicants obtain a judgment against Mr Donovan and he is placed into bankruptcy upon being unable to satisfy that judgment. I am mindful of the fact that considerable caution must be exercised in making freezing orders against third parties, but at the same time there needs to be some flexibility in the test, as the circumstances of this case plainly show. Other courts have considered that the use of the word ""may"" is significant: Westpac Banking Corporation v Hilliard [2001] VSC 187 ; Audio Products Group Pty Ltd v Mamone [2005] NSWSC 982 ; Robmatjus Pty Ltd v Violet Home Loans Australia Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 165."
considered,Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328,"The applicant justifies the raising of those issues for the first time on appeal on the basis of an asserted obligation of the Tribunal to inquire into and correctly consider questions of law arising on the matter before it, even in the face of concessions or admissions by the parties. It relies upon Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328 at [36] [39] for that proposition. 32 I do not consider that that decision supports its contention. That case relevantly concerned the question of whether the Tribunal had erred in failing to address the question under s 24(2)(c) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) of whether the employee claiming compensation had undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment which was compensable. That consideration was relevant to whether the injury had resulted in permanent impairment, so as to entitle the employee concerned to a lump sum compensation payment. The Full Court (Drummond, Kiefel and Dowsett JJ) at [39] said: The Tribunal is not, as a general rule, required to ignore the fact that one or both parties have made admissions or concessions, express or implied, that particular issues which the original decision-maker may have had to consider need not be the subject of inquiry and determination by the Tribunal. The Tribunal will, however, fall into error of law by failing to inquire of its own motion into, and make a finding on, an issue the subject of an admission or concession by a party that is material to its decision if there is reason to doubt that the admission or concession is factually justified. But in the absence of there being some reason to question the admission or concession, the Tribunal will generally be entitled not to inquire into the issue for itself, but to act on that admission or concession in making its decision. 33 In my judgment, the conduct of the matter before the Tribunal clearly indicates that, at least impliedly, the applicant did not seek to ventilate the issues arising under ss 10(7) or 63 of the Act, and restricted itself to the matters which the Tribunal identified. The Tribunal in those circumstances was quite entitled to proceed upon the basis that those matters were not contentious. It did not err in failing to address them. Consequently, the applicant is not now entitled to assert or cannot succeed in asserting that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to do so."

referred to,Barclays Bank v Tom [1922] 1 KB 221,"Before the various cross-respondents made their applications for leave to defend the applicants' claim against Landmark there was a good deal to be said in favour of the applicants' application. I acknowledge that even at that time there were reasons not to order separate trials. They were the matters often present in cases involving third party proceedings such as the desirability of having all parties bound by the decision between the plaintiff and the defendant so as to avoid the possibility of inconsistent findings, the additional cost and expense of two trials and the disadvantages to a defendant in two trials including possibly having to satisfy a judgment in favour of the plaintiff well before his claim against the third party is determined: Barclays Bank v Tom [1922] 1 KB 221; New World Oil and Developments Pty Limited v 163 Clarence Street Pty Limited [1995] FCA 138. However, in this case there were a number of weighty considerations on the other side. First, there was a large number of factual issues raised on the various cross-claims all of which at that point appeared to be of no relevance to the applicants' claim against Landmark. That was so because the proportionate liability provisions as properly construed appeared to be irrelevant because there was little to indicate at that time to suggest that any of the cross-respondents were directly liable to the applicants. Secondly, the applicants' claim against Landmark was a good deal more advanced in terms of being ready for trial than were any of the cross-claims. Thirdly, the applicants' difficult financial situation was relevant as was the fact that, if liability was established, that had been brought about by Landmark's conduct. 81 In addition, I refer to, without setting out, the observation of Scrutton LJ in Barclays Bank v Tom [1922] 1 KB 221 at 224."

applied,D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397,"The question whether leave to appeal should be granted falls to be determined according to the criteria set down by the Full Court in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397. First, whether the impugned decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration. Secondly, whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted, supposing that the impugned decision was wrong. 21 The applicant, by his submissions, contends that: ""9. ... The proposition that [the second respondent] and/or Mr Ariss could have been expected to contend for, if present before the [Federal Magistrates] Court, namely, that they or one of them was the true owner of the jewellery, was clearly articulated as was the basis upon which they might seek to rely to establish such a claim: (a) there was express disclosure that [the second respondent] and Mr Ariss were persons named as insureds in relation to the jewellery; (b) there was express disclosure that the bankrupt gave evidence that when she asked her husband (ie, Mr Ariss) for the jewellery, he said the jewellery was the property of [the second respondent] and that she could not have it; (c) there was express disclosure that when the husband had been examined pursuant to s81 of the Bankruptcy Act , he asserted that he had given certain items of the jewellery to one or both of this daughters, consistent with ownership of the jewellery by him or [the second respondent]; (d) there was express disclosure that the bankrupt expressed the opinion that some of the house contents, the subject of the same policy of insurance, might be owned by [the second respondent] although, like the jewellery, such items of contents were not disclosed as an asset in the balance sheet of [the second respondent]. 10. In order to determine whether or not there was 'material' non-disclosure, it is necessary to have regard to the evidence of the bankrupt as a whole. It is asserted that the fact she had earlier given evidence contrary to the proposition the jewellery was hers was not disclosed. What the transcript of the evidence given by the bankrupt on 22 December 2005 discloses is that she did on occasion give contrary evidence. That is, on occasion she gave evidence that she thought that the jewellery was either that of Mr Ariss or [the second respondent]. However, what is critical is that she was examined as to why she might hold to that view. She said in evidence that she held that view for two reasons, namely: (a) because those persons were named as insureds in relation to the jewellery; and (b) her husband had told her that the jewellery was the property of [the second respondent] or of himself. Both considerations which had led [the bankrupt] to on occasion state that the jewellery might be the property of [the second respondent] or of Mr Ariss were disclosed on the ex parte application, as was the fact there was evidence consistent with such potential claims. 11. The cases establish that, on an application made ex parte, there must be disclosure of material facts. The material facts which were required to be disclosed here were: (a) that [the second respondent] and Mr Ariss were persons who were named as persons having an insured interest in relation to the jewellery. This was disclosed in the King ... affidavit and the relevant insurance documents were exhibited; (b) that Mr Ariss, currently the sole director of [the second respondent], held the view that the jewellery in question was either his or [the second respondent's]. This was also disclosed. 12. The best evidence that Mr Ariss and/or [the second respondent] would claim to be the owners of the jewellery, and the basis of that claim, was before the Federal Magistrates Court. There was direct evidence, of which the Court was informed, that Mr Ariss asserted the jewellery was his or [the second respondent's] and, on that basis, refused to return it to his wife. In those circumstances, the fact there was additional evidence from the bankrupt that, on the basis of the insureds' interest and on the basis of what her husband told her, she believed that the jewellery may be his or [the second respondent's] jewellery, was not material. ... ... 17. The King ... affidavit disclosed that [the second respondent] or Mr Ariss would assert an entitlement to the jewellery. The ... Magistrate knew that was the case they would make and knew there was documentary evidence in support of that case, at least as to an arguable insurable interest, notwithstanding none of the jewellery appeared on the balance sheet of [the second respondent]."" 28 The Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration. I do not think it necessary to go on to consider whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted, supposing that the Magistrate's decision was wrong. The two limbs of the test in D&eacute;cor Corporation cannot be considered in isolation from one another: see D&eacute;cor Corporation at 398-399. The prospect that an appeal, if leave were granted, would be successful is so remote that it would be artificial to suppose that the decision below is wrong.

related,Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001,"The following issues do not appear to be in contention: 1.

On 4 August 2006 I made orders determining two notices of motion, one brought by each party, concerning further disclosure ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001). Each party had success on its motion. I reserved the costs of both notices of motion, and the applicants submit that no costs order should be made on either notice of motion.

In relation to the hearings of 6 and 9 November 2006: &#8226; On 6 November 2006 I made directions to facilitate the bringing of an application for security for costs by the respondents, and reserved the costs of that directions hearing. &#8226; On 9 November 2006 I dismissed the application for security for costs brought by the respondents, and ordered that costs be reserved: Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1498. &#8226; The applicants submitted that the security for costs application was a discrete application lost by the respondents and that they should have the costs of the directions hearing on 6 November and the costs of the application for security for costs having regard to the order of 9 November 2006. This submission is not contested by the respondents in their written submissions. I accept the submissions of the applicants and order that the costs of the applicants of the hearings of 6 November 2006 and 9 November 2006 be paid by the first and second respondents on a party to party basis. 4. In their written submissions the applicants also conceded that they were not in a position to resist an order that they pay the respondents' costs for the remaining interlocutory hearings, with the exception of costs associated with orders made on 18 July 2006 and 21 July 2006. I will deal with these costs later in the judgment."
followed,Toll (FCGT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165,"The deed poll is not, in itself, a contract between legal persons. But it is a commercial document intended to be the foundation of a contractual relationship embodied in the notes when issued. The ordinary principles of construction of contracts should be applied to the provisions of the deed poll, as well as to the transaction overall. These principles require the rights of the parties to be determined objectively, without reference to their subjective beliefs or understandings about what rights or liabilities would govern their relationship. What matters is what each party, by words and conduct, would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. In this context, the role of the Court is to ascertain the common intention of the parties in the commercial matrix in which they contracted. This process involves discerning, in context, what a reasonable person would understand from the language in which the parties expressed their agreement, having regard to the objective surrounding circumstances with the purpose and the object of a transaction: Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ. The commercial purpose of a contract is, in essence, the purpose attributable to a reasonable person in the position of the parties who is aware of what was known at the time to both of them about the genesis of the transaction, its background, context and the market in which they were operating."
cited,Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v Interbulk Ltd [1986] 1 AC 965,"It is unnecessary and irrelevant to distinguish, in the present context, between a court that admits persons to practise as solicitors or barristers or both, and has an inherent disciplinary jurisdiction over persons so admitted as its officers, on the one hand, and a statutory court such as this Court on the other hand. In De Sousa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1993) 41 FCR 544, a case that pre-dated O 62 r 9(1) of the FC Rules in its present form, French J held that s 43 alone empowered the court to make a costs order against a solicitor. His Honour said that the Court's power to do so was to be seen as part of a wider power under the section to make a costs order against non-parties generally, and referred to Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v Interbulk Ltd [1986] 1 AC 965 (' Aiden ') and Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 ( 'Knight' ). In those cases, orders were made against non-parties other than legal practitioners under the general provisions conferring power to order costs (in Aiden , s 51(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK); and in Knight , s 58 of the Supreme Court Act 1867 (Qld) and O 91 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland). A rule such as O 62 r 9(1) does not reduce the power to order costs conferred otherwise."
cited,Lovett on behalf of the Gunditjmara People v State of Victoria [2007] FCA 474,"Lovett on behalf of the Gunditjmara People v State of Victoria [2007] FCA 474 the issue was addressed thus: ... There is a question as to how far a State party is required to investigate in order to satisfy itself of a credible basis for an application. One reason for the often inordinate time taken to resolve some of these cases is the overly demanding nature of the investigation conducted by State parties. The scope of these investigations demanded by some States is reflected in the complex connection guidelines published by some States. The power conferred by the Act on the Court to approve agreements is given in order to avoid lengthy hearings before the Court. The Act does not intend to substitute a trial, in effect, conducted by State parties for a trial before the Court. Thus, something significantly less than the material necessary to justify a judicial determination is sufficient to satisfy a State party of a credible basis for an application. As a result of my recurring concern with the undue burden placed upon applicants in cases resulting in consent determinations, I wrote to the parties prior to the hearing raising this concern in relation to the volume of material provided by the applicants in the present case. The State responded with a helpful and constructive submission which explained first, that in the recent Central Desert application filed by the Birriliburu People, the report provided by the representative body was short and targeted, and was used as a model report at the connection workshop conducted by the State at the end of 2008, and second, that the detail of the report in this case was provided by the applicants as a matter of their choice. It is to be hoped that the State will give careful consideration in future matters under s 87 and s 87A to easing the present unnecessary burden either placed on or assumed by native title applicants. On the material before the Court it is clearly appropriate to make the orders and the determination sought by the parties. It is now necessary to consider the proposed determination that the Nyangumarta Warrarn Aboriginal Corporation (the Corporation) be the trustee of the native title. Section 56 of the Act relevantly provides: Trust determination (1) One of the determinations that the Federal Court must make is whether the native title is to be held in trust, and, if so, by whom. Steps in making determination (2) The Federal Court is to take the following steps in making the determination: (a) first, it must request a representative of the persons it proposes to include in the determination of native title as the native title holders (the common law holders ) to indicate whether the common law holders intend to have the native title held in trust by: (i) nominating, in writing given to the Federal Court within a specified period, a prescribed body corporate to be trustee of the native title; and (ii) including with the nomination the written consent of the body corporate; and (b) secondly, if the common law holders give the nomination within the period, the Federal Court must determine that the prescribed body corporate is to hold the rights and interests from time to time comprising the native title in trust for the common law holders; and (c) thirdly, if the common law holders do not give the nomination within the period, the Federal Court must determine that the rights and interests are to be held by the common law holders. Native title held in trust (3) On the making of a determination under paragraph (2)(b), the prescribed body corporate holds, in accordance with the regulations, the rights and interests from time to time comprising the native title in trust for the common law holders. One of Mr Matthews' affidavits proves that the Corporation was registered under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 (Cth) on 11 March 2009 and was thus a prescribed body corporate for the purposes of ss 56(2) and (3) (see reg 4(1) of the Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999 (Cth) (the Regulations). Section 56(3) of the Act requires that the Corporation holds the native title rights and interests in accordance with the Regulations. I am satisfied that this is so. The rule book of the Corporation was tendered in evidence and rule 5.2.2 satisfies the requirement of reg 4(2)(a), rule 3(c)(i) satisfies the requirement of reg 4(2)(b), and rules 3(c)(i) and (ii) satisfy the requirements of reg 6(1). The Nyangumarta People filed a written nomination of the Corporation on 22 May 2009 in accordance with s 56(2)(a)(i) of the Act. The Corporation consented to the nomination and filed a written consent dated 22 May 2009 in accordance with s 56(2)(a)(ii) of the Act."
cited,Re Schofield and Comcare (1995) 38 ALD 124,"The applicant acknowledges that there is no false and wilful misrepresentation to the effect that he did not suffer, and had not previously suffered from, a degenerative condition in his left knee. That is the disease specifically which the Tribunal found had been aggravated by the respondent's employment with the applicant. The respondent's evidence was that he had previously had trouble with his left knee in 2002 when he had been learning to drive a truck with a heavy clutch, but that the problem had resolved following physiotherapy. It was not contended by the applicant that that circumstance was sufficient to have obliged the respondent by reason of s 10(7) to have disclosed specifically the previously degenerative condition of his left knee because it is now shown that he was aware of it. It is not a circumstance where the respondent failed to disclose a symptom of a disease in the left knee in circumstances where it ought to have been disclosed, as distinct from the suffering of a particular and temporary injury: cf Re Schofield and Comcare (1995) 38 ALD 124. 70 The medical evidence indicated that the respondent had an underlying degenerative condition of both his knees, but does not firmly indicate that those degenerative conditions were related, or that the incapacity caused by aggravation of the degenerative condition in the left knee was related to the degenerative condition in the right knee. Reference need only be made to the report of Dr Bauze of 12 September 2005 and of the respondent's general practitioner, Dr Chambers, in his report of 19 October 2005 discussed in the Tribunal's reasons. 71 The applicant submitted that ""the relationship between degenerative conditions in knees is hardly controversial"". That may or may not be correct as a matter of general medical science, but it does not address the particular findings of fact, or the particular evidence in this case. As its contentions indicate, there was some medical evidence considering the relationship between the degenerative conditions of the respondent's right knee and his left knee. The issue was not fully explored because, in the particular circumstances, it was not a matter upon which the Tribunal was required to make, or made, a finding favourable to the contention of the applicant. It merely found that the respondent had a degenerative condition of his left knee which had been aggravated by his employment with the applicant, leading to incapacity for work. That state of the evidence does not enable me to make any finding on the issue, as potentially authorised by s 44(7) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). 72 In those circumstances, in my judgment, the applicant has not shown in any event that the respondent made a wilful and false representation that he did not suffer, or had not previously suffered, from a degenerative condition in his left knee or had not suffered and did not suffer from the aggravation of that condition when he applied for his CMF or subsequently. In this particular case, the Tribunal did not make the finding upon which the applicant's contention is premised and in fact did not find that the degenerative conditions in the applicant's right and left knees were a single ailment, and should therefore be treated as a single disease. It made a different finding. The finding was open to it. 73 Consequently, the condition upon which s 10(7) would operate as a matter of fact to disentitle the applicant from compensation under the Seafarers Act has not been shown by the applicant to have been made out, and indeed its premise is inconsistent with the finding which the Tribunal in fact made."
referred to,Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389,"Honour observed at [24] that it was common ground that the phrase 'juices of fruits' does not have a trade meaning. At [36] he referred to what was said by a Full Court of this Court in Zeroz Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 35 ATR 349 at 357, 'if there is no trade usage then a fortiori the expression must be used in its ordinary English sense'. But P &amp; N in that case, like the applicant in this case, made a number of submissions which, at the risk of doing the applicant a disservice, went something like this: (1) While the phrase 'juices of fruits' does not have a trade meaning, the phrase is synonymous with 'fruit juice' and that term had a trade meaning as defined in the Food Standards Code . (The Food Standards Code is a reference to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code as defined in the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (Cth). The Food Standards Code , standard 2.6.1, with respect to fruit juice and vegetable juice, defined fruit juice or vegetable juice as the liquid portion, with or without pulp, obtained from fruit or vegetables respectively and in the case of citrus fruit, other than lime, the endocarp only of the fruit and included products that had been concentrated and later reconstituted with water to a concentration consistent with that of the undiluted juice from which it had been made. At [21] and [22], his Honour observed that it was common ground that the fruit drinks supplied by P &amp; N met the Food Standards Code requirements. It was also common ground that P &amp; N fruit drinks contained non-fruit based additives, vitamins and minerals or used processing aids within the limits permitted by the Food Standards Code . The evidence was that the fruit drinks contained 98% - 99% fruit juice and 1% - 2% additives and processing aids not directly derived from fruit.) (2) In substituting a trade meaning of 'fruit juice' for 'juices of fruits' that has no trade meaning, reliance was placed on Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 where the phrase 'silver dye bleach reversal process' in a tariff concession had no trade meaning but the words 'silver dye bleach process' did. The High Court held that the Tribunal's construction of the composite phrase by reference to the trade meaning of the lesser phrase and the ordinary meaning of the word 'reversal', involved no error of law. The submission, by parity of reasoning, was that in the Item 11 composite phrase 'wholly of juices of fruits', the word 'wholly' should be given its ordinary meaning and the words 'juices of fruits' (in both Items 11 and 12) should be given the trade meaning for 'fruit juice'. (3) That having adopted the Foods Standards Code prior to the introduction of the GST Act, its concepts were well known to the Parliament and that it may be taken to have had regard to them in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food. As to the reliance on Agfa-Gevaert in substituting a trade meaning of 'fruit juice' for 'juices of fruits', his Honour said at [27]: Agfa-Gevaert is quite different from the instant circumstances. The composite phrase was not one that had an obvious ordinary meaning. Nor did the lesser phrase. In those circumstances, the lesser [phrase] aided the proper interpretation of the composite one. Here, the words that comprise the composite phrase are words of common parlance, even if they are oddly arranged, and there is not the same need to call in aid a trade meaning. As to the submission that Parliament may be taken to have adopted the Food Standards Code and its trade meaning of 'fruit juice' in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food, his Honour said at [34] [35]: [34] ... Furthermore, the extrinsic materials do not suggest that parliament adopted a trade meaning in the Foods Standards Code . If it had, one would have expected it to have departed from the unusual [phrase] ""juices of fruits"". The extrinsic material makes it clear, in my view, that parliament intended to bring within the scope of the amendments to the GST Act the exemptions or concessions in relation to food products under the existing sales tax legislation. Hence the adoption of the phraseology in Item 11. [35] Parliament was invoking its past legislation rather than adopting a trade meaning of other words in an industry code that the past legislation preceded. The harking back to a phrase used in the sales tax legislation in 1935 leads to the irresistible conclusion that parliament was carrying forward some of the exemptions and concessions with respect to food in the sales tax legislation and not attributing to the phrase any trade meaning of a different term in the Foods Standards Code . There was no logical reason for parliament, in introducing a new tax, to adopt a code intended to ensure that the public was protected from poorly prepared food. The 2 objects are clearly distinct. If parliament had intended to adopt the code, one would have expected a collocation such as: ""non-alcoholic carbonated beverages produced wholly in accordance with the Foods Standards Code "".

cited,TelePacific Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 218 ALR 85,"The Tribunal has an obligation to give reasons that make it possible to understand its reasoning process. Failure to do so is an error of law ( Lang v Comcare (2007) 94 ALD 141 at [54]-[55] per Stone J citing TelePacific Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 218 ALR 85). This includes an obligation to give reasons for rejecting evidence that is plainly central to a party's claim and crucial to a medical report that supported that claim ( Lang at [54] per Stone J). As was pointed out by Stone J in Lang at [53] [55], the Tribunal is entitled to accept or reject the respective pieces of evidence before it or to accord certain pieces of evidence different weight. It is under no obligation to refer to all of the evidence before it. There is no obligation to make a finding on every question of fact that may be regarded as objectively material. The Tribunal is entitled to refer to all the medical reports, as Mr Sellick says the Tribunal did and to accept and reject evidence as it sees fit. The Tribunal is entitled to reject medical evidence or simply to prefer contrary medical evidence. It is obliged, however, to include in its reasons findings on all material questions of fact. Where a failure to give reasons makes it impossible to understand the Tribunal's reasoning process, that is an error of law."

referred to,"KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung ("" KM &amp; A Chadwick "") [1995] FCA 354","Mr Armitage stated on oath that the respondents made the arrangements that led to the retainer of legal representatives, who knew little or nothing of their case and took little or no responsibility for its ongoing conduct. This impeded the proper conduct of the litigation, as Mr Armitage apparently concedes. Parties to litigation such as Mr Armitage are obliged to take steps to keep themselves informed of the conduct of the litigation by their appointed legal representatives. They cannot escape their responsibility as parties with respect to the conduct of the litigation by hiding behind a poorly instructed lawyer retained briefly or at the last minute. Nor can they excuse themselves by relying on a series of ""unfortunate events"", as Mr Armitage sought to do. If it were otherwise, case management would prove virtually impossible: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354 ("" KM &amp; A Chadwick "") at [15] per Tamberlin J. 35 Ms Wu has, moreover, proceeded to the taxation contemplated by the orders in question, as indeed she was entitled to do. In so doing she has incurred further costs. In this regard, I note, however, that Mr Armitage has been most assiduous in contesting the taxation. His notice of appeal, which was filed on 24 February 2006, preceded the taxation hearings. 36 I am satisfied, however, that, taken as a whole, the circumstances are such as to justify me setting aside pars [2] and [3] the orders made on 3 February 2006: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick . 37 I would set aside par [3] of my orders principally because it was made in Mr Armitage's absence from the final stages of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion and costs application and will apparently operate to prevent Mr Armitage, who swears that he is impecunious, from advancing his defence. Having regard to the serious nature of some of the claims made against him and to the fact that he has apparently an arguable defence, it would not be in the interests of justice to make an order with such a result. That Ms Wu will suffer some inconvenience or hardship as a result is unavoidable. It is impossible to reconcile Ms Wu's interest in having the benefit of the orders previously with Mr Armitage's interest in having an opportunity to advance his defence. 38 For essentially the same reasons, I would also set aside par [2] of the 3 February orders. For the reasons set out below, I would order instead that, after judgment in this proceeding, Mr Armitage pay, on an indemnity basis, costs in the amount of $26,666.02 in respect of Ms Wu's motion. Further, I would order that Mr Armitage pay Ms Wu's costs of his motion. As will be seen below, although Mr Armitage has been partially successful in his motion, the need for such a motion arose from his failure to keep himself informed of the conduct of the proceeding on his behalf."
referred to,JB Williams Company v H Bronnley &amp; Co Limited (1909) 26 RPC 765,"In Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 514H-515C Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said that a trader could only claim protection for such capricious additions to a commonly used container as distinguished his use of that container from the use of other traders. Thus, the trader may prevent a rival copying the label on boxes or perhaps the distinctive combination of colours on tins but cannot stop the rival using ordinary boxes or tins simply because they happen to be the same shape and size as his. He said that it was not the shape and size of the container which identified the product of a particular trader to the public, but the capricious additions to it by way of distinctive labelling or a combination of colour or graphic design. He referred to JB Williams Company v H Bronnley &amp; Co Limited (1909) 26 RPC 765 at 771 per Cozens-Hardy MR and at 774 per Farwell LJ. In that case, at 773, Fletcher Moulton LJ had said there that the get-up of an article meant a capricious addition to the article itself, such as the colour or shape or wrapper or anything of that kind: see too Doctor Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (1999) 44 IPR 281 at 369 [339] per Goldberg J; and Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 515C-D per Lord Jauncey."
cited,Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1,"There is high authority against the supposed limitation on the exercise of the discretionary power to grant declaratory relief. In Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 the High Court, in respect of then current committal proceedings (ie actual, not hypothetical, criminal proceedings) made declarations that (i) certain documents were privileged from production and that (ii) the information laid against Mr Whitlam was bad in law. Gibbs ACJ said at 20-21: ""It is well established that the power of the court to make a declaration, under a provision such as s 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (N.S.W.), as amended, or O. 26, r. 19 of the Rules of this Court, is a very wide one: Forster v. Jododex Aust. Pty. Ltd . [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421, at pp 435-436 . It is clear enough that the power of the court is not excluded because the matter as to which a declaration is sought may fall for decision in criminal proceedings. Indeed in Dyson v. Attorney-General [1911] 1 KB 410, which is one of the foundations of the law on this subject, it was held that the court had power to make a declaration that the plaintiff was not under any obligation to comply with the requisitions contained in a notice sent to him by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, notwithstanding that neglect to comply with the notice was an offence see especially per Farwell L.J. [1911]1 KB, at p 422. Since that time there have been many cases in which the courts have made declarations in relation to questions which could have fallen for decision in criminal proceedings."" 57 His Honour observed (at 603) that while ordinarily a declaration is not made that a defendant has committed a crime, there was no doubt that there was jurisdiction to make such a declaration in a proper case: Imperial Tobacco Limited v Attorney-General [1981] AC 718 at 750, Sankey v Whitlam . Thus it was appropriate in many cases for a business person who is told by a regulatory authority that he or she cannot do something to apply for a declaration that the view is erroneous. Conversely, the right was mutual; the Crown could also obtain a declaration that the person's conduct contravened the law. That practice, which was common in New South Wales, had been given the ""seal of approval"" by the High Court in Australian Softwood ."

Nevertheless, his Honour's remarks at [87] were directed at the establishment of the regulatory scheme as a whole. He said that the Street Report and the Second Reading Speech point towards ""the establishment of the regulatory scheme as the means of addressing the negative aspects of legalised gambling."" He continued by saying: ""There is nothing in that material, or in the Act itself, to suggest that there should be a private right of action additional to the obligations imposed upon casino operators."""
cited,Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal [1990] HCA 31 ; (1990) 170 CLR 70,"In any event, where the basis for the alleged apprehension of bias applies to all judges of the Court, the doctrine of necessity applies so that a judge of this Court has to hear the application.

cited,GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1,"Although the phrase ""carries on a business"" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows: 1. ""Business"" in the context of s 2B is normally a ""wide and general"" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since ""business"" includes ""a business not carried on for profit"": NT Power 219 CLR at 116. 2. The phrase ""carries on a business"" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that ""with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia."" (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794). 3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, ""carrying on a business"" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451. 4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as ""carrying on a business"": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not ""carrying on a business"" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes ""carrying on a business"". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services. 5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] ."
cited,Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24,"I have proceeded upon the basis that greenhouse gas emissions consequent upon the burning of coal mined in one of these projects might arguably cause an impact upon a protected matter, which impact could be said to be an impact of the proposed action. I have adopted this approach because it appears to have been the approach adopted by Mr Flanigan. However I am far from satisfied that the burning of coal at some unidentified place in the world, the production of greenhouse gases from such combustion, its contribution towards global warming and the impact of global warming upon a protected matter, can be so described. The applicant's concern is the possibility that at some unspecified future time, protected matters in Australia will be adversely and significantly affected by climate change of unidentified magnitude, such climate change having been caused by levels of greenhouse gases (derived from all sources) in the atmosphere. There has been no suggestion that the mining, transportation or burning of coal from either proposed mine would directly affect any such protected matter, nor was there any attempt to identify the extent (if any) to which emissions from such mining, transportation and burning might aggravate the greenhouse gas problem. The applicant's case is really based upon the assertion that greenhouse gas emission is bad, and that the Australian government should do whatever it can to stop it including, one assumes, banning new coal mines in Australia. This case is far removed from the factual situation in Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24. 73 In the circumstances the application must be dismissed. I will hear submissions as to costs. I certify that the preceding seventy-three (73) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.

followed,Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397,"No point has been taken by the appellant as to the late filing of this Notice and, in light of the first respondent's attitude to the procedural defect identified in the Notice, no point of substance arises from the late filing of that Notice. As I have said, leave to appeal is required (see Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397). In order to secure leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment, an applicant must show that there is sufficient doubt as to the correctness of the judgment below to warrant review and, further, that, if the judgment below is found to be wrong, substantial injustice would be suffered by the applicant if leave to appeal were refused. 4 I will continue to refer to the appellant as ""the appellant"" notwithstanding the fact that I propose to deal with the matter upon the basis that the process filed constitutes an application for leave to appeal. Ms Weston, on behalf of the first respondent, accepts that I should approach the matter on the basis that the process filed is an application for leave to appeal from the Federal Magistrate's decision and I intend to deal with the matter on that basis. 5 The appellant is a citizen of China who arrived in Australia on 11 November 2007. On 4 December 2007 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. A delegate of the first respondent refused that application on 16 January 2008. On 31 January 2008 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. 6 In the proceedings before the Tribunal the appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of her practice of Falun Gong. She claimed before the Tribunal that she was introduced to Falun Gong in 2000, though she later stated she had been introduced to Falun Gong in 1997 by a customer in the shop where she worked. She said that in 2007 she was practising Falun Gong at a friend's house and that the police came and arrested them. She claimed that she had been detained for five days during which time she was tortured. She said that she was released when her husband paid a large sum of money, presumably to the authorities. 7 The Tribunal found that the appellant was not a credible witness. The Tribunal found that the appellant's evidence was inconsistent, implausible and confused and noted that in many instances she was not frank or forthcoming in the answers she gave."
followed,"Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 , 101 FCR 71","The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: ""(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action."" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it "" undermines or perverts "" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some "" unwritten law "" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ."
referred to,"Ishac v David Securities Pty Limited (No 5) (unreported, Young J, 24 March 1992)","In Ishac v David Securities Pty Limited (No 5) (unreported, Young J, 24 March 1992) His Honour listed four common situations where it is appropriate to allow further cross-examination. Only the first is relevant to the present case. It is where there is a bona fide omission by cross-examining counsel to deal with the subject and the omission comes to the cross-examiner's attention shortly after the witness has left the witness box. I do not consider that his Honour was attempting to lay down an exhaustive list. Rather, he set out guiding factors for the exercise of the discretion in situations which may be thought commonly to arise."

IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA NEW SOUTH WALES DISTRICT REGISTRY NSD 539 OF 2004 NSD 543 OF 2004 NSD 540 OF 2004 NSD 94 OF 2005 BETWEEN: IEL FINANCE LIMITED, QUEENSLAND TRADING AND HOLDING COMPANY LIMITED AND SPASSKED PTY LIMITED Applicants AND: COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION Respondent JUDGE : CONTI J DATE: 29 SEPTEMBER 2006 PLACE: SYDNEY REASONS FOR ORDERS On 21 March 2006 I directed the parties to the four subject proceedings ( IEL Finance Limited and Others v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 62 ATR 165) to provide draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment delivered on that prior occasion. The first of those four proceedings, being numbered NSD 539 of 2004 and involving IEL Finance Limited as applicant, was treated by the parties as the precedent vehicle, for the most part, for implementation of orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings. The abbreviations adopted in these reasons reflect those used in the preceding principal reasons for judgment of 21 March 2006. There appears to be no controversy between the relevant parties regarding the content of the first order to be made in all four proceedings brought of course at the instance of the applicable applicant. Nor is there controversy as to consequential orders numbered 4 to 7 concerning grant of leave to the applicant in all four proceedings to file the amended pleading and to the Commissioner filing a subsequent reply. Where controversy lies is in relation to the nature and scope of the order required to give effective operation as to the implications of the strike-out of the foregoing paragraphs of amended statement of facts, issues and contentions (the proposed order 2) and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment (the proposed order 3). As to what version of Order 3 as to costs should be made, the Commissioner pointed out that IEF had made no submissions at the hearing in relation to the Commissioner's claim that '[t]he applicant pay the respondent's (ie Commissioners) costs of this motion and of the application', nor led evidence concerning the need to apportion costs incurred by the respondent between issues of additional and primary tax'. The Commissioner referred to [130] of my reasons for judgment where I held that the '[t] he Commissioner must have the costs of the proceedings to date, inclusive of the costs related to the present summary application' , and submitted that the text of the orders now sought should 'reflect that finding precisely' . I think that the Commissioner's submission is correct and reflects the substance of the outcome and the implications of my principal findings made earlier on 21 March 2006 in the IEL Finance principal proceedings ( ante ). Accordingly I have made the orders in each proceedings essentially as proposed by the Commissioner. I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.

followed,VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158,"As the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal are relevant to decide whether leave to appeal should be granted (see VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] - [48] ), it is appropriate first to address the proposed grounds of appeal to assess their merits. Realistically, as counsel for the first respondent acknowledged, if those grounds of appeal are likely to result in success on the appeal and the quashing of the decision of the Tribunal, given the significant implications to the appellant of the present decision of the Tribunal which would have him return to Bangladesh, there would be strong reason to allow the proposed grounds of appeal to be pursued: cf SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 at [66] ; NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51."
considered,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24,"In support of these submissions, Mr Bryant pointed to observations by Mason J (as he then was) in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24 at 41 to the effect that a court may set aside an administrative decision that has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, on the ground that the decision is manifestly unreasonable. It was also noted, by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Ors (1989) 18 ALD 679 and Riddle v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 58 ; (2006) 149 FCR 348 , that these principles apply equally to a decision of the Tribunal."

In submissions, the Commissioner referred to the fact that in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Brown [1999] FCA 1198 ; 99 ATC 4852 at [12] a Full Court of this Court referred to that matter as an 'important consideration'; an applicant should show that he or she has an 'arguable case' to warrant an extension of time: Brown , at first instance [1999] FCA 563 ; , 99 ATC 4516 at [56] per Hill J, accepting the view of von Doussa J in Windshuttle v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1993] FCA 553 ; (1993) 46 FCR 235 at 243."
cited,SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034,"The First Respondent says that since the Appellant 'republished' the relevant information to the Tribunal for the purposes of the application before the Tribunal, the Tribunal acted in a way entirely consistent with the principles identified in the following decisions of the Full Court of the Federal Court; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27; and SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; and the principles identified by the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162; and notions of 'republication', discussed in the following decisions of the Federal Court; SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034 ; and SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 611."
applied,Adam P. Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Phillip Morris Inc (1981) 148 CLR 170,"It is common ground that in ruling upon this application, the Court is to apply the test established by the High Court in Adam P. Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Phillip Morris Inc (1981) 148 CLR 170 which requires the respondent to persuade the Court that the discharge of the undertaking would be appropriate because of the existence of new facts that render the ongoing enforcement of the undertaking unjust. 4 The respondent carries the burden of establishing the new facts. Mr McDonald of Senior Counsel, who appeared on behalf of the respondent with Mr O'Grady, argued that there were two material changes in circumstances which rendered it unjust for the Court to maintain the undertaking of the respondent. 5 First, Mr McDonald contended that the cause of action under s 1317AA of the Act had been abandoned by the legal representative of the applicant in the course of the trial, which is presently part heard. Reference was made to the transcript at pp 22 and 50 which support the contention that this cause of action was abandoned in the course of the trial."

cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd (2000) ATPR 41-763,"Depending on the circumstances of the case, other principles may also be relevant. Where the relevant conduct gives rises to several contraventions of the TPA, it will be relevant to take into account the totality principle to ensure that the total penalty does not exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct in question: see Trade Practices Commission v Advance Bank Australia Ltd (1993) ATPR 41-229 ( 'Advance Bank' ) at 41,164 per Gummow J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169 ( 'ABB Transmission' ) at 179-180 [38]-[39]; TNT at 40,169. The parity principle, ie all other things being equal, similar conduct should be deserving of similar penalties, will have direct application where penalties are being imposed on several contravening respondents. The principle also draws attention, albeit less directly, to the penalties that have been imposed in past cases. There is, of course, a limit to the usefulness of any comparison with past penalties: the circumstances of particular cases are likely to differ in significant respects and each case must be considered by reference to its own circumstances: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd (2000) ATPR 41-763 ( 'George Weston' ) at 40,984 [31] per Goldberg J. 51 I have already observed that the CEPU was aware that DJN performed work at Loy Yang B, that it did not have an EBA with the CEPU, and that the provision proposed by the CEPU for Edison's agreement would operate to exclude DJN from working at Loy Yang B so long as it did not enter into an EBA with the CEPU. Edison was also aware of these matters. As events transpired, DJN was the only electrical contractor affected by the arrangement over the period between August 2001 and December 2003. However, the impact of the arrangement was potentially wider than this. In my opinion, it is appropriate to have regard to the fact that the arrangement was general in terms, and that the exclusionary provision had the potential to prevent any electrical contractor being retained by Edison to perform work at Loy Yang B if the contractor did not obtain or maintain a current certified agreement with the CEPU. In Rural Press at 43,296 [46], Mansfield J pointed out that even in cases where the contravening conduct was not carried through to its conclusion and therefore no loss resulted, courts have taken into account the potential harm in determining the seriousness of the offence; see also George Weston and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cromford Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-618."

There is merit in the submission.

distinguished,Gilmour v AMP General Insurance (1997) 9 ANZIC 61-372 ,"MDRN seeks to narrow the construction of cl 5(e)(v) of the St Paul policy, submitting that it does not operate to deprive an innocent partner of indemnity where loss is the result of the dishonest or fraudulent act of an employee. The point is clearly unarguable. Clause 5(e)(v) specifically excludes indemnity where the loss occurs in those circumstances. The argument would result in the clause having no effect whatsoever. MDRN sought to rely upon the decision of the Full Court of South Australia in Gilmour v AMP General Insurance (1997) 9 ANZIC 61-372. However it is relatively clear that the case did not involve a clause such as cl 5(e)(v). There is nothing in this argument. 611. As I understand it, my findings lead to the conclusion that St Paul is obliged to indemnify MDRN only in the amount of Mr Bengston's claim. However I will invite the parties to make further submissions should they wish to do so. 612. One other matter requires comment. St Paul submits that the fees charged by Mr Jessup are not recoverable by the applicants. The applicants do not claim them as damages. However they were deducted from moneys received by Mr Jessup and so the amount thereof was not passed on to investors. The amount of each claim has been increased as a result of such deduction."

That decision was considered by the High Court in Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389. The Court said at 395: Some recent Federal Court decisions have attempted to distil the numerous authorities on the problem into a number of general propositions. Thus in Pozzolanic, after referring to many cases, the Court identified five general propositions: ""1. The question whether a word or phrase in a statute is to be given its ordinary meaning or some technical or other meaning is a question of law. 2. The ordinary meaning of a word or its non-legal technical meaning is a question of fact. 3. The meaning of a technical legal term is a question of law. 4. The effect or construction of a term whose meaning or interpretation is established is a question of law. 5. The question whether facts fully found fall within the provision of a statutory enactment properly construed is generally a question of law."" (Footnotes omitted.)"
discussed,McGowan v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2003] FCA 482 ; (2003) 129 FCR 118,"The Commonwealth could not refer me to any case in which the Court has made an order under O 29 r 2 for the separate trial of the question whether declaratory relief should be refused as a matter of discretion, prior to any consideration of the merits of the claim for declaratory relief. It did, however, refer me to McGowan v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2003] FCA 482 ; (2003) 129 FCR 118 ( 'McGowan' ) which concerned the dismissal of a judicial review application. 67 In McGowan , the applicant sought judicial review of a decision by the Migration Agents Registration Authority to suspend her registration as a migration agent until she satisfied certain conditions. The applicant made an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under s 306 of the Migration Act for a merits review of the Authority's decision to suspend her registration some days before she instituted proceedings in the Federal Court seeking judicial review of the Authority's decision. The application was founded principally on the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 ( 'ADJR Act' ), but also relied in the alternative on s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act . The relief sought by the applicant included an order pursuant to s 16(1) of the ADJR Act setting aside or quashing the Authority's decision, and in the alternative, orders by way of prohibition and injunction pursuant to s 39B."
cited,Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning (Aust) Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947,"The degree of annexation test looks to the manner in which the object is attached to the land. If the object is attached to the land, other than by its own weight, there is a rebuttable presumption that it forms part of the land. The greater the degree of annexation, the stronger the presumption. If on the other hand, the object is attached only by its own weight, there is a rebuttable presumption that it is not part of the land, even if it has become embedded in the soil. In such a case the onus lies upon the person claiming that the object forms part of the land to prove that it was erected with the intention that it should become part of the land: Reid v Smith [1905] HCA 54 ; (1905) 3 CLR 656 at 668, 673-4, 675-6; Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning (Aust) Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947 at 950-1. The courts will infer the degree of annexation from the surrounding circumstances including the nature of the object and the nature of the interest held in the land by the owner of the object. The test is objective, namely, what a reasonable person would consider to be the reason for attaching the object to the land. 70 Further the proper formulation of the test is not whether damages are an adequate remedy but whether it is just in all the circumstances that the plaintiff should be confined to his remedy in damages. The courts have recognised there may be cases in which it is unjust to confine a plaintiff to its remedy in damages because of, for example, the difficulty in estimating damages and damages which cannot be taken into monetary account such as loss of goodwill and trade reputation: Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947 at 954-5, citing Evans Marshall &amp; Co Ltd v Bertola SA and Sherry Imports Ltd [1973] 1 WLR 349."
considered,"Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Laing (1998) 89 FCR 17 ","The conduct identified in paras (a) and (d) would, almost certainly, have been the conduct of employers or employees. However the conduct identified in paras (b) and (c) may have been the conduct of others. In Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Laing (1998) 89 FCR 17 at 30-31, French J observed, concerning a similar provision in the WR Act: While par (a) of the definition relates to the ""performance of work"", par (b) is more broadly expressed. It refers to ""a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on the acceptance of or offering for work"". The central meaning of the term ""ban"" in the industrial, as in its ordinary usage, is to ""prohibit or interdict"": the Macquarie Dictionary. Communication between persons or an organization and persons is essential to a ""ban"". And while the notion of ""limitation"" or ""restriction"" may have a meaning related to manner of actual performance of work, that meaning is picked up in par (a) of the definition. Under par (b) it extends to the communication of a limitation or restriction. Communication picked up under pars (b) and (c) must no doubt purport to be at least hortatory, if not authoritative and binding, upon the person or persons to whom they are directed. In the ordinary course such communication will be verbal whether oral, written or in electronic form. Being intended to affect or affecting the performance of work, it is industrial action because of its instrumental character. Notwithstanding that it is communication it falls within the terms of the definition. 51 At 32, his Honour continued: So a picket line whose purpose is to prevent or deter or discourage employees from attending on their employer's premises and from carrying out their work could constitute a ban for the purposes of s 127."""

cited,State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282,"The majority said, at [55]: The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s 51(xx). It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. (Plainly, a foreign corporation is a corporation formed outside the limits of the Commonwealth.) No party or intervener called in question what was said about trading and financial corporations in R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] , Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 ; 40 ALR 609] , State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [(1982) [1982] HCA 72 ; 150 CLR 282 ; 44 ALR 1] or Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; [(1983) 152 CLR 570 ; 46 ALR 41]. 69 The submissions on behalf of the applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 refer to cases decided by the High Court that have considered the question of whether particular entities are trading or financial corporations: a football club in Adamson's case ; a statutory corporation generating and selling electricity in Commonwealth v State of Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 158 CLR 1 ( Tasmanian Dams case); a State Corporation conducting financial trading activities in order to finance and operate a superannuation scheme in State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 ; and a dormant shelf company which had not yet commenced to trade in any capacity in Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8. The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations; nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive: State Superannuation Board at 303. 147 I note, nonetheless, that in the State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 , Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ said, at 303: ... [T]he decision in Adamson is of importance for two reasons. First, the majority of the Court (Barwick CJ, Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ), rejecting the argument that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is the sole or principal criterion of its character as a trading corporation. 148 This passage indicates that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is not the ""sole"" or ""principal"" criterion for the purposes of characterisation. The passage suggests, however, that the purpose of the formation of a corporation is not irrelevant in that process. 149 The contention for the applicant in both proceedings in this case is that when one looks at the totality of the evidence, including the historical evidence concerning the function of the Etheridge Shire Council, in particular, the fundamental functions of the shire council, being the legislative and administrative responsibility as a local government for the local government area, it is impossible to conclude that the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation. 150 I have set out in detail the evidence in relation to what is said to be the trading activities of the council. 151 All of them, in my opinion, including even the road works aspect of the activity of the council, after close analysis, entirely lack the essential quality of trade. Almost all of them run at a loss. They are all directed, in my view, to public benefit objectives within the shire. Their scale, even in monetary terms (putting to one side the non-monetary significance of the legislative and executive activity of the shire council), are so inconsequential and incidental to the primary activity and function of the Council as to the deny to the Council the characterisation of a ""trading corporation"" or a ""financial corporation""."
followed,SmithKline Beecham PLC v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 271,"The share account statements referred to in paragraph 47 of the affidavit of Ian Carey dated 5 November 2007. The Respondent's Notice of Motion seeking to set aside this Notice to Produce is that filed on 14 December 2007. 2 Also before the Court is an oral application made by the Respondent seeking to set aside a second Notice to Produce served by the Applicants and dated 1 February 2008. That Notice to Produce seeks the production of: Advice from Naomi Sharp dated 20 December 2007. 3 The first Notice to Produce , dated 29 November 2007, invokes Order 15A, rule 6 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), which provides as follows: Discovery from prospective respondent Where: (a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision; the Court may order that that person shall make discovery to the applicant of any document of the kind described in paragraph (c). The present provision of relevance is paragraph (c) and the discretion conferred. 4 Argument this morning proceeded upon the basis that the success or failure of the Motion could be tested by looking at the first document described in the Notice to Produce , namely, the statement of the two accounts. The Affidavit of Ian Carey referred to in the Notice to Produce , being that sworn on 5 November 2007, provided in paragraph 10 as follows: In January 2000, the deposit from the sale of the 37 Carr Street property (after deduction of the agent's commission) of $120,432 had been paid into my bank account at Bank of Melbourne by mistake. This account was later closed and the funds transferred to another account of mine in Australia. 5 On behalf of the Respondent it was submitted that Rule 6(c) required a three stage progression namely: 1) an inquiry as to whether there was "" reasonable cause to believe ""; 2) whether there were any documents in the possession of his client, or likely to have been in the possession of his client, relating to the question of whether the Applicants had a "" right to obtain the relief ""; and 3) the exercise of the Court's discretion, that discretion being conferred by the phrase "" the Court may order "". Left to one side has been the resolution of any question as to whether compliance with previous orders of this Court, or non-compliance, could contribute to the Court forming a view that there was a "" reasonable cause to believe "". 6 For present purposes it was accepted by the Respondent that the bank accounts referred to in paragraph 10 of the Affidavit indicated that there were documents likely to have been in the possession of the Respondent, and that such documents could "" relat [e] to "" the question of whether the Applicants had a "" right to obtain the relief "". Attention on behalf of the Respondent was thus focused upon the exercise of the Court's discretion. 7 Considerable caution must be exercised in ordering the production of documents in circumstances where the application before the Court is an order under Order 15A of the Federal Court Rules . In SmithKline Beecham PLC v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 271 Finkelstein J observed: [19] O15A is designed to enable a person to determine whether he has a good cause of action against a prospective defendant. It is not designed to secure for a prospective plaintiff all the documents and other information that would be discoverable if a proceeding were commenced against the defendant. Nevertheless, some ""fishing"" must be permitted, for otherwise there will be little scope for the operation of the rule. Speaking generally, however, once a person is in a position to make a decision whether he has a good (or perhaps arguable) cause of action, the criteria to be satisfied before an order can be made under O15A, r6 will not be satisfied. 8 In the circumstances of the present case, however, it is considered that the Applicants fall within the ambit of Order 15A, rule 6 and that the discretion should be exercised in their favour. Relevant to the exercise of the discretion is the potential importance of the documents which have been sought in the resolution of the question as to whether the Applicants have a right to obtain relief. The statements of the two accounts referred to in paragraph 10 of the Respondent's Affidavit , it is considered, are of considerable potential importance. 9 In the absence of any distinction being drawn between the documents identified in paragraph 1, as opposed to the Notice to Produce generally, it is thus considered that production should be ordered of all of those documents identified in paragraphs 1 7 of the first Notice to Produce . 10 The second Notice to Produce , dated 1 February 2008, seeks the production of an advice from Naomi Sharp of counsel."
referred to,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"The meaning and implications of the statutory notion of 'decision', where used in the ADJR Act, was comprehensively explained by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321. It was emphasised by Mason CJ at 335 (with whose reasons Brennan J agreed, as did Deane J other than in relation to a particular matter not here material) that such meaning must be determined by reference to the text, scope and purpose of the legislation, and further that the remedial nature of the ADJR Act indicates that no narrow view is to be taken of the notion of 'decision' in that statutory context. Moreover his Honour pointed out at 336 that the concept of 'a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises, rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision', and further that 'the examples of a decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 3(2) [of the ADJR Act] are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, [being] an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute ...'. Section 3(3) of the ADJR Act, which extends the statutory definition of 'decision' to '... the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power ', was said by his Honour to operate to '... qualif[y] the characteristic of finality'. Moreover the Chief Justice explained that '... acts done preparatory to the making of a ""decision"" are not to be regarded as constituting ""decisions"" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of ""conduct"" as well as of a ""decision"".' 28 In the further course of his reasons for judgment in Bond at 337, Mason CJ pointed out that '... a reviewable ""decision"" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute', which '... will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration', so long of course '... that it be a substantive determination', as opposed to 'procedural determinations'. 29 The applicants focused those explanations and expositions of the Chief Justice upon s 111 of the Act, which refers to power conferred upon the Authority inter alia to revoke or vary any condition of a licence which it may have previously imposed, and submitted that so much did not mean that a refusal to exercise any such positive power on the part of the Authority did not constitute a decision made under s 111. It was pointed out in that regard, in my opinion rightly, that there are many statutes in which the decision-making power is expressed only in terms of a positive discretion, without express reference to the power to make a decision of a negative character, yet in such cases it is necessarily implicit that a negative decision would also be made under that provision. Otherwise, so it was further emphasised by the present applicants, paras (a), (b) and (g) of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act would be otiose. Those subsections read as follows (the emphasis appearing in non-italics is mine): 's 3(2) In this Act, a reference to the making of a decision includes a reference to: (a) making, suspending, revoking or refusing to make an order, award or determination; (b) giving, suspending, revoking or refusing to give a certificate, direction, approval, consent or permission; ... (g) doing or refusing to do any other act or thing...' 31 The Authority sought to deny any conclusion as to the existence of a justiciable decision by characterising its first decision as declining to even consider the exercise of any discretion under s 111 of the Act. In the applicants' submission that purported characterisation was misconceived, and must be rejected, for the following reasons: (i) the decision not to exercise its power under s 111 to vary a condition of the licence was indeed final, operative and determinative, in the practical sense described in Bond and in Right to Life [cedilla] of AusCoast's ability to continue to broadcast under the auspices of the 1620 licence from the current site at Tingalpa; (ii) any such characterisation sits at least uncomfortably with the terms of the Authority's letter of 30 June 2005, containing as it does the assertion '[a]s a result the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]'; (iii) the decision not to exercise the power was one which was authorised by and therefore made under s 111 of the Act, since s 111 confers a discretionary power, and hence contemplates that a decision whether or not to exercise that discretion could be made, there being no other source of power for such a decision. I think that there is force in each of the foregoing submissions of the applicants. 48 Ryan J found that the Minister there had not received advice from a local Aboriginal community in accordance with s 21D(1), and thus the issue of relevance was whether or not the Minister's decision not to determine[e] on his...own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made was a reviewable decision for the purposes of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act. The Minister had informed the applicants in writing that he would 'consider' their request for a determination on his own motion, but later told the applicants that he would not do so pending the resolution of another proceeding before this Court involving the same artefacts. His Honour found that the Minister's decision was a decision to decline to determine[e]...on his own motion and was thus made 'preparatory' to the making of a decision to determine to make a temporary declaration. Alternatively, his Honour characterised the decision declining to so determine[e] as 'a conclusion reached as a step on the way to an ultimate decision', which is not reviewable, for that reason also, thereby referring to dicta to like effect at 337 of Mason CJ's reasons for judgment in Bond . 59 Thus by way of reflection of the dictum I have cited from Bond , the communications of the Authority as evidenced from the outset by its faxed response of 16 August 2004 to the applicants' application of 6 August 2004 and thereafter, inclusive of its critical communication to WAL of 30 June 1995, the Authority indicated to the applicants the position which it had adopted or taken as inherently and essentially indicative of decision-making on its part, the same having for instance the 'character or quality of finality', and constituting and involving 'an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application' within the scope of that dictum of Mason CJ in Bond I have earlier cited. That communication of the Authority constituted or involved a decision 'at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration'. It was 'a substantive determination' as opposed to a 'procedural determination', to adopt the Chief Justice's further dictum in Bond ."
applied,The Architects (Australia) Pty Ltd v Witty Consultants Pty Ltd [2002] QSC 139,"these different objectives, it is not uncommon for a plaintiff to place reliance upon both s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and the tort of passing off: e.g. The Architects (Australia) Pty Ltd v Witty Consultants Pty Ltd [2002] QSC 139. There are "" close similarities "" between the two causes of action: Osgaig Pty Ltd v Ajisen (Melbourne) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1394 at [80] , [2004] FCA 1394 ; 213 ALR 153 at 167 per Weinberg J. Indeed, authorities which have considered the common law tort of passing off provide guidance by analogy as to the type of conduct which would be likely to mislead or deceive the public for the purposes of s 52: R &amp; C Products Pty Ltd v SC Johnson &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 198 ; (1993) 42 FCR 188 at 192 per Davies J. The tort has been applied in more recent times to circumstances in which a defendant passes off his goods or services as those of the plaintiff by means of an impermissible use of a domain name: e.g. The Architects (Australia) [2002] QSC 139 at [34] per Chesterman J. In determining whether a plaintiff has established distinctiveness in the name or names with which it contends that the goodwill which it seeks to protect has become associated, useful guidance is provided by the following observations of Hill J in Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1989] FCA 506 ; (1989) 16 IPR 431 at 448: Just as the distinction between descriptive and fancy names is not a distinction of law so too it is wrong to see the distinction in black and white terms. The reality is that there is a continuum with at the extremes purely descriptive names at the one end, completely invented names at the other and in between, names that contain ordinary English words that are in some way or other at least partly descriptive. The further along the continuum towards the fancy name one goes, the easier it will be for a plaintiff to establish that the words used are descriptive of the plaintiff's business. The closer along the continuum one moves towards a merely descriptive name the more a plaintiff will need to show that the name has obtained a secondary meaning, equating it with the products of the plaintiff (if the name admits of this &#8212; a purely descriptive name probably will not) and the easier it will be to see a small difference in names as adequate to avoid confusion. There need not be an exact or even substantial similarity in the nature of the two businesses: The Architects (Australia) [2002] QSC 139 at [27] to [28] per Chesterman J. The reference to the "" Performing Right Society test "" is a reference to Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd [1924] 1 KB 1 at 15 where Atkin LJ said: If the directors themselves directed or procured the commission of the act they would be liable in whatever sense they did so, whether expressly or impliedly. In Microsoft Corporation v Auschina Polaris Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 231 at 243 to 244, Lindgren J said of this test: The ""procured or directed"" test, sometimes referred to as the ""authorised, procured or directed"" test, focuses attention on the relationship between the director's intention and the particular corporate conduct which the law characterises as tortious. What seems to underlie this test is the notion that, necessarily, companies can engage in tortious conduct only through human beings, and, at least ordinarily, where a particular human being involved and responsible to an appropriate extent can be identified, he should, as a matter of policy, be liable. After all, even if the aggrieved party did not sue him, apparently he would be liable to indemnify the company in respect of its liability to the aggrieved party. A director who "" procures or directs "" his company to perform a tortious act may thus be liable along with his company: The Architects (Australia) Pty Ltd [2002] QSC 139 at [51] per Chesterman J."
cited,"SZHFE v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648","is unnecessary to resolve a third contention advanced by the Minister.

cited,Dowling v St Vincent De Paul Society of Victoria Inc [2003] VSC 454,"In Dowling v St Vincent De Paul Society of Victoria Inc [2003] VSC 454 Nettle J took a somewhat more restrictive view of the breadth of s 19(1)(f) of the Trustee Act 1958 (Vic) being the comparable Victorian provision. That case concerned the efficacy of an agreement to compromise a probate proceeding in which the validity of a will was contested. The question was whether s 19(1)(f) authorised the executors to enter into the compromise in anticipation of a grant of probate. Nettle J reached the view that s 19(1)(f) did not authorise an executor to compromise a dispute as to the validity of a will without the consent of affected parties or an order of the Court that bound them. At [19] his Honour said: '19 Despite what has been said about the breadth of s 19(1)(f) I do not consider that s 19(1)(f) empowers an executor as such to compromise a probate proceeding in which the validity of the will is contested.' His Honour continued at [21]: '21 The word ""claim"" is capable in some contexts of including almost any sort of demand. Equally, according to context, the conception of things which relate to an estate may include a very broad range of possible subject matters. But it requires no recitation of authority to establish that the words of a statutory provision are to be read in context and according to the apparent purpose of the provision. And in their context and according to what I perceive to [be] the purpose of the s 19 of the Trustee Act , ""claims relating to ... the estate"" appear as limited to claims upon or against the estate. With respect, I think the observations of Sir Robert Megarry VC in Re Earl of Strafford to be persuasive. The section is concerned with claims against the estate be they from the outside world or as between the beneficiaries not proceedings to determine the title of the executor or trustee.' 91 It may be seen from the above that Nettle J took the view that the relevant section could lead to compromises of claims by the relevant trustees or against them."
cited,Re Gillies [1993] FCA 289 ; (1993) 115 ALR 631,"Section 131 has been repealed. However, the Bankruptcy Act still contemplates that income earned after the bankrupt's bankruptcy does not vest in the bankrupt's trustee: Re Gillies [1993] FCA 289 ; (1993) 115 ALR 631 at 636-637. Whilst the trustee may require the bankrupt to make contributions out of the bankrupt's income, the Bankruptcy Act contemplates that those contributions will be made out of income in the hands of the bankrupt not the trustee. 73 The position therefore is no different from the position when s 131 was part of the Bankruptcy Act or s 101 part of the 1924 Bankruptcy Act . The bankrupt's income, after bankruptcy, does not vest in the bankrupt's trustee. 74 If the bankrupt's income does not vest in the trustee, it must be because it is not property or at least property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. 82 The Court went on to say: A convenient summary of these provisions is to be found in the reasons of French J in Re Gillies; Ex parte Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [1993] FCA 289 ; (1993) 42 FCR 571. In that case his Honour held that although s 131(1) which had entitled ""a bankrupt who is in receipt of income"" to retain it for his own benefit had been repealed, Div 4B ""rests upon the continuing assumption that the income of the bankrupt does not vest in the trustee"". We are in respectful agreement with that view; but it does not, of course, bear upon the question whether a cause of action for breach of a contract which would, if carried out, have produced income for the bankrupt vests in the trustee."
cited,Abebe v Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510,finding of the Tribunal in this regard was open to it on the evidence. The weight the Tribunal gives to any piece of evidence is a matter for it to decide and there is no scope for judicial review simply because another decision-maker might give greater or lesser weight to a particular matter: see Abebe v Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 580 and NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at 440. The Court may not engage in fact-finding about the merits of the appellant's case.
cited,Aljade and MKIC v OCBC [2004] VSC 351,"That assessment will take account of the complexity of the issues and the basis upon which the Court resolved the controversy. Although an applicant may have been unsuccessful in obtaining the relief sought, the applicant may have successfully resisted a significant proportion of what was said to be an answer to the relief claimed. An applicant may have established the integers of the cause of action upon which the relief is based yet relief may be refused on discretionary grounds. Although in an absolute sense, a respondent simply seeks to resist the relief sought in the proceeding and any successful ground of doing so is sufficient , the basis upon which the Court resolves the controversy assists in understanding whether an unsuccessful applicant acted reasonably in electing to proceed and thus assume the risk of a less favourable outcome than that available when choosing to go on. The letter of offer need not nor should it, engage in an analysis of the underlying contentions. The focus of the letter is to put the offer in clear and precise terms so that the recipient can understand what is offered and the Court can later see without obfuscation just exactly what was offered and rejected. As to the general principles see: Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333 ; Cutts v Head [1984] 2 WLR 349; Aljade and MKIC v OCBC [2004] VSC 351 ; SMEC Testing Services Pty Ltd v Campbelltown City Council [2000] NSWCA 323 ; County Securities Pty Ltd v Challenger Group Holdings Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2008] NSWCA 273 ; and Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72."
referred to,Re Wilcox; ex parte Venture Industries Pty Limited (1996) 66 FCR 511,"other legislative provisions on which SOG and the administrators rely state the criteria for the exercise of the power to transfer proceedings in terms which may be said to be less prescriptive than under the cross-vesting legislation. The power to transfer under the Trade Practices Act is stated in discretionary terms. In Re Wilcox; ex parte Venture Industries Pty Limited (1996) 66 FCR 511 at 529, the Full Court said that: [A] manifest object of the cross-vesting legislative scheme as enacted by the Commonwealth in 1987 was for the [ Trade Practices Act ] and the [ Cross-Vesting Act ] to provide separate, albeit overlapping, but additional sources ... of power ...

considered,Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328,"In regard to the construction and application of Table 13.1 in the Approved Guide, Mr Bryant's submission was that the Tribunal's reliance on an earlier Tribunal decision, O'Rourke v Comcare [1997] AATA 304 , led it to apply an incorrect construction of the term ""minor interference"". Mr Byrant's submissions proceeded as follows. The global approach to ""minor interference"" in O'Rourke v Comcare , is contrary to the approach the Court has taken to interpreting the Guide in Whittaker v Comcare [1998] FCA 1099 ; (1998) 86 FCR 532 and Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328. These cases are, it was submitted, supportive of the proposition that, where there is ambiguity in a phrase, as there is with ""minor interference"", then the Tribunal should take the approach most favourable to the employee. If the global approach in O'Rourke v Comcare has the effect of limiting or reading down the meaning of ""minor interference"" then it ought not be followed. If an ""activity of daily living"" (ADL) is interrupted, temporarily suspended or ceased altogether because of a headache that amounted, it was submitted, to an interference and whether it is minor or significant depended on the frequency, duration and severity of attacks. Where headaches amount to more than a de minimus interference with ADL, it was submitted that this would then constitute a ""minor interference"". It was submitted that Mr Bryant's medical history, as provided to Dr Lethlean, which history was assumed to be uncontroversial, would fall within the meaning of ""minor interference"" so construed and hence amounted to a 10% impairment under Table 13.1 of the Approved Guide. 29 On behalf of the Commission, it was submitted that the comparison between the term ""difficulty"", as considered in Whittaker v Comcare and Comcare v Fiedler , and the term ""interference"" as used in Table 13.1 of the Approved Guide was not appropriate to support a de minumus argument. In support, the Commission pointed to the observation of the Full Court in Fiedler at [24] that, ""There is no reason to think the Tribunal considered that any difficulty with digital dexterity, no matter how slight, was sufficient to come within par 1 of Table 9.4""."
applied,D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385,"The ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument are applicable to the construction of the specification of a patent: Nobel's Explosives Co Ltd v Anderson (1894) 11 RPC 519 at 523; D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 (' D&eacute;cor ') at 391, 400; Photocure at [168]. However, there are also a number of special considerations that are relevant to the construction of a patent. The general basis for these rules was explained by Hely J in Beltreco at [70]: 'A patent is a public instrument which grants the right to protection of a defined monopoly, for the consideration of the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society. It is the need for balance between these symbiotic, yet competing interests which underscores the rules of patent construction.' 16 It is well established that the claims contained in the specification set out the legal limits of the monopoly. Yet, when construing the claims and determining the nature and extent of this monopoly it is necessary to consider the context in which the claims are made. This requires a consideration of the specification as a whole even if there is no apparent ambiguity in the claim; Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 (' Minnesota Mining ') at 267-272; D&eacute;cor at 410-411; Beltreco at [75]-[78]. The specification is made up of several parts which have different functions: Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 (' Welch Perrin ') at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Beltreco at [73]. Nevertheless, reference to it as a whole may explain or elucidate the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of a technical term or in resolving ambiguities in the construction of claims: Martin v Scribal Pty Ltd [1954] HCA 48 ; (1954) 92 CLR 17 (' Martin ') per Taylor J at 97; Welch Perrin at 610-611; Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd (1939) 56 RPC 23 (' Electric &amp; Musical Industries ') at 41-42, Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 (' Interlego ') at 478-479; D&eacute;cor at 400; Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 479 (' Sartas ') at 486; Beltreco at [75]. 17 It is important, however, that the focus of the inquiry remain on the claims under consideration. If claims are clear and unambiguous, they are not to be varied, qualified or made obscure by statements found in other parts of the patent: Welch Perrin at 610; Interlego at 478-479; Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 41; Rosedale Associated Manufacturers Ltd v Carlton Tyre Saving Co Ltd [1960] RPC 59 at 69; Cooper Industries Inc v Metal Manufactures Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 106 at 113; Lantech Inc v First Green Park Pty Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 327 at 333; Beltreco at [74]. It is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of the monopoly as fixed by the words of the claims by adding to those words a gloss drawn from other parts of the specification: Welch Perrin at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Braas &amp; Co GmbH v Humes Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 273 at 284; Beltreco at [74]. 18 A patent specification should be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction: Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 (' Catnic ') at 242-243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Improver Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181 (' Improver '); Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1989-1990) 16 IPR 545 at 560-561; Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd v M W A Holdings Pty Ltd (1970) 44 ALJR 385 at 388; Beltreco at [81]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoeschst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 (' Kirin-Amgen '); Sachtler at [43]-[67]. It is inappropriate, however, to approach construction of the specification with a view to being 'fair' to the patentee; Kirin-Amgen at [33]; Sachtler at [60]. The fact that the monopoly is granted in consideration for the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society must be recognised: Beltreco at [70]. Indeed, the principles governing a definition of a monopoly operating over the public at large require a description of the claims that 'is not reasonably capable of misunderstanding': Martin at 59. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct prohibited: British United Shoe Machinery Co Ltd v A Fussell &amp; Sons Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 631 at 650-651. The public are entitled to be able to design around the monopoly claimed in a patent and therefore they must be able to determine reliably the scope of the claims: Beloit Technologies Inc v Valmat Paper Machinery Inc [1895] 24 RPC 705 at 720. 20 The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date: Welch Perrin at 610; Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 (' Populin ') at 476-477; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 103 ALR 239 at 260; D&eacute;cor at 397; Stanway Oyster Cylinders Pty Ltd v Marks (1996) 66 FCR 577 at 582-583; Beltreco at [81]; Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [24] ; Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care South East Asia Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 442 at [113]; Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 477 at 496; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 513 (' NV Philips ') at 531; Catnic at 225; Wheatley (Davina) v Drillsafe Ltd [2001] RPC 7 at 141 142. Thus, the words used in a specification are to be given the meaning that the hypothetical addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: D&eacute;cor at 391; Photocure at [170]. 25 A feature of a claim is considered essential if the hypothetical reader (that is, a reader skilled in the art before the priority date) would have understood from the language used in the claim, in the context of the specification as a whole, that the patentee intended that strict compliance was an essential requirement of the invention: Catnic at 243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Populin at 476; Beltreco at [81]."
discussed,Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 ,"noted above, Comandate Marine's proceedings in rem contained no such request. And, Art 8(1) of the Model Law, relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration, if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute. 59 Russell on Arbitration (22 nd ed) at 610 [A5-018] refers to Art 8(1) having the same effect as English law; i.e. the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings (op cit at 296 [7-005]). The position is similar under s 53(2) of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW) which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court. I am of opinion that Comandate Marine's conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement, and that Art 8(1) and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it. Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood [1910] 1 Ch at 786-787. By pleading the writ in the way which it did, Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 4(3)(f) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) in this Court. I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court, Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage. It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ. The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed (notionally or actually) to the mast of the Boomerang I . Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded, it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). In its report: Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction (Report No 33, 1986) Law Reform Commission (Australia), the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere, if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction. The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied, and hence that a just result would be obtained. It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made, and in achieving co-operation between courts and arbitrators to this end. However, the Commission desired, in the solution it proposed, that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits (ALRC 33 [189]). That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that, as at 1986, English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security, although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum: The Tuyuti [1984] QB 838 at 851; Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 (3) SAf LR 261 at 268, 270 (Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa). Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 at 915-916. There, Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract, which was still executory, involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations, including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches, arising under the executory, and now abandoned, contract. Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, who gave the leading speech (see [1983] 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock) said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact ([1983] 1 AC at 913F). He continued ([1983] 1 AC at 914A-C): 'The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law : see Chitty on Contracts , 23 rd ed. (1968), vol 1, p 577, para 1231, and cases there cited. Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way, there are two ways in which A can put his case. The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party, as evinced to the other party and acted on by him, leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract. The second method is by showing that the conduct of B, as evinced towards A, has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract, even though it has not in fact been B's intention to do so, and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief. The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B. The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting, as against A, that he, B, has not abandoned the contract : Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd [1919] 1 KB 78.' This contractual analysis is inapposite here, but their Lordships' approach shows that, notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit, the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties' obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed. In international trade and commerce, it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with, in particular, the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth). This is because in international trade and commerce, the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested, an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute. The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute. It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45(b) invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century. Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration, including Australia, are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce. However, the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45(b) rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties' chosen method or place of dispute resolution. Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and, indeed, local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains: see e.g.: Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M/V Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 (1995); Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler-Plymouth Inc 473 US 614, 638 (1985); Scherk v Alberto-Culver Co 417 US 506, 516 (1974); Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 343 per Brennan and Dawson JJ, 354 per Toohey J agreeing (cf: Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F.C.R.S. Shipping Ltd (1994) 113 DLR (4 th ) 536 at 541-542 (Federal Court of Appeal). But, just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45(b), so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election. When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized, it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings. It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way, but it did not do so. The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied, and to which Sheppard J referred, did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election. For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable. Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too, the arbitration agreement in cl 45(b) has been, in substance, abandoned or for the purposes of s 7(5) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed. WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING? Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. Pan says that where the contract was formed, as it argues the charter party was in this case, either by acts or conduct, Art II r 2 is not satisfied. Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence. In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS (1995) Year Book Comm. Arb'n XX 739 at 740. The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded, there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram. Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer ((1997) Year Book Comm. Arb'n Vol II, 237 at 238). The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required. A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party's appearance in the arbitration. In this matter, however, the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation, but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far. The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur. I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal, as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. And, In Zambia Steel &amp; Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark &amp; Eaton Ltd [1986] 2 Lloyd's Rep 225 at 234, Ralph Gibson LJ said: 'It is clear to me that the [New York] Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document.' The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg [2003] 2 WWR 621 at 628 [18] that Art IV r 1(b) of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award, to provide '[t]he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof'. They said that '... there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process', in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an 'agreement in writing'. In A.J. van den Berg's The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 (1981) at 196-198, 206, 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded (at 197, 227) that, as at 1981 there had been only one '... exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2', that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam. The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters, and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised. Significantly, he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate. In his article 'Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice ? ' (1996) International Arbitration vol 12, no 1, p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg's interpretation. Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders, the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention, who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate's consideration of Prof Sanders' proposal to add to the draft of Art II r 2 the following words: 'Confirmation in writing by one of the parties (which is kept) without contestation by the party.' (UN DOC E/CONF. 26L.54) The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected (van den Berg: op cit at 196; Kaplan: op cit 32-33). Earlier, as Kaplan J, he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited [1994] 2 HKC 526 (HCMP000 908/1994) that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law (see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth)). Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant, in writing, assented to the agreement to arbitrate (see at [12]). It has been recognized that a national courts, in the interest of uniformity, should construe rules formulated by an international convention, especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods, in a normal manner, appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention, unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law, or by English or domestic legal precedent, but on broad principles of general acceptation: Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd [1980] HCA 51 ; (1980) 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce's speech in James Buchanan &amp; Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping (UK) Ltd [1978] AC 141 at 152 and see too: Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M/V Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 537 (1995) per Kennedy J (Renquist CJ, Scalia, Souter, Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing). Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say (147 CLR at 159): 'It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application.' (see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad [1998] HCA 65 ; (1988) 196 CLR 161 at 186 [71] per McHugh J) It is also important in construing international conventions, that the views taken by courts, particularly the Supreme Courts of nations, are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation. And, I am conscious that in s 3(1) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) the definition of 'arbitration agreement' is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2. As a matter of construction under Australian law, I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one. However, I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. The pre-contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free-standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed. It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter. And as Capt Piperakis said, he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided. The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel, on the evidence before me, unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound. That agreement, which thus brought cl 45(b) into existence as an agreement to arbitrate, was manifested by Comandate Marine's conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel. At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party, including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication, even though both parties have not executed it: The Epsilon Rosa [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep 509 at 514 [21] per Tuckey LJ (May and Brooke LJJ agreeing). But as Tuckey LJ pointed out ([2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 515 [29]) one cannot generalize in these cases. The act of acceptance, which formed the contract, was the provision of the bank guarantee. And, it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine. Both parties were under a duty to co-operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing ( Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68 at 70-71 per Griffith CJ). No doubt cl 45(b) was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine. But that does not, of itself, comply with Art II r 2. Rather, the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence. So, the contract (being or including the arbitration agreement) was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails. The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2. And, because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of 'letters or telegrams' including telexes or emails, then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2. A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer: Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited (1988) 14 NSWLR 523 at 534-535 per McHugh JA (Samuels JA agreeing at 531). Accordingly, I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed 'FINAL RECAP' was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee. For the reasons I have given, based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient, on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no 'agreement in writing' for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention. COMANDATE MARINE'S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 (NSW) Comandate Marine argued, that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 7(2) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) were not found, I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW). The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW) provides that an arbitration agreement '... means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration' (see s 4(1)). By s 53(1) the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration. Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem, as I have found, without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings, I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration. However, its application for stay is made in Pan's proceedings. At the time when Pan's proceedings were commenced, Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now. I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant. By s 53(2) , the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance. Although Comandate Marine's proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings, they form, as I have held, part of the same 'matter' for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution , and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found. SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A , 52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87 , including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were 'colourable'. It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court. Rather, it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) were, in essence, the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan. Comandate Marine, in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction. I do not think this argument has any substance. Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), in which s 52 is found, sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce. The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 80 ALJR 183 at 191 [29] per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 83 [97] . In the latter case, the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 205 (see 202 CLR at 83 [97]), in the following terms: 'Likewise, the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing-off. If, as I consider, the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law, it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law. The statute provides an additional remedy .' (emphasis added) I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction. The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) under the trade and commerce power in s 51(i) of the Constitution . There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court's jurisdiction. Pan's pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell (cf: D'Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 755 at 761 [32] ). The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13. But, on examination, s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court, including this Court, has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) itself. Rather, s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76(ii) or (iii) of the Constitution . In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise, s 13 thus provides some guidance. It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76(ii) and (iii) of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court. Section 76(iii) ('of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction') is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12 . And s 76(ii) provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter 'arising under any laws made by the Parliament'. The purpose of s 13 is to limit, in the construction of the Act, the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth. It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction. Clearly enough, s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words: Owners of ""Shin Kobe Maru"" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421; see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia [2006] HCA 38 at [7] - [10] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Crennan JJ. Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked, the Court should exercise it ( Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511 at 588 [149] ), even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse: cf: Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority [2006] HCA 27 [3]-[15] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ: see too: Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship 'Global Peace' [2006] FCA 954 at [138] per Allsop J, see too at [62]-[76]. Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) by s 31. But s 31(1) provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person (defined by s 3(1) as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person) who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property. The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it. Next, Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act. Here, part of the 'matter', within the meaning of ss 76(ii) and (iii) of the Constitution , is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which Pan has pleaded. The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such 'matters'. Here, the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently, one of the other, confers jurisdiction on this Court. Accordingly, I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this. That is not to say, however, that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available, necessarily, to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person, such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12 . I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction. Rather, appositely to the present proceedings, there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act. Pan's claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim: s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The Court, at the final hearing, can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters, including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims. Indeed, one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract, not pursuant to contractual principles, but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act: Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 at 409 [52] . And, the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) are designed to give effect, in cases of contravention of s 52 , to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 83 [97] ; Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 80 ALJR 183. International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels, is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution (s 51(i)). And, par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia (see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 at 568 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 547A-548D per Beaumont, Drummond and Sundberg JJ). Next, Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The 'Kiukiang Career' ( Hi-Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No 5) (1998) 90 FCR 1). In that case the relevant clause provided that 'any dispute arising from this charter' would be settled in a London arbitration. Obviously, it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made. Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment (with whom Branson J expressly agreed) considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause (cl 45(b)): viz: 'arising out of'. Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement (90 FCR at 21G). But, he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question (90 FCR at 22A-B) and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party (90 FCR at 22B-C). In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd (1996) 39 NSWLR 160 Gleeson CJ (Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing) held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement, notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked, so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause. Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement, the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre-contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) does not bring a statutory claim within the expression 'arising out of this contract'. Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40 -636 on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement. In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales, the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement, as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention (39 NSWLR at 166F-G). As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 344 (with whom Toohey J agreed at p 354) in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes 'arising out of' or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof (169 CLR at 337) '... the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between [the parties] or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause: Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40-636 at 47,173'. In Union of India v EB Abby's Rederi AS ('The Evje') [1975] AC 797 Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, reasoned that a dispute was one 'arising out of' a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York/Antwerp Rules 1950 and to be settled in London. He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation ([1975] AC 807H-808B, 808G, Lord Reid at 804E, and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at 816C). Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect ([1975] AC at 816F-8). In Ethiopian Oil Seed &amp; Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc [1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 86 at 97, Hirst J took the view that the words 'arising out of' covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all. He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties' presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings. And, in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation [2004] FCA 698 ; (2004) 138 FCR 496 at 503-504 [32] - [37] Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses, where the fair reading of them is not confined, was to give width, flexibility and amplitude to them (see [2004] FCA 698 ; 138 FCR 496 at 504 [36] ). Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons (Rochdale) Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 439. There, French J said of a clause providing for disputes 'arising under this agreement' that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement: '... can be said to arise out of the agreement. They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance. No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement.' (43 FCR at 448) In my opinion French J's reasoning, although directed to a different form of words, is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims. In the The 'Playa Laga' [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 171 at 183, Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words 'all disputes arising out of this contract' are less precise than they looked. They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd [1916] 1 AC 314 at 328. The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution, first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause. Their Lordships, obiter, observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts, that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other, the dispute falls within the arbitration clause ([1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 183). And, in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40 -636 at 47,173-47,174 Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract. He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source. And, conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established, if at all, irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties. Beaumont J said: 'In short, an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is not, as a matter of characterization, a ""controversy or claim arising out of or relating to (the) Agreement"" for the purposes of ... that contract.' I agree with Beaumont J's analysis. However, in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd [2005] FCA 1102 at [56] Allsop J suggested that the phrase 'arising out of' in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical, rather than theoretical, meaning to be given to the word 'contract' out of which disputes may arise. He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation, extent and scope. Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The 'Kuikang Career' (1998) 90 FCR 1 (see [2005] FCA 1102 [68]). I am of opinion that the Full Court's construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event, like Allsop J, I am bound by it. Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 222 ALR 202 indicated that The 'Kiukiang Career' 90 FCR 1 was no longer good law and it should not be followed. I do not accept that argument. The construction of the operation of ss 82 and 86 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 222 ALR 202 was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression 'arising by reason of a contract'. Thus Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were, for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), claims 'arising by reason of a contract' (222 ALR at 219 [71]). The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose 'by reason of the contract', because if the thing complained of, namely the entry into the contract, had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s 82(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). Here, the claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) however, did not 'arise out of the contract', because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim. Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence, although elements of the performance of the contract, or non performance of the contract will have become relevant. Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti-anti-suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) amounted 'to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract'. The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament, is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law. If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention. ESTOPPEL Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention. I do not understand how that could be. The facts are objective. The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later (cf Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353 at 360). No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind. There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter. I see no substance in the argument. ANTI-ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTION Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate. I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court's jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country. I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment ( Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' [2006] FCA 881). However, Comandate Marine, by its counsel, offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s 7(2) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims, to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and/or entry into of the charter and/or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl 45(b) and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration. Comandate Marine, by its counsel, also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction, and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties. Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Comandate's undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators. There is no power in s 7(2) to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate. The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause ( Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 344). While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum, they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party. Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings, if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London, it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on 22 June 2006 the injunction must be continued. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia. The Master and crew, when not at sea, might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere. The vessel's classification society representatives were in Greece, Singapore and Sri Lanka. The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December 2005 and there were also the ship's agent and surveyor located there. The owners' and charterers' Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June 2006. Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London. It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors. It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in 2005, the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year. There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis' evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute. I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct, although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on 22 June 2006. While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel's condition, it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned. Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing. The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship's company. Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least 12 different witnesses, 10 from the Authority, who may be required to give evidence. Of course, certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore, on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship's company will be from Australia. There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl 45(b) that the seat of the arbitration be there. CONCLUSION I order that Comandate Marine's motion be dismissed with costs. It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on 13 July 2006 until further order will continue undisturbed. I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-five (125) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

distinguished,Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth and Another [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97,"As Black CJ and Moore J said in Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth and Another [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97 (' Save the Ridge '), 105 at [19]: 'The apparent purpose of s 524 is to take the process of authorisation by governments or government agencies outside the purview of the EPBC Act by excluding certain decisions by those bodies from the concept of relevant ""action"".' 49 Forestry Tasmania is an agency of the State of Tasmania. It submits that as such it has granted to Gunns Limited ('Gunns') a 'governmental authorisation' under s 524(2) to conduct forestry operations in coupes 17E and 19D. It relies on Save the Ridge where a Full Court of this Court held that Ministerial approval and gazettal of changes to the National Capital Plan of the Australian Capital Territory, necessary to permit the construction of a road, was a decision of a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation to the Australian Capital Territory. Forestry Tasmania contends that an authorisation, when issued by a government body, will be a 'governmental authorisation when issued by the governmental body in its capacity as such' under s 524(2) of the EPBC Act. 50 Forestry Tasmania says the Forest Practices Plans for coupes 17E and 19D constitute the formal documents by which it authorised Gunns to conduct forestry operations. It submits that on this ground alone the application before the Court must fail. 51 The applicant contends that the submission of Forestry Tasmania referred to above depends on a characterisation of Forestry Tasmania's actions ('that is, logging, roading and the like') not as the physical activities involved, but as a product of a process where it authorises such activities to occur. 53 On this aspect of the proceeding, I prefer the applicant's submission. Save the Ridge is distinguishable because the attack in that case was on the steps taken to amend a plan which would authorise the construction of a freeway extension. There was no attack on the construction of the freeway extension. Here, there is no attack on a Forest Practices Plan, but on the work which is planned to take place under a Forest Practices Plan."
distinguished,In re Dagnall Ex parte Soan &amp; Morley [1896] 2 QB 407 ,"The applicant relies upon a line of cases in bankruptcy commencing with In re Dagnall Ex parte Soan &amp; Morley [1896] 2 QB 407. Pursuant to the Married Women's Property Act 1982 , 'Every married woman carrying on a trade separately from her husband shall, in respect of her separate property, be subject to the bankruptcy laws in the same way as if she were a feme sole.' Mrs Dagnall had been carrying on a trade separately from her husband. Having sold her business, she gave notice to creditors that she was about to suspend payment of their debts. As a result a bankruptcy petition was presented. The question was whether or not the bankruptcy laws continued to apply to her after she had ceased trading but whilst she still owed trading debts. The Divisional Court (Vaughan Williams J and Wright J) found that the bankruptcy legislation continued to apply. Vaughan Williams J said (at 410-11): 'But whether a person is carrying on a trade or not is a question of fact; and if it were not for the decision in Ex parte McGeorge... , I would have said without any hesitation that as long as a woman trading separately from her husband had not paid the trade debts which she had incurred, so long she was continuing to trade. It seems to me that trading is not completed until you have performed all the obligations that the fact of trading imposed upon you. And that was the view that was taken in the older cases. Then we have to consider whether there is anything in the decision in Ex parte McGeorge... which prevents us from holding that the non-payment of debts incurred by a married woman while trading separately is evidence that she is still continuing to trade.' 24 His Lordship then referred to numerous ""older"" cases, noting that the decision in Ex parte McGeorge had departed from them on the basis of differences in the wording of the relevant bankruptcy legislation. Two alternative lines of reasoning emerge from his Lordship's brief judgment. The first is that a trader continues to trade until he or she has performed all obligations incurred as a result of such trading. The second is that non-payment of trading debts is evidence of continued trading, presumably to be considered in the light of other evidence. Wright J disposed of the matter on a different basis, holding (at 411) that: '... this appeal must be allowed, upon the short ground that in my view the natural meaning of the section is that a married woman who trades separately is to be subject to the bankruptcy laws in respect of all debts incurred by her in the period during which she was carrying on the trade.' 26 Those ""older cases"" are of some assistance in understanding the decision in Dagnall . In Meggot v Mills , 1 Ld Raym 286; 91 ER 1088, it was said that: '... though a man quits his trade, yet he may be a bankrupt for the debts that he owed before.' 29 In bankruptcy matters, Dagnall has been followed in Theophile v The Solicitor-General [1950] AC 186 at 201-203; In re Bird v Inland Revenue Commissioner [1962] 1 WLR 686 at 695-697 and In re a Debtor [1992] Ch 554. However, in Avondale Motors (Parts) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1971] HCA 17 ; (1971) 124 CLR 97 at 102-103, Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) doubted the applicability of the decision in Dagnall 'beyond the field of bankruptcy and into that of taxation law' , referring to the decision of Tryka Ltd v Newall (1963) 41 TC 146 where Wilberforce J (as his Lordship then was) said: 'I do not think I can accept the application of the bankruptcy cases here. It seems to me that the two fields are quite different. When one is considering the question whether for purposes of bankruptcy laws a person is carrying on business, it may be necessary to hold that he does not cease to carry on business when trading activity has ceased, and for that reason, the Courts have been ready to extend the Section so as to cover a case where he has left debts unpaid. But to apply the same line of thought to Income Tax cases would lead to very great difficulties and, indeed, would mean that almost every case which one finds in the books on such questions as cessation of business would have been complicated by the introduction of this question and might, indeed, have been otherwise decided.' 38 One might well say that the railway company was in a position similar to that of the applicant prior to 25 June 2001. It had an interest in an asset, which was being managed by another party, and derived income from such interest. However the change in the undertaking of the railway company effected by the 1906 agreement was quite different from that made to the applicant's position by the agreement of 25 June 2001. The railway company's capital continued to be tied up in the railway, and it continued to derive income from that source. In the present case the applicant terminated its investment in the joint venture and ceased to derive income from it. Although Lord Sumner's reference to Dagnall may suggest some support for the applicant's case, the reference hardly amounted to an endorsement of the decision, and his Lordship clearly decided the case on its own facts. The other Law Lords made no reference to Dagnall . The applicant also refers to decisions applying the Dagnall-Theophile line of authorities in the Australian Taxation Board of Review and in Canada where Bowman CJ said: 'It is, I believe, settled law that a business continues to be carried on so long as the obligations arising out of the business remain unfulfilled ... .' 39 The cases cited in Dagnall and the reasons of Wright J do not support that proposition, even in the bankruptcy context. The rule is rather that, under bankruptcy legislation then in force, trading debts were recoverable in bankruptcy after trading had ceased. In Australia two eminent judges have doubted the wisdom of applying that proposition in the tax context, and a third (Brennan J) appears to have had a similar view. In England another eminent judge has expressed similar reservations. The decision in South Behar Railway cannot be interpreted as an endorsement of the wider application of the decision in Dagnall . Only one member of the House of Lords referred to it, and in a qualified way. Decisions in the Australian Taxation Board of Review can hardly be set against the views of the judges to whom I have referred. The observation in the Canadian case is not persuasive. In the circumstances I decline to follow Dagnall for present purposes."

discussed,"Tisand Pty Limited v The Owners of the Ship MV ""Cape Moreton"" (Ex Freya) [2005] FCAFC 68 ; (2005) 143 FCR 43","Tisand Pty Limited v The Owners of the Ship MV ""Cape Moreton"" (Ex Freya) [2005] FCAFC 68 ; (2005) 143 FCR 43 Ryan and Allsop JJ, particularly at 68-74 [100]-[122] engaged in a substantial and learned discussion of the importance of identifying persons with a proprietary interest as owner or demise charterer in arrest proceedings, albeit that they concentrated on the question of ownership. They said that in ss 17 , 18 and 19 of the Act, the phrase ""the owner"" was used in a proprietary sense, reflecting the clear purpose of the Act to require that the property proposed to be arrested belong to the relevant person: The ""Cape Moreton"" 143 FCR at 73 [118]. Here, that approach must be adapted to the special provisions of s 18 in relation to a demise charterer being the relevant person. At the time of the arrest of the ""APC Aussie 1"" , T-D was the relevant person, as the existing demise charterer. T-D was the contracting party with EMAS under the charter for her towage. But, at the present time T-D is not capable of being a relevant person in respect of the barge because the demise charter has been terminated and APC Marine, as owner, has retaken possession. T-D now has no proprietary interest in the barge, yet EMAS is seeking to extend the ambit of the security for which the arrest was obtained to a cause of action not previously contemplated in either the writ or the amended writ. If granted, the amendment would have the effect of greatly expanding the amount of security that EMAS could require for release of the "" APC Aussie 1 "" before its owner would be able to exercise its proprietary rights, even though the new claim involves no direct relationship between EMAS and APC Marine. There may be occasions (that were not suggested during the hearing) in which it is possible to argue that such an amendment could be appropriate. It is for that reason that I do not wish to express a final view on this question and instead have exercised my discretion to refuse the application to amend. The reality is that EMAS seeks to utilise the earlier arrest of the barge, to bring pressure on APC Marine well after EMAS became aware of the existence of APC Marine's Singaporean writ and in circumstances in which EMAS has delayed making the application to amend until after the intervening event of APC Marine's termination of its charterparty with T-D."

The juridical notion of 'privies', or more perhaps precisely, privity in interest, was examined in Effem at first instance by Gummow J ( Trawl Industries of Australia Pty Limited (in liquidation) v Effem Foods Pty Limited (1992) 36 FCR 406). At 413-414, his Honour made the threshold observation that ' ... the doctrine of privity in interest... operates in the same way upon the doctrines of cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel... [t]he basic requirement of a privy in interest [being] that the privy must claim ""under or through"" the person to whom he is said to be a privy... [t[he necessary identity in interest may arise from a successive relationship in a temporal sense..., when finding the necessary privity, in a succussive or mutual relationship, the courts have looked to legal rather than economic indicia as the criterion of operation of the privity doctrine '. One example to which his Honour referred (at 414) was of holders of successive interests in the same fund, notwithstanding that they had become members of the fund subsequent to dismissal of proceedings brought by other beneficiaries. His Honour found that the applicant for relief in Effem ' ... was not claiming under or in virtue of any legal right of the other applicants in the present proceedings '. The taxpayer applicants' contended that there was an absence of satisfaction in the circumstances of this case of the requirement of privity of interest in relation to the respective claims of IEF and QTH on the one hand and that of Spassked on the other, implicitly notwithstanding that each was a wholly owned subsidiary of IEL, and moreover traced their ultimate corporate membership to the Adsteam Group. In any event, the taxpayer applicants contended in written submissions in reply as 'not disputed' that '[i]f Spassked and IEL are not estopped from pursuing appeals in other years that their privies cannot be estopped', but whether the converse of that proposition is true may be another matter, depending upon the scope of the doctrinal notions of privy and privity of interest."

It is enough that the findings and reasons deal with the substantial issues upon which the decision turned and that they do so in a way which clearly exposes the reasoning process: Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 at 567-568; Hawkins v Comcare [2001] FCA 726 ; (2001) 115 FCR 127 at [60] .
applied,Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427,"to the first limb, it is to be noted that s 52(4) and (5) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) provide as follows: (4) A creditor's petition lapses at the expiration of: (a) subject to paragraph (b), the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of the petition; or (b) if the Court makes an order under subsection (5) in relation to the petition &#8212; the period fixed by the order; unless, before the expiration of whichever of those periods is applicable, a sequestration order is made on the petition or the petition is dismissed or withdrawn. (5) The Court may, at any time before the expiration of the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of a creditor's petition, if it considers it just and equitable to do so, upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, order that the period at the expiration of which the petition will lapse be such period, being a period exceeding 12 months and not exceeding 24 months, commencing on the date of presentation of the petition as is specified in the order. Order 35 r 7(3) of the Federal Court Rules provides as follows: A clerical mistake in a judgment or order, or an error arising in a judgment order from an accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the Court. Rule 1.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth), it may be noted, provides that the Federal Magistrates Court may apply the Federal Court Rules where, in a particular case, the 2001 Rules are "" insufficient or inappropriate "". By reason of the terms of Rule 1.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules , no question arises as to a Federal Magistrate not being clothed with authority to invoke O 35 r 7: Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 at [37] to [41] [2008] FCA 427 ; , 246 ALR 175 at 181 to 182 per Lindgren J. Section 52(5), it has been observed, is in some ways comparable to the statutory requirement that a company be wound up within six months of an application being made. And in Elyard Corporation Pty Ltd v DDB Needham Sydney Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 385 consideration was given to whether that statutory requirement displaced the "" slip rule "". That decision has since been applied in the context of bankruptcy proceedings in Griffiths v Boral Resources (Qld) Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 149 , 154 FCR 554. Spender ACJ, Dowsett and Collier JJ there observed as follows: [29] The decision of the Full Court in Re Young; ex parte Smith (1985) 5 FCR 204 establishes that there can be no extension pursuant to s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act once the petition has lapsed. However the Court (of which Lockhart J was a member) considered that there was no question of applying the slip rule in that case (at 209). In Elyard the Court addressed the slip rule, but in the context of winding up rather than bankruptcy. Although s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act serves substantially the same purpose as s 459R of the Corporations Act , there are potentially significant differences between the two sections. [30] With all respect, we are a little uncomfortable with the view, inherent in Elyard , that the slip rule may be used to extend time notwithstanding the statutory requirement that such order be made within a period of time which has elapsed. However Elyard concerns the practice of the Court and has now stood for over ten years without legislative intervention. We are reluctant to reconsider it. Although it does not directly bind us in applying s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act , to take a different approach would cause substantial confusion in insolvency practice. [31] We wish to stress, however, the importance of the policy, evidenced in both the Corporations Act and the Bankruptcy Act , that insolvency proceedings be speedily resolved, presumably for commercial reasons and for reasons of fairness. Courts exercising jurisdiction in insolvency must recognise this policy by giving priority to the hearing and determination of such matters. The parties and their legal advisers, particularly those advising petitioning creditors, must be aware of the potential problem. The decision in Elyard should not be taken as establishing an unlimited power to avoid this statutory policy. As also noted by their Honours, the question as to whether there was any "" error "" which attracted the power to invoke the "" slip rule "" is a question of fact: [2006] FCAFC 149 at [68] . With respect, the same reservation is also expressed as to ability to correct an "" error "" pursuant to O 35 r 7 by extending the duration of a petition in the face of the express statutory terms of s 52(5). Notwithstanding that reservation, it is the case that other authorities have endorsed the existence of a power to extend time after the initial 12 month period has expired and where there has been an accidental slip or omission in failing to make an application within the time prescribed by s 52(5): Matthews v Collett [2000] FCA 224 ; Bankstown Grammar School Ltd v Park [2000] FCA 1205 ; Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 , 246 ALR 175 ; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 , 171 FCR 462."

cited,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"I should indicate that even if I came to the conclusion that there was a failure to adhere to a requirement of consultation with a local Aboriginal community prior to suspension or removal, I would not consider that such failure would vitiate the decision to remove or suspend. I readily accept that the Act has given express and considerable prominence to the role of the local Aboriginal communities, and that the Act envisages that consultation with such communities be undertaken in defined circumstances. However, I must look at the power here being exercised, which is not one of appointment, but of suspension and removal. Such powers may need to be exercised in a variety of circumstances, without there necessarily being any relevance in seeking the views of local Aboriginal communities, such as for instance if a particular inspector was considered no longer to be a fit and proper person. I do not accept that the input of the local Aboriginal community is of the same significance in circumstances of suspension or removal, or that consultation would be regarded as an essential or mandatory requirement to effect a suspension or removal. If necessary to decide, I would take the view that if there was a requirement of consultation with a local Aboriginal community prior to suspension or removal, breach of that requirement would not lead to the invalidity of such a suspension or removal: see generally Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-391; and Bond v WorkCover Corporation (SA) (2005) 93 SASR 315 at 331-336."
followed,Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323,"Consistent with the legislative objective sought to be achieved by s 40(1)(g) , it has been held that the phrase "" could not have been set up "" refers to a "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" which could not have been set up as a matter of law; a mere failure to take advantage of an opportunity to do so does not fall within s 40(1)(g): Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323. Fisher J there usefully summarised as follows some of the relevant authorities (at 326): The relevant words of the Act were considered by Lockhart J in Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd. (1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... . Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'"" In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p 730 Avory J said: ""I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action. ""I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."" The judgment debtor was there asserting that, despite his best endeavours, he could not obtain "" factual and expert evidence "" to establish his counterclaim. That was not sufficient to bring himself within s 40(1)(g). Fisher J concluded (at 326): In my opinion these statements of principle... determine the matter against the debtor. There was no reason in law why he could not set up his counterclaim in the creditor's proceedings. ...

considered,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561,"In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at 574 ("" Pegasus ""), Davies AJ addressed the question whether the sole director of the company which promoted and operated a managed investment scheme should also be considered to be a person operating the scheme. His Honour said at [55]-[57]: ""The word 'operate' is an ordinary word of the English language and, in the context, should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance. The term is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme. The Oxford English Dictionary gives these relevant meanings: 5. To effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work. 6. To cause or actuate the working of; to work (a machine, etc). Chiefly U.S. 7. To direct the working of; to manage, conduct, work (a railway, business, etc); to carry out or through, direct to an end (a principle, an undertaking, etc) orig. U.S. I have concluded that Mr McKim operated the managed investment scheme. He was the living person who formulated and directed the scheme and he was actively involved in its day to day operations. He supervised others in their performance. I have also concluded that Mr McKim is not exempted by s601ED(6). He did not 'merely' act as agent or employee of Pegasus. He was the directing mind and will of Pegasus and of the scheme."" 35 Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488. In that case, the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme. His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme, and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme. Accordingly, he was operating the scheme in contravention of s 601EB(5). In making these findings, Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred. 55 Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW ) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121, esp at 125, the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: see Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 at 603; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; and Pegasus at 571. ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act , and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects. The making of such a declaration does not simply record the outcome of enforcement proceedings; it may also be an appropriate way of marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 80 at 97-99, 106 and 110. 77 ASIC does not seek an order that BTS be wound up, even though there is some evidence that it might be insolvent. In many cases, it may be appropriate, and it may further investor protection, to make winding up orders in respect of both the unregistered managed investment scheme and the company which administered the scheme: see Pegasus at 579-580, at [95] [98]. Indeed, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778 at 796, Owen J said at [93] that if an unregistered scheme is to be wound up, the case for a liquidation of the company that conducted it is compelling."

followed,Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599,"J has on two occasions expressed a different view: see Clinique Laboratories v Luxury Skincare Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; (2003) 61 IPR 130 at [132] and Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [6] - [26] ( Pfizer ). His Honour considered the higher Lomas standard in some detail in Pfizer . After an exhaustive review of the authorities, and noting that the observations in Lomas itself were ""plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument"", his Honour stated at [21]: The fundamental difficulty with [the respondent's] argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s 55. Whether a ground of opposition has been ""established"" is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation. In my opinion, there is no basis upon which the section can be read as ""the extent (if any) to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established"", particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof. It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all. The precise finding in that case was that the opposition ""should be upheld only if the court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered"": at [22]. With all respect, that test is not to be found in the statute. I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the 1995 Act that would point to reading s 55 other than according to its ordinary meaning. Guylian did not seek to justify in a substantive way the approach of the Full Court in Lomas . It sought to rely on the decision, and those that have followed it, but it acknowledged that other decisions run counter to it. In my view, there is nothing in the relevant provisions that supports the imposition of a higher standard, even at the acceptance stage. The ""presumption of registrability"" arises from s 33 of the Act: Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 at [24] ; Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 at [50] . Section 33 does not speak of being ""clearly satisfied""; it mandates acceptance of an application unless the Registrar "" is satisfied that ... there are grounds for rejecting it"". On this point, I prefer the views expressed by Gyles J and in particular his Honour's observations that an acceptance that there is a presumption of registrability ""says nothing as to the standard of proof"" and does not import a higher threshold than the conventional balance of probabilities: see Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [18] . The presumption as it is gives effect to the general position under the Act that an applicant is not required to establish an absence of grounds to refuse or object to registration. It should also be noted that in both Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 and Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 (both acceptance stage cases) there is no suggestion that any special higher standard was applicable."
considered,Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347,"J, when dealing with a case involving the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 (Cth) in Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347, decided that the Federal Court could consider as a 'justiciable matter' an allegation by the Deputy Commissioner that false statements had been made by the Australian government to the German government. The issue of the relationship between the governments was raised in the course of the Court's exercising jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act . In that case, his Honour embarked on the issue and had regard to diplomatic notes (' notes verbales ') exchanged between the two governments. After reviewing the authorities relating to justiciability, his Honour observed at 369 that in Australia, one looks not to the traditionally recognised content of the prerogative power, as in Britain, but rather to s 61 of the Constitution , which vests the executive power of the Commonwealth in the Crown. He noted that the executive power extends to the execution and maintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth, thus enabling the Crown to undertake all executive action appropriate to areas of responsibility vested in the Commonwealth. One of these areas is the conduct of international relations and the acquisition of international rights and obligations. Accordingly, the Court can adjudicate on matters going to restraints on and the extent and nature of the executive power as a constitutional question. In such a case, no problem of non-justiciability will arise. His Honour continues at 369 by pointing out that questions as to the character and extent of the powers of the executive government in relation to the conduct of international relations may give rise to a matter which involves the interpretation of s 61 of the Constitution , and consequently will affect the interests of a plaintiff so as to afford him or her standing. Where this is so, there is subject matter for the exercise of federal jurisdiction and no question of non-justiciability will ordinarily arise. His Honour observed that dealings between the governments of Australia and foreign states will not normally, in the absence of legislation, create rights for or impose obligations on Australian citizens, and that a breach of Australia's international obligations, of itself, would not be a matter justiciable at the suit of a private citizen. It is to be noted that these observations are carefully worded so as to not foreclose argument in exceptional circumstances. His Honour said at 370: '... there will be no ""matter"" [on which the Court can adjudicate] if the plaintiff seeks an extension of the Court's true function into a domain that does not belong to it, namely the consideration of undertakings and obligations depending entirely on political sanctions.' He refers, by way of an example of such political questions, to agreements and understandings between Australian and foreign governments. Mr Hicks refers to these principles and submits that s 61 of the Constitution confers power on the executive to protect citizens overseas. He submits that the adjudication of the legality of actions of the executive is amenable to the Chapter III courts and the fact that those powers are exercised in relation to some aspect of foreign affairs or diplomatic negotiations does not automatically exclude the conduct of the Government from review by Chapter III courts. The question for a Chapter III court is whether the proceeding requires the extension of the court's jurisdiction into areas political in nature such that it has no legal guidelines or criteria against which to make its determination. Rather than exclude certain areas such as foreign relations totally from judicial review, Mr Hicks submits that the proper approach is to carefully examine the particular grounds of review raised on which the specific relief is based. In the present case, the applicant submits in relation to the ground of judicial review that extraneous or irrelevant considerations have influenced the decision of the Executive not to request the return of Mr Hicks to Australia. As a consequence, that decision should be set aside and the Executive ordered to consider the question in accordance with law."
cited,Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 (2003) 131 FCR 28,"There are perhaps greater difficulties in relation to the questions of bias and discrimination. There is little doubt that a denial of procedural fairness can amount to an error of law on the part of the Tribunal, and that the Court can receive evidence and make findings of fact in relation to such a denial. See Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 (2003) 131 FCR 28 at [3] - [13] per Gray ACJ and North J. There is also little doubt that the Tribunal is bound by the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (""the Racial Discrimination Act "") and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth). Under the latter, of course, before a proceeding is taken in Court in respect of a complaint of discrimination, including a complaint of discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act , it is necessary to make that complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and to have the certificate of the Commission before the proceeding can be commenced in the Court. To the extent, therefore, that the applicant seeks to rely on those Acts, there is nothing to show that the proceeding is properly within the jurisdiction of this Court. 14 The orders that the applicant seeks in the notice of appeal, with the exception of the awarding of costs to the applicant for the proceeding in this Court if he should succeed, are manifestly orders that the Court could not make. The question whether the Social Security Appeals Tribunal decision should be set aside is a question entirely for the Tribunal and would not activate this Court's jurisdiction at all. For the Court to order that the Tribunal set aside the earlier decision would be for the Court itself to engage in merits review in a proceeding which can only be on a question of law. An order that the Tribunal apologise for racial discrimination would also be beyond the power of the Court, at least without a complaint having been lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as a preliminary to the proceeding in this Court. An order that the Tribunal award costs of the proceeding in the Tribunal to the applicant is likewise beyond the power of the Court. 15 The end result, it seems to me, is that if the applicant wishes to raise any question of bias on the part of the Tribunal, his obligation is to await the conclusion of the proceeding in the Tribunal. If he were to be successful in that proceeding, of course, he would have no right of appeal on the question of bias, and would be bound in any event to fail. If he were to fail in that proceeding, it would then be open to him to pursue, by way of appeal to this Court, any question of bias on the part of the Tribunal. In my view, I am bound by the authorities that say that, with limited exceptions, a decision for the purposes of s 44(1) of the AAT Act is only a final decision."
applied,Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd (1997) 138 FLR 417,"It is now well settled that, if a s 459G application and affidavit are not filed and served within the time so specified, the Court has no power to extend the period for the making of such an application: see Aussie Vic Plant Hire at [3]; David Grant &amp; Co Pty Limited (rec apptd) v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 265. In the present matter, the statutory demand was served on Dromana on 29 November 2007. The application to set it aside was filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 20 December 2007. It was not served on Mr Gryst until 21 December 2007. In consequence, that application was not one made ""in accordance with section 459G"" of the Act. The emphatic language of s 459G(3) admits of no other conclusion: see Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd (1997) 138 FLR 417; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Tixana Pty Ltd (2003) 202 ALR 401 ; Hardel Property Holdings Pty Ltd v Allmark Property Management Pty Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 122 at [1]. While counsel for the plaintiff has sought to avoid this conclusion by recourse to ""purposive legislation"", the Parliament, in my view, has spoken on this matter with unmistakeable clarity. 13 The date the s 459P winding up application was made was 10 June 2008. For the purposes of s 459C(2)(a) the presumption of insolvency could only arise if in the period three months prior to that date, i.e. on or after 10 March 2008, Dromana failed to comply with a statutory demand. Dromana did not fail to comply with the statutory demand during that period. In consequence, Mr Gryst cannot rely on the presumption of insolvency in prosecuting his winding up application as s 459C(2)(a) has not been enlivened in the circumstances: see Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Tixana Pty Ltd with which decisions I respectfully agree."
cited,Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507,"I will enumerate the propositions as follows:- (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 ("" Thompson "") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 ("" Grundt "") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an ""unjust"" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the ""narrower"" and ""broader"" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or ""real detriment"" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 ("" Con-Stan "") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- ""In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise."" (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 ("" Humphreys ""). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 ("" Mobil Oil "") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that ""a particular legal relationship"" or ""interest"" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- ""If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation."" (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 ("" Plimmer"") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 ("" Austotel "") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA. 672 Here the question is whether there has been an unjust departure by one person, that is to say QR, ""from an assumption adopted by another [ie NRC]"" as the basis for NRC's decision to make the investment decisions to which I have referred: see Thompson at 547. 673 Thus, although as I have said at [62], Messrs Butcher, Moore-Wilton and Stanko and Mrs Yeoh gave evidence in general terms that they relied on Mr Graham, it seems to me to be necessary to look at the evidence of their deliberations to see whether this was consistent with the approach taken by Mr Graham. I do not consider that reliance in general terms can be sufficient in circumstances where the individual directors gave evidence of their own approaches to the matter. 693 It follows that of the four pleaded assumptions, only the second assumption finds any support in the evidence. But the only evidence to support it was that of Mr Graham and his approach was inconsistent with that of the other directors. In my opinion this does not establish that NRC adopted the assumption as the basis for the relevant actions within the principle stated by Dixon J in Thompson . 744 As Dixon J said in Thompson at 547, whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption. 745 Even if the assumptions propounded by PN are capable in their terms of giving rise to an estoppel, the claim fails because QR did nothing to occasion or cause the adoption of the assumption. 746 Mr Graham formed his assumptions based upon his reading of the EA. He did not put forward any positive statement or conduct by Mr O'Rourke or, to the extent that Mr Hamill's conduct is, or may, be relevant, any positive statement or conduct of Mr Hamill. Instead he emphasised that nothing said by either of those persons in the period from 1992 to March 1997 was inconsistent with Mr Graham's understanding of the EA. 865 The claim of lost opportunity to apply political pressure is, to borrow from the words of Starke J in Thompson at 528, at best ""wholly speculative and conjectural"" and affords ""no solid basis"" for concluding that NRC acted to its detriment. 866 The same may be said of the suggestion that NRC lost the opportunity to avail itself of the alternative dispute resolution provisions of cl 7 of the EA. Not only did NRC fail to invoke the clause, but as I have already said, the clause did not provide a mechanism for determination of the form or the terms of the rights to be accorded to NRC. 867 There were three species of operational detriment identified by PN. The first was generalised evidence of the adverse effect on future operating conditions at the AR terminal given, in particular, by Mr Fullerton. The second was said to be the comparison between PN's existing cost of operations and the price to be charged by QR under the Terminal Services Agreement. This proposition was put to QR's CEO, Mr Scheuber, in cross-examination."
cited,Hughes (trading as Crowded Planet) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 319,"After considering the proposed orders, the history of this matter, and the submissions of Counsel I am satisfied that the orders proposed by the parties in relation to the contempt charges are appropriate in the circumstances. My reasons are as follows: 1. I accept the applicant's submissions in relation to withdrawing the charges against the first respondent. I note that the first respondent is in liquidation, and the submission in Court on Monday by Mr Aggs, liquidator of the first respondent, that the first respondent is insolvent. I accept the proposition that, in these circumstances, pursuit of the first respondent, which is a corporate entity, is pointless. There are no funds to satisfy any orders, for example, for a fine or costs. It is therefore appropriate for the Court to grant leave to the applicant to withdraw these charges. 2. I accept the applicant's submissions as to withdrawing the charges against the fifth respondent, in light of his age, his role in the conduct the subject of the applicant's claims, and the concession by the applicant as to the evidence against him. 3. I note that the second, third and fourth respondent have pleaded guilty, which is an issue to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 293). I note also the submission of Mr Atkinson for the second, third and fourth respondents that, in pleading guilty, the respondents have avoided the need for two trials, each of which was estimated to be four to five weeks, and have therefore relieved the resources of both the Court and the applicant (cf NW Foods 71 FCR at 291). 4. In this case, the second, third and fourth respondents have pleaded guilty to a statement of charge alleging deliberate and repeated instances of contempt of the orders of Cooper J. Given the nature of the contempt, a significant penalty is in order. 5. The Courts have generally accepted that a term of imprisonment is appropriate only in the most serious criminal contempt cases: R v Fletcher; Ex parte Kisch [1935] HCA 1 ; (1935) 52 CLR 248 at 257 per Evatt J, Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. In this case the proposal of the parties that the third and fourth respondents be sentenced to six months imprisonment, albeit suspended, is at the high end of the range of penalty for contempt, particularly as it is common ground that the respondents had not previously been found by the Court to have acted in contempt. However, the serious nature of the contempt charges in this case, to which the second, third and fourth respondents have pleaded guilty, in my view warrants the prospect of a period of imprisonment. 6. The Federal Court is empowered to impose a sentence of imprisonment for contempt of court, to be suspended on conditions including as to length of time of the suspension: Hughes (trading as Crowded Planet) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 319 at [56] . In the case before me, the proposal that the sentence of six months be suspended for two years is consistent with other decisions involving similarly serious contempts of court (cf Hughes [2004] FCAFC 319 at [57] ). 7. In my view, however, while the sentence is at the higher range, it is not so high as to be oppressive ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 293, cf Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Matthews (2001) 39 ACSR 110 where the contemnor was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, suspended for two years and the Court similarly found that the sentence was not so high as to be oppressive). 8. I note the parties jointly propose that the period of imprisonment of the third and fourth respondents be suspended. In this context however I note that the applicant in this case is the State regulator in the field of consumer protection. It is appropriate to accord weight to the views of the regulator, in particular as to the deterrent quality both for the respondents and for others who may be disposed to engage in conduct of a similar kind ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 292, Mobil Oil [2004] FCAFC 72 at [79] ). 9. Although the award of costs is at the discretion of the Court, commonly in contempt cases there is a link between the award of indemnity costs and the penalty, where the award of costs is in lieu of a fine: Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 per Moore J at [8]-[12]. In this case the proposed orders do not include a fine to be paid by the second, third and fourth respondents, however they do impose an obligation on these respondents to pay a not insignificant sum in costs to the applicant. 10. I am satisfied that this is not a case where the nature of the proposed penalty is an insufficient deterrent by community standards so as to cause the Court to decline to sanction the proposal. I note the submissions by Mr Atkinson that the suspension of the six month sentence results in the third and fourth respondents being their own ""judge and jury"" for 24 months and that this is well-calculated to ensure their good behaviour. While this remains to be seen in practice, the detailed and clear nature of the proposed orders, the permanent restraints on the conduct of the respondents as articulated in the proposal, the not inconsiderable length of time during which the sentence is suspended and the default period of imprisonment in the event of breach of the orders in my view means that the proposed penalty appropriate in this case."

cited,"SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 , 170 FCR 515","provision, it has repeatedly been acknowledged, "" suffers from a lack of clarity "": SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 , 170 FCR 515. Spender, Edmonds and Tracey JJ there usefully summarised as follows some of the less contentious matters involved in the construction of that provision: [10] In a series of cases decided under s 91R(3) , it has been common ground that the subsection suffers from a lack of clarity. Before turning to the difficulties to which the drafting gives rise, it will be convenient to mention some uncontentious matters relating to the construction of the subsection. First, the subsection is cast in imperative terms: it obliges a decision maker to disregard conduct in Australia by an applicant for a protection visa subject to the proviso in paragraph (b). Secondly, the stipulation that a decision maker must ""disregard"" an applicant's conduct in Australia requires that such conduct not be brought into consideration when determining whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason. Thirdly, although the Explanatory Memorandum and the second reading speech both indicate that s 91R(3) of the Act was introduced to deal with sur place claims, it is not, in terms, so confined. Conduct in Australia which is undertaken in order to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in the applicant's country of origin, would support a sur place claim. Other types of conduct may not. Section 91R(3) obliges decision makers to disregard ""any"" conduct by the applicant in Australia. That requirement is qualified by paragraph (b) which provides scope for an applicant to satisfy the decision maker that he or she has engaged in the relevant conduct ""otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person's claims to be a refugee ..."". Conduct in Australia which attracts adverse attention from a foreign government for Convention related reasons would strengthen a person's claim to be a refugee. So too, however, would conduct in Australia which, in an evidentiary sense, rendered it more likely that an applicant had engaged in conduct in his or her home country which led to persecution in that country. Both types of conduct may be engaged in in Australia. ... Decisions of this Court were the catalyst for the introduction of s 91R(3). Those decisions held that a person could become a refugee as a result of conduct, deliberately pursued in Australia, to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in his or her country of origin: [2008] FCAFC 105 at [24] . Special leave to appeal, it should be noted, has been granted: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJXO [2008] HCATrans 404. It is unnecessary to resolve a third contention advanced by the Minister. This contention was that s 91R(3) is not engaged where an applicant does not seek to rely on conduct in Australia to support a well-founded fear of persecution (cf SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] per Jacobson J; SZLQX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1286 at [21] per Jacobson J) or where evidence of conduct is adduced or called by an applicant ( SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 at [16] and [21] to [23] per Spender, Edmonds and Tracey JJ). The contention was that the present Appellant did not seek to rely upon the 1999 or 2000 conduct and did not adduce evidence of such conduct."
applied,Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK [2009] FCAFC 83,"there is no requirement imposed upon the Tribunal to afford a party any opportunity to comment upon proposed findings that it may make: WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 per French J, as His Honour then was, at [36]. There is no such obligation imposed by the common law: Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 , 47 AAR 314 , applying F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Company AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369 per Diplock LJ. Nor does "" information "" for the purposes of s 424A "" encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations "": SZEEU , supra , at [206]. In SZBYR , supra , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed (citations omitted): [18] ... if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting ""information"" within the meaning of par (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute ""information"". Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that the word ""information"": does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc. If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly ""information"" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant ""information"" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself. See also Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK [2009] FCAFC 83 at [16] per Emmett, Kenny and Jacobson JJ; SZIWL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1260 at [20] to [21] per Siopis J."

considered,Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; [1961] 108 CLR 642,"I note that even if I had considered that the probative value of Mr Frick's expert report was not outweighed by the prejudice to the applicants within the meaning of s 135 , I would have ruled that it be given no weight. The weight to be accorded to an expert opinion depends to a significant degree upon the factual basis for such an opinion (cf for example Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; [1961] 108 CLR 642 at 649, Branson J in Quick 87 FCR 371 at 621, Notaras v Hugh [2003] NSWSC 167 at [20] ). I have already discussed in detail the difficulties associated with the lack of identification of sources, and what appears to be the intertwining of information from those sources with the specialised knowledge of Mr Frick in producing his report. Given the facts that: &#8226; a significant factual basis of Mr Frick's opinions was unidentified persons contacted specifically for the purpose of obtaining information upon which to base his opinions, which sources cannot be tested in any way; and &#8226; importantly, the extent to which Mr Frick's opinions were based on these sources compared with his own specialised knowledge (or, in relation to yield, the DPI publication) was unclear from his report the inevitable result in my view was that the report could be accorded no weight even if admitted."
followed,NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287,"These grounds cannot succeed. The facts of this case are quite close to the facts of three unanimous decisions of Full Courts of this Court. The members of each court were different. The decisions are NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208 (Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ), NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 (French, Emmett and Dowsett JJ) and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 (Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ). In each case the court emphasised the proposition that the task of the Minister, through his delegate, and the Refugee Review Tribunal on appeal, pursuant to s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), is to consider whether they are satisfied that the requirements for the grant of a visa have been satisfied. It will be difficult to achieve the requisite degree of satisfaction if the appellant does not provide sufficient information, such as by not attending a hearing. In the absence of a positive finding of satisfaction, a visa application must be rejected. In NAVX at paragraph [5] the Full Court said this: ""In assessing the adequacy of [the Tribunal's] reasons, it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information. Clearly enough, the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing persecution in China. Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution, it could do little more than offer him an opportunity to elaborate. When he failed to accept that opportunity, the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application."""
followed,Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"The Grounds of Appeal , it is considered, are but an impermissible attempt to review the factual merits of the decision reached by the Tribunal and should be rejected. A court conducting judicial review of an administrative decision must "" beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision "": Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. The "" weight "" to be given to the evidence or particular pieces of information is for the Tribunal to assess: Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 at [197] , [2004] HCA 32 ; 197 CLR 510 at 580. Justice Kirby there observed, in the context of those proceedings: [197] It may be accepted that, as the applicant submitted, much of the Tribunal's statement of reasons focuses upon what the applicant said about her husband's arrest and whether what she had said on that subject was to be believed. But it did this in the context of assessing whether her claims that she had been persecuted in the past should be accepted. The Tribunal's reasoning does not reveal any failure to take account of relevant matters or any taking into account of irrelevant matters. In the end, the criticisms made by the applicant of the Tribunal's reasoning are criticisms of the factual findings it made and are criticisms that fasten upon the weight that the Tribunal attributed to various pieces of information that it had available for consideration. But what weight the Tribunal gave to those various pieces of information was for it to say. The task of making findings of fact, including findings as to credibility, is for the Tribunal alone: Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 552, 559."

Whereas under that Act an applicant had to satisfy the Registrar that there were no grounds to object to registration, the position now is that an application must be registered, unless the Registrar is satisfied that there is a ground for rejecting it: see s 33 and reg 17A.24; see also the discussion by French J in Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 at [15] and [20]-[24]. An applicant is thus said to have the benefit of a ""presumption of registrability"" under the Act. In other words, a mark will be presumed registrable unless the Registrar is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that a ground to reject it exists. In Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 , the Full Court considered an application for registration of a shape mark where the only ground of possible rejection was s 41(2). The applicant adduced no evidence of use of the mark and did not rely on either s 41(5) or (6). As a result the case turned on the sole question whether the mark was inherently adapted to distinguish the applicant's goods under s 41(3). In discussing the nature of appeals against decisions of the Registrar, French J stated at [22]: Since the enactment of the 1995 Act the onus is no longer on the applicant to establish registrability as it was under the 1955 Act: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 at 372 3 ... The application must be accepted unless the court is satisfied that it has not been made in accordance with the Act or that there are grounds for rejecting it. If the matter is in doubt then the application should be accepted. The possibility of refusal after a contested opposition with evidence and closer scrutiny remains open. The acceptance stage is not the time for detailed adversarial examination of the application that might be involved in an opposition: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths at FCR 377 .... Acceptance for registration involves an initial screening process albeit it requires the application of statutory criteria and evaluative judgments by the Registrar and the Registrar's delegates. (Emphasis added.) Later, in addressing whether the mark was inherently adapted to distinguish, his Honour said at [50]: [I]t is necessary to bear in mind that this trade mark is still at the registration stage. It enjoys the benefit of the presumption of registrability mandated by s 33. To the extent that critical criteria upon which registration might be rejected are in doubt, the application should be accepted. Closer adversarial scrutiny may occur in opposition: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths at FCR 377 .... There is a tension between the operation of the presumption and the text and structure of s 41. Section 41(3) requires the Registrar to ""take into account"" the extent to which a mark is inherently adapted to distinguish in deciding whether or not it is ""capable of distinguishing"" the applicant's goods. Section 41(4) then directs the decision-maker to subs 41(5) and subs 41(6), if they are ""still unable to decide the question"". Section 41(5) will be applicable if there is a finding that the mark is to some extent inherently adapted, but the Registrar is ""unable to decide, on that basis alone, that the mark is capable of ... distinguishing"". Accordingly, where there remains some doubt after considering s 41(3) about a mark's capability to distinguish, rather than resolving that doubt in favour of an applicant (by operation of a presumption), the statute expressly directs the decision-maker to consider the criteria in subs 41(5) or subs 41(6) (whichever is applicable). These observations have been followed in several first instance decisions, albeit with varying degrees of caution: see Bennett J in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318 ( Torpedoes ) at [16]-[22], Finn J in Austereo [2004] FCA 968 ; 61 IPR 257 at [4] - [5] and Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; (2005) 66 IPR 131 at [123] - [141] . In Austereo , Finn J considered that he ought ""as a matter of comity"" apply the Lomas standard as adopted by Bennett J in Torpedoes . In Kowa , Lander J expressed some doubt about the point but considered he was bound by Lomas and the Full Court decision in Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365. Guylian did not seek to justify in a substantive way the approach of the Full Court in Lomas . It sought to rely on the decision, and those that have followed it, but it acknowledged that other decisions run counter to it. In my view, there is nothing in the relevant provisions that supports the imposition of a higher standard, even at the acceptance stage. The ""presumption of registrability"" arises from s 33 of the Act: Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 at [24] ; Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 at [50] . Section 33 does not speak of being ""clearly satisfied""; it mandates acceptance of an application unless the Registrar "" is satisfied that ... there are grounds for rejecting it"". On this point, I prefer the views expressed by Gyles J and in particular his Honour's observations that an acceptance that there is a presumption of registrability ""says nothing as to the standard of proof"" and does not import a higher threshold than the conventional balance of probabilities: see Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [18] . The presumption as it is gives effect to the general position under the Act that an applicant is not required to establish an absence of grounds to refuse or object to registration. It should also be noted that in both Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 and Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 (both acceptance stage cases) there is no suggestion that any special higher standard was applicable."
considered,"Sinclair, Scott &amp; Co Ltd v Naughton [1929] HCA 34 ; (1929) 43 CLR 310 at 327","Finally, the Commissioner's reference to and reliance upon the parties' prior and subsequent conduct is misplaced.

I, too, accept this proposition. Its correctness seems to me to follow inexorably from the standing granted to ASIC in the circumstances described in s 462(2)(e) and s 464(1). There will be occasions and this is one where, in the course of an investigation, matters come to the attention of ASIC that motivate it to seek the winding up of a company on the just and equitable ground because it is in the public interest and perhaps also on other grounds, notably, insolvency. As noted, the latter requires a grant of leave to ASIC but the conditions for that are met. I grant leave."

cited,Clark Equipment Co v Registrar of Trade Marks [1964] HCA 55 ; (1964) 111 CLR 511,"The next ground of attack against the registration of the trade mark is that it was not distinctive of Colorado Group's goods. The point arises in the following way. Generally, a word, name or device (or any other designation that may be a ""sign"" for the purposes of the Trade Marks Act ) can only be distinctive of a person's goods or services if it is ""inherently adapted to distinguish"" those goods or services or, if it is not inherently distinctive, if it has become distinctive by use, that is if it has acquired a secondary meaning. A designation that is merely descriptive of the character of the goods or of their geographic origin or location cannot be inherently distinctive.

cited,Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co 192 Cal Reptr 732 (1983),"way of preface I should note that up until final written submissions the case had been prosecuted by Hamilton on the basis that AMC, as Hamilton's fiduciary, held the two trademarks as constructive trustee for it, the marks having been obtained by it in breach of its fiduciary duty to Hamilton. The constructive trust claim and with it, seemingly, the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty were abandoned in Hamilton's written submissions. I say ""seemingly"" in relation to the fiduciary claim because it was scarcely addressed in submissions yet it is anything but non-contentious in the propositions it asserts: see Hospital Products Ltd ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co 192 Cal Reptr 732 (1983); Glover, Commercial Equity: Fiduciary Relationships , 3.48-3.51 (1995); and for the causes of contention in this area of the law see my ""Fiduciary Principle"" in Youdan (ed), Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts , 1 (1989); see also Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Forbes [2006] FCAFC 44 ; (2006) 149 FCR 569 at [11] - [16] . I will return to this in the context of AMC's copyright ownership claim. It was open to Hamilton and AMC to cast their contractual relationship in a way which could, for certain purposes at least, have obliged AMC to act in Hamilton's interests alone or, distinctly, in their joint interests: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [7]-[16]. They chose to formalise their relationship as one of supplier and distributor, a type of relationship which characteristically is designed, subject to contractual limitations, to serve the several interests of the participants: see Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co . The Distribution Agreement, and the parties conduct under in it in relation to the packaging was quite characteristic of this. Dr Keung was permitted to serve AMC's interests in selling products it acquired from Hamilton, by utilising artwork and language which he considered would facilitate the sale of those products in the area of the Agreement, so furthering AMC's own interests. Hamilton, in turn, would thereby have its own interests served to the extent that enhanced sales by AMC would be likely to lead to enhanced orders from Hamilton. While AMC was given latitude in the language so used, Hamilton in turn was able to protect its own interests in this matter. It retained for itself a right to approve all statements made on the packaging because of its exposure to product liability and it insisted that the two language versions had to match (to comply with requirements of the TGA scheme). There was nothing fiduciary in this arrangement though it doubtless required elements of trust, cooperation and reliance by the parties if it was to work effectively. But these element of themselves did not turn a non-fiduciary contractual relationship into a fiduciary and personal one outside of, and potentially inconsistent with, the contract itself: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [11]."
referred to,Allen v Townsend [1977] FCA 10 ; (1977) 31 FLR 431,"those orders be continued against other respondents who are members of the NUW? The answer to this question depends on whether, as members, they are bound to perform and observe the Rules by engaging or not engaging in the conduct which is the subject of his Honour's orders. As officers, they were subject to the rules because they owed fiduciary obligations to the union: cf Allen v Townsend [1977] FCA 10 ; (1977) 31 FLR 431 at 483. Members, as such, do not have equivalent fiduciary obligations. Mr Borenstein nonetheless argued that members of an organisation are under an obligation not to act against the interests of the organisation of which they are members. He submitted that the Rules constituted a compact which defined the relationship between the member and the union. There was, he submitted, an implied restraint against a member acting against the interests of the union by procuring resignations by other members. He referred to Rule 3 of the NUW rules, which provides that, where a member acts in a way that conflicts with the objects of the union, that member may be subject to a charge under Rule 67 for failing to observe the rules of the union. The only object to which he referred was that found in rule 2(44) which was 'To enrol into membership of the union all employees eligible to become members of the union'."
referred to,Russell v Scott [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440,"The presumption of a resulting trust that arises when property is transferred without consideration into the name of a person who is neither the child, adopted child or wife of the transferor, does no more than call for proof of an intention to confer beneficial ownership. Prima facie there is a resulting trust but where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership, the presumption is rebutted (see Russell v Scott ('Russell v Scott') [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440 the case of an aunt who put money into a joint bank account in her name and that of her nephew on the basis that it would be held in trust for the aunt during her lifetime but thereafter the beneficial interest would pass to the nephew). 131 Given Mr Ku's evidence that he prepared the 'Change to company details' form, a copy of which is reproduced in Schedule 1, before his meeting with Luke Song on 25 October, that it bears the date 23 October and was handed by Mr Ku to Mr Kim on 24 October with the request that Mr Kim forward it to ASIC in the express post envelope which Mr Ku provided, I have great difficulty in accepting that, when he was speaking with Luke Song on 25 October 2006, he said: 'I will transfer all my shares of Kjun International Pty Ltd to your son first as good gesture if you sign this agreement.' It is unlikely that he would have used the words mentioned and in particular the word 'if' in circumstances where the 'Change to company details' form had already been prepared, signed and handed to his solicitor Mr Kim for transmission to ASIC in Melbourne. I would place greater emphasis upon the words 'Everyone will say I am the most stupid person doing this but I value more our trust than who is got what and who has the right'. Equally, I have difficulty in accepting that the conversation included the words 'If anything goes wrong I didn't get a single dollar so I can get the shares back'. This is not a case where a resulting trust should be implied if it be found that the shares were duly transferred by Mr Ku to Ji Song. As was said in Russell v Scott there will be no resulting trust where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership. In my opinion such a transfer was intended in respect of the shares but not perfected, there being no duly executed share transfer form which was delivered to Ji Song or another person on his behalf. 132 Mr Ku says that, at the meeting on 25 October, he and Luke Song addressed the longer form of agreement which he had prepared on 24 October 2006. He said in relation to the consideration of the longer form of agreement: 'We ran through all the clauses in the agreement one by one.' 133 Luke Song deposed to the production by Mr Ku of a document with clauses 'A' to 'G' on it. This is hardly illuminating. There was no form of agreement which included clauses A, B, C, D, E, F and G. There were, however, two different forms of agreement which began with 'A' and ended with 'G'. The longer form of agreement included clauses A, B, C, D, D (a second D), F and G. The shorter form of agreement contained clauses A, B, D, F and G."

cited,Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Co v Hy-Line Chicks Pty Ltd [1979] RPC 410,"in Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Co v Hy-Line Chicks Pty Ltd [1979] RPC 410 at 424 Richardson J in the New Zealand Court of Appeal said, in considering a provision similar to s 60, that: for myself I prefer to use a more neutral term such as ""awareness"" or ""cognisance"" or ""knowledge"" and on that basis to ask: having regard to the awareness of the opponent's mark in the New Zealand market for goods covered by the registration proposed, would the use of the applicant's mark be likely to deceive or cause confusion to persons in that market. Fourth, the Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006 (Cth) is helpful in interpreting the s 60. Paragraph 4.10 of the Explanatory Memorandum provides as follows: 4.10 TRADE MARK SIMILAR TO TRADE MARK THAT HAS ACQUIRED A REPUTATION IN AUSTRALIA Section 60(a) 1 . The intention of section 60 of the Act is to implement Australia's obligations to protect well known marks under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Intellectual Property and the 1994 World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The provisions have not been written so as to establish a new class of trade marks (""well-known"" marks) or to prescribe a particular threshold of how well-known a mark must be. Rather, the test has been written so that it can be applied to all marks. The test depends on the extent of the reputation in Australia that has been acquired by a sign. In light of that reputation, the question to be asked is whether the use of a subsequent trade mark would be likely to result in deception or confusion. Section 60 is a ground for opposition to a trade mark application for registration, which can also be used under section 88 as a basis for cancellation of a registration by the courts. 2. Under the current arrangements the provisions of section 60 require that the applied-for mark be substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark forming the basis of opposition before consideration of any deception or confusion, resulting from the reputation of the opponent's trade mark, can take place. Substantial identity and deceptive similarity are tests undertaken in examination of an application before the opposition process, and have very well established scope. 3. There have been a number of instances where a trade mark has an established reputation in Australia, and use of a subsequently applied-for trade mark would deceive or cause confusion, even though the subsequent trade mark is not substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to the original trade mark. However, because of the way paragraph 60(a) of the Act is written it is not possible to currently use this provision to prevent registration of a mark which fails the tests for substantial identity or deceptive similarity, but which nevertheless will cause confusion or deception in relation to a well-known mark. The tests for deception and confusion are all well established in judicial authority, and hinge on the question of whether or not a reasonable number of people may be caused to wonder if a trade connection exists between the marks. By removing the requirement for substantial identity or deceptive similarity from section 60, the ground for opposition under section 60 can be used to oppose the registration of a trade mark because of the possible deception or confusion arising solely from the reputation of a trade mark. 4. Under the amended provisions the consideration of oppositions would take into account the extent of the reputation of the opposing mark at the time the opposed mark was applied for, and the likelihood of deception and confusion occurring in the marketplace because of this. 4.10.1 Items 31 32 1. New paragraph 60(a) of the Act provides that a trade mark may be opposed where another trade mark has a reputation, and the registration of the opposed mark will cause confusion or deception in the market place, whether or not the reputation is built on a mark that is identical or deceptively similar to the opposed mark. In light of this material I consider that the following is clear."
referred to,Carter v Hyde [1923] HCA 36 ; (1923) 33 CLR 115,"The starting point is the option itself. There is no doubt that an option to purchase gives the optionee an equitable interest in the property. In fact the respondents concede that it is a prior equitable interest and that the answer to the first question is yes. There are many authorities on the point. It is sufficient for me to refer to the following: London and South Western Railway Co v Gomm (1882) 20 Ch D 562 at 580-581 per Jessel MR; Carter v Hyde [1923] HCA 36 ; (1923) 33 CLR 115; Commissioner of Taxes (Qld) v Camphin [1937] HCA 30 ; (1937) 57 CLR 127 at 132-134 per Latham CJ. Although Gibbs J (as he then was) in Laybutt v Amoco Australia Pty Ltd (1974) 132 CLR 59 ("" Laybutt "") at 75-76 identified the fact that an option to purchase gave rise to an equitable interest as a strong reason for characterising such an option as a conditional contract, rather than as an irrevocable offer, that 'standing controversy' as Sir Owen Dixon referred to it in Braham v Walker [1961] HCA 7 ; (1961) 104 CLR 366 at 376 has not been resolved and it is not necessary for me to take one view or the other for the purposes of answering the separate questions. It is to be noted that Gibbs J in Laybutt favoured the view that an option to purchase was a conditional contract to sell land which created a contingent equitable interest in the land."
applied,"Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 629 , (1987) ATPR 40-807","Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1987) 18 FCR 212 , a Full Court of this Court held that the Northern Territory and a statutory authority of the Territory were not bound by the Act. Nonetheless, the Court held that there was accrued jurisdiction in this Court in respect of the common law claims brought against them. The Court said (18 FCR at 219): It is true that in answering questions 1 and 2 in the negative, we have determined preliminary points of law in the claims under the Act brought against the second and third respondents; and that, in consequence, there will be no further trial of those issues. But it does not follow that the Court ever lacked jurisdiction to deal with such claims. Nor does it follow that the Court now loses its jurisdiction to deal with the attached common law claims: see Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd [1980] HCA 32 ; (1980) 145 CLR 457 at 469, 472, 477; Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Australia) Pty Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-795 ; 75 ALR 271 , and Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-807 ; 75 ALR 629. In principle, the position is no different than it would have been if the claims under the Act had proceeded to trial and had been dismissed on the merits. In that situation, it could not seriously be suggested that the dismissal of the claims under the Act had the effect of depriving the Court of jurisdiction to deal with any attached non-federal claim. The position may have been different if the claims under the Act had been ""colourable"" in the sense that they were made for the improper purpose of ""fabricating"" jurisdiction: see P H Lane, Lane's Commentary on the Australian Constitution (1986), pp 367-368 and the cases there cited. There is no room for such a suggestion here. The applicants' case that the second and third respondents were bound by the Act cannot be said to be unarguable; and we think it was pursued bona fide: cf R v Cook; Ex parte Twigg [1980] HCA 36 ; (1980) 147 CLR 15 per Gibbs J at 26. Those statements were entirely in line with observations to the same effect made in Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 629 at 632 and in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [1987] FCA 230 ; (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 415 416 (per Gummow J)."
cited,WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Mayo-Ramsay) v Maitland City Council (1998) 83 IR 362,"this case the respondent admits that the result of its conduct was the death of Mr McCallum. While there is no question here that Mr McCallum's death was actually foreseen by the respondent, in my view implementing a work method incorporating an appropriate radio protocol would not have been unreasonable, and to so find now is not, in my view, ""substituting reasonable hindsight for reasonable foresight"" ( WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Mayo-Ramsay) v Maitland City Council (1998) 83 IR 362 at 381). The size of the plant involved, the vulnerability of workers in front of it, and the very real risk of serious injury or death in the absence of a fail-safe means of immediate emergency communication does suggest a systemic failure by the respondent rather than ""a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision"" as contended by the respondent. Indeed, it is not conclusive that there was either inadvertence on the part of Mr McCallum or a momentary lapse in his supervision by Mr Grech and the incident still occurred. It is clear that, despite the efforts taken by the respondent to implement a safe working environment, the operation involving the transportation unit was flawed in its original conception. The dangers were obvious from the start, relatively simple to avoid, but unrecognised and unaddressed in a manner which raises the objective gravity of the offence in these proceedings towards the higher end of the scale. The respondent submits that the improvements made to its work systems and the immediate action it took following the incident indicate that specific deterrence is not a factor of significance in this matter. I disagree. While the initiatives of the respondent are to be applauded, a relevant consideration in respect of the quantum of a penalty is that it be a deterrence to the specific employer in question as well as the community at large (including other employers). The respondent in this case has admitted that the result of its conduct was the death of an employee. It is necessary that the penalty reflect that fact. Further, while the work systems in place at the time of the incident support a finding that the respondent had adopted an approach to safety which was proactive rather than reactive, it is clear from both the obviousness of the risk to which Mr McCallum was fatally exposed and the simple but effective measures put in place since the incident including the adoption of a radio protocol that there were serious deficiencies in the quality of the proactive work undertaken."
cited,Re Turf Enterprises Pty Ltd [1975] Qd R 266,"I have already indicated that the plaintiff has not sought to rely upon any other basis for winding up Dromana than its failure to comply with the statutory demand. Shorn of the presumption of insolvency, that application has been so narrowly drawn as to be doomed to failure: see Ford's Principles of Corporations Law at [27.050]. While on a s 459P application the Court may order that an insolvent company be wound up in insolvency: see s 459A; there is no evidentiary basis before me that could suggest insolvency, other than the non-compliance itself. When viewed in the context of the affidavit evidence that has been filed in support of, and in opposition to, the present application, the position is no different. A serious dispute exists between the parties. But Dromana's insolvency is not suggested: cf Re Turf Enterprises Pty Ltd [1975] Qd R 266. Perhaps it was for this reason that counsel for Mr Gryst apparently accepted that the originating process as it stands could not succeed without the aid of the presumption. I am thus in the position of being satisfied in the circumstances that Mr Gryst has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting his s 459P application. 15 I will in consequence order under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act that the originating process be dismissed. I have directed the parties to file and serve submissions relating to costs."
followed,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd [2000] FCA 66 ; (2000) 96 FCR 389,"This approach is consistent with that expressed by Mansfield J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd [2000] FCA 66 ; (2000) 96 FCR 389 at [38] , [40]. 91 Accepting therefore that the exercise of the power is confined to the purpose stated by Deane J, the question then is whether it follows from the concessions made by Mr Pearson that the Notice was issued other than for the administrative function of determining whether proceedings should be instituted. 92 It is true that Mr Pearson accepted that the information sought by the Notice does not go to establishing any element of a breach of the provisions of s 45(2)(a) or (b) of the Act. But, in my opinion, it does not follow that the decision to issue and serve the Notice was for an improper purpose. There are two reasons for this. 102 Fourth, in Rural Press at [37], Mansfield J agreed with the view expressed by Lockhart J in Kotan . Mansfield J went on at [38] to say that the question of whether the power has been exercised for an improper purpose is a matter to be decided in all the circumstances. I respectfully agree with this observation. 119 The short answer to KAL's submission is that the evidence before me demonstrates that the purpose of the ACCC in deciding to issue the Notice was to obtain evidence of the extent of any contraventions by KAL and evidence going to the quantum of any penalty. All of this might ultimately be used in the event that the ACCC decides to commence proceedings. This purpose falls ""squarely within the Act"": Rural Press at [40]. 120 Reference was made in cross-examination of Mr Pearson to the ACCC's knowledge of difficulties encountered in obtaining an order for discovery and interrogatories in existing proceedings. It has not been demonstrated that this was an actuating purpose in the decision to serve the Notice. 121 The application will be dismissed. I will hear the parties briefly on the question of costs. I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-one (121) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.

The test for relocation is whether it is reasonable in the sense of being practicable in the particular circumstances of the particular applicant ( SZATV at [24]). The answer to that question, in turn, depends upon the framework set by the particular objections raised to relocation (see SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 ; (2009) 174 FCR 415 at [124] per Tracey and Foster JJ)."
cited,Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46,"Early in the history of these provisions it was established that they could not be used to restrict genuine business decisions by an employer, notwithstanding that the objective of the provisions then was the protection of unions and collective action ( Connington v Municipality of Kogarah [1913] AR (NSW) 40 at 44; Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46 at 49; Klanjscek v Silver (1961) 4 FLR 182 at 187; Moss v Fantil Pty Ltd t/as Central Coast Security Services (1994) 58 IR 118 at 127). The underlying principle is that a decision that may affect an employee or a class of employee does not discriminate against or victimise that employee or those employees if it is taken for a sound business reason. This principle has been applied in various situations in more recent times in considering a prohibited reason within the meaning of s 793 and similar provisions. Examples include Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; 108 FCR 90 at [119] [126]; Australian Collieries' Staff Association v BHP Coal Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 318 ; (2000) 99 FCR 137 , particularly at [66] [67]; CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326, particularly at [55] [60]; BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; 102 FCR 97 at [48] ; and Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 , particularly at [294] [302]."
applied,Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 ,"This area of the law is controversial. Choses in action in general are assignable (eg s 12 Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW)). However, a bare right to litigate requires special consideration. Although maintenance was referred to in this context, no submissions were directed to the effect of the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993 (NSW) (cf Campbell J in Mid-City Skin Cancer and Laser Centre Pty Ltd v Zahedi-Anarak (2006) 67 NSWLR 569 at [194]). It is convenient to discuss the cause of action in negligence first. In 1953 the High Court, in Poulton v Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602, in relation to a claim in conversion, baldly said: ""... according to well-established principle, the right was incapable of assignment either at law or in equity"". Lord Roskill said in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 702C: ""Though in general choses in action were assignable, yet causes of action which were essentially personal in their character, such as claims for defamation or personal injury, were incapable of assignment..."" 30 One well established category where an assignment is valid (recognised by the authorities cited in Poulton 89 CLR 540 at 602) is an assignment of property, even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation or, as it was put by Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 at 703, where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired. There is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion. However, based upon the submissions in this case, examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse. Re Daley; Ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd (1992) 37 FCR 390 was cited but the decision turned on what was held to be the assignment of a debt (37 FCR at 394 395). In Monk v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 there had been no assignment of the cheques that would have constituted the necessary property. In that case, Cohen J referred to the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 where it was held (at 757) that the assignment of a debenture by a parent company to a subsidiary included an assignment of causes of action in tort against a receiver of the company that issued the debenture and that the causes of action in tort were ancillary to the assignment of the debenture and so valid. The effect of that decision is somewhat clouded by the subsequent appellate history of the case ( First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1990] 3 NZLR 265; Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993] AC 295) although the appeals did not turn upon the point in issue here. 31 The decision of Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) (2007) 158 FCR 444 may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property. There, the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information, connected with or relating to rights of property that were assigned, was upheld (see particularly 158 FCR 444 at [79] [81]). However, that decision, and others since 1982, have been influenced by dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 indicating another basis for exception from the general rule whether the assignee has a ""genuine and substantial interest in the success of the ... litigation"" (per Lord Wilberforce at 694D) or has a ""genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another"" (per Lord Roskill at 703D). 33 Finkelstein J took the wider view in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd 158 FCR 444 and suggested that the High Court in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 had approved the effect of the statements by Lords Wilberforce and Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679. The precise point that arises here did not arise in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; 229 CLR 386. However, the reasoning of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at [68] [82] and Callinan and Heydon JJ at [258] [261] supports the opinion of Finkelstein J. In my opinion, the principle enunciated in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 can be taken to be established for Australia. It needs to be borne in mind that the statement in Poulton 89 CLR 540 was not the centre of controversy in that case. 34 Did All Saints have a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of Tosich's claim? There is no direct evidence concerning the position of All Saints prior to the transaction. The inescapable inference from all the circumstances, including the structure of the transaction, is that All Saints was under the control of the Warne interests and that the transaction was to ensure that this proceeding continued notwithstanding a reluctance to pursue it on the part of Tosich. In particular, it seems to be aimed at removing or minimising Tosich's risk as to costs. It may be inferred that the purpose was to provide a vehicle for the defendants to pursue their cross-claims with the benefit of a claim proved by a plaintiff. That would remove the kind of problem exemplified by CGU Insurance Ltd v AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 36 ; (2007) 237 ALR 420 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1551 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 609. Indeed, as much was made clear by counsel for the plaintiffs and for the defendants on various occasions. I do not see anything objectionable about that purpose or about the structure of the transaction. All Saints could not profit from the arrangement. It is not ""trafficking"" in causes of actions in any real sense. Facilitation of cross-claims to be determined on their merits is not objectionable as such. However, it seems to me that the dicta in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 would have to be extended to include these circumstances within the permissible categories of assignment. The assignee is not shown to have had any interest in the claim prior to, or regardless of, the assignment. In view of the controversy surrounding the topic, an extension of the categories is not the province of a single judge. 35 What, then, of the connection with property? Austin J found that there were property interests created by the scheme. The deed purports to assign those interests and causes of action, including the present. In one sense, there is a clear connection. The intention is to recover the loss of property invested. However, the claim in negligence is not to recover the property that existed at the time of the transaction it is to recover the loss by way of damages. In my opinion, that is not the kind of claim connected with property that is covered by the traditional exception to the rule against assignment of causes of action, assuming, as I do, that the exception can include claims in tort where appropriate. The assignment of the cause of action in tort is not effective. 36 In the course of argument, counsel for the plaintiffs referred to a claim for money had and received. The Third Amended Originating Process claims, inter alia: ""Orders in the nature of restitutionary orders for the refund to the Plaintiffs of the moneys originally invested in the Queen Victoria Project by the First Plaintiff and interest."" The Third Amended Statement of Claim does not include pleading to support that claim and no amendment has been sought. Such a claim can be ignored for present purposes."

considered,SZLAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 219,"In the present proceeding no explanation was provided as to why there was non-compliance with the required 21 day period, other than the statement this morning by the First Applicant that he was not aware that there was any time limit. In such circumstances, no extension of time is warranted. The discretion to extend time within which to appeal from an interlocutory decision is that conferred by O 52, r 15(2) of the Federal Court Rules and not O 52, r 5(2). And that discretion, as r 15(2) expressly provides, may be exercised "" for special reasons "". In Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195, 70 ALR 185 at 193, Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ helpfully observed in respect to this provision: What is needed to justify an extension of time is indicated in r 15(2) by the words ""for special reasons"". It is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed, though filed after the expiry of twenty-one days. In that context, the expression ""special reasons"" is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days. But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. We do not think the use of the expression ""for special reasons"" implies something narrower than this. ... It should not be overlooked that r 15(2) enables leave to be given ""at any time""; the ""special reasons"" relevant to such a power cannot but describe an elastic test, suitable for application across a range of situations, from an oversight of a day to a neglect persisted in during a prolonged period. It would require something very persuasive indeed to justify a grant of leave after, for example, a year; equally, it may be said, something much less significant might justify leave where a party is a few days late. ""Special reasons"" must be understood in a sense capable of accommodating both types of situation. It is an expression describing a flexible discretionary power, but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify a departure, in the particular circumstances, from the ordinary rule prescribing a period within which an appeal must be filed and served.

cited,Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383,"contraventions on 15, 17 and 21 February 2006 had the same purpose, namely, to coerce Hardcorp to re-employ Messrs Deans and O'Donnell and Ms Singleton at the Mount Street site and, amongst other things, to have Ms Singleton appointed as OH&amp;S officer on the Mount Street site. This was the common thread running through the offending conduct of 15, 17 and 21 February 2006. To this extent, the comparison with Hamberger v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 585 is justified. Further, the fact of this common thread should be taken into account in fixing penalties, but, in my view, the contravening conduct is not, for this reason, properly seen as one course of conduct. This is because the conduct comprising each of the contraventions was separate and distinct in time and place, and in the coercion that the Union exerted. The conduct on 15 February 2006 involved demands and threats to cause trouble at the Mount Street site if the demands were not met. The conduct on 17 February 2006 involved similar demands and threats but on a different day and place, and in a different context with different participants in the occasion of the contravention. The conduct on 21 February 2006 involved Mr Mates coming on to the site and shutting down the crane. Therefore, these are three separate and distinct contraventions: compare Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at 396-399 [41] - [55] ; [2008] FCAFC 70 at [41] - [55] per Stone and Buchanan JJ. As noted above, where (as here) penalties are being imposed for a number of related contraventions, it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate to the circumstances of the case. As Tracey J said in Stuart-Mohoney 177 IR at 73 [60]: Another factor to be considered is the totality principle. This principle is designed to ensure that the aggregate of penalties imputed is not such as to be oppressive or crushing see: Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [30] referred to with approval by Buchanan J in Australian Opthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [89] . The orthodox position requires the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention arising from the same course of conduct. The aggregate figure is then considered to ensure that the penalty is an appropriate response to the conduct in question see: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 238 ; 145 ALR 36 at 53 and Ponzio at [145] per Jessup J. Penalties must also be proportionate to the culpability and seriousness of the respondent's contravening conduct and sufficient to mark the seriousness of that conduct. Neither respondent has expressed any contrition."
distinguished,Macintosh v Dun [1908] UKPCHCA 3 ; (1908) 6 CLR 303 ; [1908] AC 390,"referred to Veda's pleaded defence of qualified privilege at [116] above. The applicants submit that publication by Veda was not made on an occasion of qualified privilege. They rely on Macintosh v Dun [1908] UKPCHCA 3 ; (1908) 6 CLR 303 ; [1908] AC 390.

On appeal, the Privy Council ([1908] AC 390 at 400) referred to the facts that: Their Lordships identified ""the real question"" as being whether it was ""in the interests of the community"" and ""for the welfare of society"" that the protection that the law gave to communications made in legitimate self-defence or from a bona fide sense of duty ""should be extended to communications made from motives of self-interest by persons who trade for profit in the characters of other people"" (at 400). Answering this question ""no"", they added: But information such as that which [the defendants] offer for sale may be obtained in many ways, not all of them deserving of commendation. It may be extorted from the person whose character is in question through fear of misrepresentation or misconstruction if he remains silent. It may be gathered from gossip. It may be picked up from discharged servants. It may be betrayed by disloyal employees. It is only right that those who engage in such a business, touching so closely very dangerous ground, should take the consequences if they overstep the law."
cited,Centurion Roller Shutters Pty Ltd v Automatic Technology (Australia) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1118,"While Mr Perry's submission that the expert opinion of Mr Frick did not comply with the relevant Practice Direction was technically correct, in the circumstances before me I make the following observations: a. It is clear from Mr Frick's affidavit, p 1 of his expert report (MBF-02) and the annexure MBF-03 (the Index to Documents (Crop Expert) indexing the material in the Brief to Crop Expert) that, in preparing his expert report, Mr Frick reviewed data in the Brief to Crop Expert volumes. b. Mr Frick's affidavit with the annexures including the expert report had been available to the applicants since 2006. c. Mr Bell QC informed the Court that the data in the Brief to Crop Expert was already in evidence before the Court at the time Mr Frick was sworn as a witness. I accept this information, and in any event note from reviewing the Brief to Crop Expert that the following material, of which copies were included in the Brief to Crop Expert, was already in evidence by the time that Mr Frick was called as a witness: exhibits A32, A5, R30, A16, A12, A13, A17, A19, A21, A37, A39, A43, A45, A52, A30, A58, A64 and A66. d.

referred to,May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255 ,"Counsel for Sanofi-Aventis submitted that enabling disclosure, not mere disclosure, is required for anticipation, citing, most recently, Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 559 at [160] [161] and the decision of the House of Lords in SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323. By way of introduction, it is worth remarking that the phrase ""enabling disclosure"" was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 , (1996) 36 IPR 438. That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the 1997 United Kingdom Act (based upon the European Patent Convention) but did not concern the question of anticipation. The most important question was whether a later patent could claim an earlier priority date because it was ""supported"" by the earlier specification. That is a concept similar to, but narrower than, whether a later patent is fairly based upon an earlier specification in our law (cf F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commissioner of Patents [1971] HCA 3 ; (1971) 123 CLR 529 ; CCOM Pty Ltd v Jiejing Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1168 ; (1994) 51 FCR 260 ; Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274). It may be accepted that, in the case of a claim for a chemical compound by formula, in order to be valid, the specification would have to disclose how it might be manufactured (s 40). The phrase was also used in the speech of Lord Oliver in Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK's Application [1991] RPC 485 , to which I shall return. The phrase is reasonable shorthand in relation to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but, in my opinion, has little, if any, relevance to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula. Indeed, it is apt to mislead in relation to the latter. For a product claim, the novelty must lie in the product not the means of producing it ( May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255 at 281 282). By the same token, a new process to obtain an old product will have novelty. 64 Something was sought to be made of the fact that PCR 4099 or derivative 1 was not unmistakably pointed to as the best of the compounds. There was competing evidence from the experts related to that question. In my view, that was a red herring as far as novelty is concerned. On any view, it was expressly disclosed as one of the most promising of the compounds. The invention was not limited to the most effective or most promising example. The invention was a broad class. As Lord Hoffmann lucidly explained in Biogen Inc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 at 48 49, 36 IPR 438 at 455: ""If the invention discloses a principle capable of general application, the claims may be in correspondingly general terms. The patentee need not show that he has proved its application in every individual instance. On the other hand, if the claims include a number of discrete methods or products, the patentee must enable the invention to be performed in respect of each of them. Thus if the patentee has hit upon a new product which has a beneficial effect but cannot demonstrate that there is a common principle by which that effect will be shared by other products of the same class, he will be entitled to a patent for that product but not for the class, even though some may subsequently turn out to have the same beneficial effect: see May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd [1950] RPC 23 at 50. On the other hand, if he has disclosed a beneficial property which is common to the class, he will be entitled to a patent for all products of that class (assuming them to be new) even though he has not himself made more than one or two of them."" 77 The first case in the United Kingdom Court of Appeal to consider selection patents was In the matter of Esso Research and Engineering Co's Application (Shell) [1960] RPC 35 where the principle was explained as follows ([1960] RPC 35 at 53): ""So it is that you may have first the scientist who discovers and discloses the whole range and who may obtain patent protection for the subject-matter of his discovery or the means of manufacturing them what Maugham, J. called the ""originating patent"". But within such a range there is room also for the second scientist whose researches may discover and disclose that certain of the items or a section of them have advantages peculiar to themselves, hitherto unknown; and, if so, then there would appear to be no ground on reason or principle why patent protection should not be, in proper cases, available to the second scientist."" (See also Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants' Application, Re [1972] FSR 147, [1972] RPC 364; May &amp; Baker Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255.)"
cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-840,"It has been recognised on a number of occasions that this remedy can be a peculiarly apt one where the contravening conduct occurred in the course of a company's routine business advertising: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-840 at 43,382. In such cases, particularly where no injunction is to be granted, a corrective advertising order can assist in making an advertiser ""more assiduous in ensuring that it does not repeat the contravening conduct"": Prouds Jewellers (No 2) at [13]. The making of such an order would, in my view, be salutary in the present matter. 30 I acknowledge that a considerable period has passed since the offending publication was made. While this may in a given instance be a factor telling against ordering corrective advertising, here it is not. Such an order, coupled with declaratory relief rather than an injunction, provides an appropriate coercive incentive to Harbin. 31 The form of corrective advertisement I will order to be published will be in the terms of that annexed to these reasons. With one necessary modification to reflect my refusal to award injunctive relief, it follows the form proposed by the ACCC."

These four classes are (1) fresh evidence ( Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287 ; Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [No 2] (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61-2); (2) inadvertent error ( Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories); Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts ( Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 ("" UTA "") at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law ( UTA at 478). In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open: see UTA at 478; also The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310 ("" Silver Fox "") at [22] and [25]. 28 The above-mentioned considerations do not, however, persuade me to give the applicants leave to re-open. There are weightier factors militating against the grant of leave. These factors are as follows. (1) The applicants deliberately chose not to quantify the Commonwealth's loss at the first hearing, perhaps because they believed that they could not do so (see their letter of 27 August 2004) or for some other reason. This factor, though not conclusive, is a significant one. (2) Prior to the first hearing, the applicants had plainly led the respondents to believe that the applicants were proceeding on the basis that quantum was irrelevant and, in any case, that the loss could not be quantified. (3) The applicants opened and closed their case on the basis that they had not quantified their loss and did not need to do so. (4) The applicants did not make any application for a split trial, whether by the preliminary determination of a separate question under O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules or otherwise, although it was open to them to do so. (5) By their correspondence and their conduct before and at the first hearing, the applicants led the respondents to understand that they had presented the totality of their evidence at the first hearing. (6) Before the first hearing, the applicants knew that it would be said against them that they could not succeed without evidence quantifying their loss. (7) The respondents prepared, planned and conducted their case on the basis that the applicants would not present quantification evidence. This factor is also significant. In the belief that the applicants were not going to present quantification evidence, Bradshaw contended that the applicants could not succeed without such evidence. As counsel for Bradshaw observed, if the applicants had provided the respondents with some evidence of the quantum of their loss, the respondents might have taken a different view of their claim for payment under the bond. Had he not been led to believe that there would be no evidence of quantification, Bradshaw would presumably have conducted his case differently. (8) Whilst there were no pleadings, the issue in debate was clearly addressed in the correspondence between the parties prior to the first hearing. (9) In circumstances where the applicants had full knowledge of the considerations relevant to their conduct and proceeded on a particular basis, the public interest in the finality of litigation weighs strongly against permitting them to depart from that basis: compare Silver Fox at [25] and the cases there cited. (10) In the circumstances outlined, a costs order is inadequate compensation to the respondents and, in any event, does not satisfactorily meet the public interest in finality of litigation. I would therefore refuse the application to reopen the applicants' case."

considered,Re Bauhaus Pyrmont Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2006] NSWSC 543,"The respondents submit that Mr Glover's claim to ""maintain"" the privilege is said to derive from Stage 5's shareholding in the applicant, which is then said to give it an interest in the outcome of the proceeding. They contend that it is a question of fact whether, in a particular case, a shareholder has such an interest, and that in a case such as the present, where the applicant is clearly insolvent, no such interest exists because Stage 5's shareholding is valueless. They rely on Re Bauhaus Pyrmont Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2006] NSWSC 543 ( Bauhaus ). There, one Widdup was a director of the company in liquidation and the indirect owner of all the company's shares. Justice Austin held that Mr Widdup did not have a common interest in privileged documents given to him because there was no prospect of a distribution to contributors in the winding up. 18 The respondents rely on the matters set out at [10] to show that Stage 5 stands in the same position as Mr Widdup in Bauhaus . The applicant sought to distinguish Bauhaus on the ground that it concerned a liquidator of a company giving privileged documents to a shareholder who, at the time of receipt, had no prospect of a return from the winding up. 19 Section 122(5)(b) of the Evidence Act (set out at [11]) excludes the waiver provisions of sub-ss (2) and (4) in relation to a disclosure to a person who, at the time of the disclosure , shared a common interest with the client. Accordingly, I accept the applicant's submission that common interest is to be tested at the time Mr Glover came into possession of the documents. 20 The party claiming privilege has the onus of establishing the basis of the claim. Order 33 rule 11(1) of the Federal Court Rules provides that: Where the Court, by subpoena or otherwise, orders any person to produce any document or thing, and any person makes and substantiates sufficient lawful objection to production on grounds of privilege, the Court shall not compel production of that document or thing except production to the Court for the purpose of ruling on the objection. (Emphasis added.) 21 The expression ""ground of privilege"" is defined in rule 11(5) as a ground on which a person may rely to make an objection under Part 3.10 of the Evidence Act . That includes common interest privilege. See s 122(5)(b) and Bauhaus at [24]. On onus in relation to client legal privilege in general, see Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority (2002) 4 VR 332 at 337. The claimant must establish the facts giving rise to the privilege: National Crime Authority v S (1991) 100 ALR 151 at 158-159."
referred to,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142,"Even if I am wrong and the Magistrate erred in not making a finding of fraud, such a finding would not lead to the setting aside of the Tribunal's decision. The effect of fraud by a migration agent on a decision of the Tribunal was considered by the Full Court of this Court in the recent decision of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 (' SZFDE '). Applicants for a protection visa engaged a man who said he was a solicitor with a lot of experience in migration matters. Unbeknown to the applicants he had been struck off as a solicitor and deregistered as a migration agent. He told the applicants that they should not accept an invitation to appear before the Tribunal at an oral hearing because their application would be refused. He told them that he was going to write to the Minister on their behalf and he was concerned that if they appeared before the Tribunal they might say something inconsistent with what he said in the letter. He told them not to worry, that he was doing what was best for them. The Magistrate found that the agent had acted dishonestly and fraudulently. In other word s, his advice was not only bad, but also fraudulent. A majority of the Court (Allsop and Graham JJ) said that the fraud in that case did not provide a basis for setting aside the decision of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was not aware of the fraud and had complied with the Act in terms of extending an invitation to the applicants (ss 425 , 425A ). 30 Allsop J said that the decision of the Tribunal was not induced or affected by fraud (at [136]). Allsop J made the point that in the circumstances of the case before him the fraud was linked to the complaint that there had been a failure of procedural fairness. The complaint of a lack of procedural fairness could not succeed in light of ss 422B , 425 and 426A of the Act. Allsop J also said that it was not a case where it could be said that the statutory process was corrupted by fraud (at [139]). Graham J also dismissed the challenge based on fraud saying that even if there was fraud it was of no relevance (at [191] and [237]). 31 French J dissented. His Honour held that the fraud of the agent gave rise to a jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal, saying that the Tribunal made its decision (at [131]): '... blamelessly but pursuant to a process which, unknown to it, was compromised by third party fraud.' 32 On the basis of the majority decision in SZFDE the appellant's submission that the fraud of Mr Han (assuming, contrary to my earlier conclusion, that he was fraudulent) vitiates the decision must be rejected. 33 The appellant's alternative submission was that the agent's conduct led to a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and that that gave rise to a jurisdictional error. This submission raises two questions. First, absent the particular statutory context, is there what might perhaps be called a general rule that there is a breach of the rules of procedural fairness if a party fails to attend a hearing due to the erroneous advice of his agent? Secondly, if there is such a rule, does the particular statutory context negate the rule or the granting of relief. I realise that dividing the issue into two questions is somewhat artificial, but I think it does assist in the overall analysis. 34 There are many cases in which the courts have considered whether, in the absence of fault on the part of the decision-maker, there can be a breach of the rules of procedural fairness. A number are discussed in the reasons for judgment of French J in SZFD E (see also Aronson, Dyer and Groves, Judicial Review of Administration Action (3 rd ed, 2004) pages 460-463). They can perhaps be placed in various categories depending on one or more of: the powers the Court was exercising; the status of the person at fault (ie, party's agent, other party to the proceeding or a third party); the nature of the conduct of the party at fault (ie, fraudulent or negligent); and the effect of the procedural departure. It seems fairly clear on the authorities that there can be a breach of the rules of procedural fairness in the absence of fault on the part of the decision-maker: Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy [2002] HCA 51 ; (2002) 210 CLR 438 per Gleeson CJ at 448 [22]. Equally, it seems clear on the authorities that there is no breach of the rules of procedural fairness if the fault leading to the procedural departure was that of the agent of the applicant for relief. That was the view of the House of Lords in Al-Mehdawi (supra) and of French J (at [101]-[103]) and Allsop J (at [138]) in SZFDE . The appellant's alternative submission fails on this ground. 35 The submission would fail in any event because even if there was such a general rule it could not operate in the context of the provisions of the Act. Section 422B provides that Division 4 of Part 7 is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with. Section 425 requires that the Tribunal must invite an applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. That invitation was given in this case. Section 426A provides that where an applicant fails to appear in response to an invitation, the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it. That is how the Tribunal decided to proceed in this case and it was entitled to do so. The conclusion that the statutory provisions allow no room for a claim that there was a breach of the rules of procedural fairness based on the erroneous advice of an applicant's agent was a conclusion reached by a majority of the Court in SZFDE (per Allsop J at [138] per Graham J at [237]-[239]). 36 The decision of the Tribunal did not involve jurisdictional error and the Magistrate's decision that the application was not competent was correct. 37 The appeal must be dismissed with costs.

discussed,London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenlands Ltd [1916] 2 AC 15,"Privy Council's decision has been criticised. In Watt v Longsdon [1930] 1 KB 130 at 148, Scrutton LJ said that the decision ""must not be relied on too strongly"" in the light of the decision of the House of Lords in London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenlands Ltd [1916] 2 AC 15 ( Greenlands ). In Greenlands the House distinguished Macintosh v Dun . The case concerned the London Association for the Protection of Trade (Association) which had over 6,000 members who paid an annual subscription. A member (Kydd) applied to the Association on a form provided by it for information on the commercial standing of a trading company (Greenlands) with which Kydd proposed to deal. The secretary to the Association (Hadwen) applied to a commercial agent and debt collector (Wilmshurst) at Hereford where Greenlands carried on business for such information. Having obtained the information from Wilmshurst, Hadwen passed it onto Kydd. Greenlands sued Wilmshurst, the Association and Hadwen for libel. A jury returned verdicts against all three defendants, finding express malice against Wilmshurst. The Association and Hadwen appealed. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial as against them. On the further appeal to the House of Lords, Greenlands consented to have the judgment against the Association set aside because it transpired that it was an unincorporated association. The point of distinction that seems to be common to their Lordships' speeches is that in Greenlands the Association was an unincorporated not-for-profit association who business was carried on by a committee, which did not operate solely from motives of pecuniary gain, and Hadwen did not act as agent of the Association but as agent of Kydd. Their Lordships emphasised that whether qualified privilege was attracted depended on a close scrutiny of all the circumstances of the individual case. The present cases share some features with both Macintosh v Dun and Greenlands . Like the defendants in Macintosh v Dun : Veda is motivated by the desire for pecuniary gain; Veda is not itself in the business of providing credit but is in the different business of collecting and providing, for reward to itself, creditworthiness information sought by credit providers. On the other hand, as in Greenlands : It seems clear that if Veda had remained a mutual association it would have been indistinguishable for present purposes from the Association in Greenlands or from the association of stock salesmen in Howe and McColough v Lees . Senior counsel for Veda informed the Court that Veda ""demutualised and became a public company in the late 1990s"". He submits that it would be ""incongruous"" and would be ""the sort of thing that brings the common law into disrepute"" if such a change in formal status could cause Veda to lose the defence of qualified privilege."
referred to,VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471,"The reference to ""information"" in s 424A does not encompass a failure to mention a matter to the Tribunal.

applied,Golden Strait Corporation v Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha (The Golden Victory) [2005] 1 Lloyd's Law Rep 443; [2005] 2 Lloyd's Law Rep 747,"None of the cases which make reference to a substituted cargo and an obligation, on part of the shipowner, to obtain it, suggest that there is a ' rule ' to that effect which is of universal application, applying in every case involving a failure to supply cargo. The reference in the ' rule ' to the deduction of market freight, which was or could have been earned, expresses no more than what a shipowner, having a vessel available for the charter, would do in the ordinary course of business and acting reasonably. It is assumed that the shipowner would go into the market and obtain a substitute cargo. Likewise where a shipowner breaches a charterparty it is assumed that the charterer will charter a substitute vessel and this is reflected in statements of the ' normal ' measure of damage: Koch Marine Inc v D'Amica Societa Di Navigazione A.R.L (The Elena D'Amico) [1980] 1 Lloyd's Law Rep 75 (' The Elena D'Armico '). It is the operation of mitigation principles which are responsible for the rule.

considered,Apand Pty Limited v The Kettle Chip Company Pty Limited [1994] FCA 1370 ; (1994) 52 FCR 474,"first point to be made is that registration is sought of a composite mark, consisting of a number of elements. The parties do not dispute that it is necessary to look at the whole trade mark in context, including the size and prominence of the words, where they appear and the material surrounding the words. Clearly, in assessing the impact of the various elements of the trade mark as judged by the eye, factors such as the relative size of the letters and the prominence of the words are of importance ( Apand Pty Limited v The Kettle Chip Company Pty Limited [1994] FCA 1370 ; (1994) 52 FCR 474 at 488-489). Does the word BAVARIA as used in the trade mark connote the State of Bavaria? Accepting that the word alone may have that connotation the question, as I observed in [70], is whether the remaining elements of the trade mark dispel that association. As in Kettle Chip , where a separate ""Smith's"" logo that appeared on the appellant's packaging did not save the naming of a product ""Country Kettle"" from constituting passing off in relation to the respondent's product sold under the name ""The Kettle Chip Co"" or ""The Kettle Chip"", BBA submits that HOLLAND does not save Bavaria NV's product from representing a Bavarian origin or association. However, in the absence of direct evidence from consumers one way or the other, my view is that the reasonable consumer would not fail to observe the three references to ""Holland"" which, at least, neutralise the connotation with the State of Bavaria. It follows that if the consumer were interested in the source of the beer, an examination of the label bearing the trade mark would indicate an origin in Holland. Further, Bavaria NV submits that, so far as consumers are concerned, a reference which might connote an origin is not necessarily determinative for the consumer of the place where the beer is made. This is borne out by research which showed that the Australian consumer sees European beers generally as being from Europe but does not distinguish between different European countries. There is no basis for BBA's assertion that the Australian consumer would associate the trade mark with a State coat of arms."

Concerning that question, the majority (Tamberlin and Hely JJ) said in the Maria Luisa at [61]-[66]: 61 The word ""owner"" cannot be given any general description. But ordinarily the incidents of ownership of a chattel include the right to make physical use of the chattel, the right to the income from it, the power of management, and the right of alienation: ... . In the ""Iron Shortland"" ... Sheppard J quoted from the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal ... that the term ""owner"" means any person who is vested with such ownership as to have the right to sell, dispose of or alienate the ship, and that a beneficial owner of the ship comes within that term ... . 62 The notion of ""ownership"" carries a connotation of dominance, ultimate control and of ultimate title against the whole world ... . ... 65 A helpful description of ""ownership"" is formulated by Jordan CJ in Gatwood v Alley ... where his Honour said in relation to a question as to ownership of a car: ""A good title to property, in the sense of such ownership as the law allows, consists in having the legal right to exercise with respect to it all such rights, as against all such persons, as by law are capable of being exercised with respect to property of the class in question. A person who has possession of property but not ownership has, as a general rule, the same legal rights as the owner, save to the extent to which those rights are qualified as against the owner ... ."" 66 Ownership, whether legal or equitable, therefore involves something greater than beneficial interest. Equitable ownership of property is commensurate with the right to relief in a Court of Equity ... . If a person has contractual rights in relation to a ship which, if performed will result in the person becoming the owner of the ship, then the person will be regarded as the equitable owner of the ship provided that specific performance of the contract would be decreed ... . 39 Their Honours then referred to the decision in the Maria Luisa and, at [97], continued: The Full Court decided The Maria Luisa in the context of the earlier decision of Sheppard J in The Iron Shortland that the word ""owner"" was not restricted to registered owner, but extended to include the ""true"" or ""real"" or ""beneficial"" owner. It was not necessary for the Full Court to decide the question before us, that is whether the phrase ""the owner"" necessarily included the registered owner. 40 After referring to various authorities their Honours observed at [119]-[120]: 119 As is clear ... notions of ""property"" and ""ownership"" are not amenable to crisp, comprehensive definition in the abstract. The context, here is the possession and enjoyment of, dominion over and power or right to dispose of, a chattel of a kind that is usually engaged in commercial enterprise. In that context, the word ""ownership"" or ""owner"" connotes the right or power to have and dispose of dominion, possession and enjoyment of the ship, subject of course to intervening interests ... . 120 This kind of dominion, exemplified or epitomised by the lawful power or right to dispose of the ship, may arise from the legal effect of dealing between the parties with a ship, under general law or statute. 41 The Court considered the legal consequences of registration, discussing the purposes thereof which include the protection of the title of the registered owner and the protection and preservation of priorities between security interests in the ship. The Court then turned to the question of choice of law. At [140] the Court concluded that the proper law, for the purpose of determining questions of jurisdiction, was the law of the forum (Australia), including its rules of private international law. Their Honours considered that in connection with questions concerning transfer of title to a chattel, those rules would normally lead to application of the lex situs of the chattel. However the Court identified difficulties in determining the situs of a merchant ship. At [146]-[147], their Honours said: 146 There seem to us to be powerful reasons for giving effect to the law of the country of register as the lex situs in relation to questions of title, property and assignment (subject, of course, to local statute and public policy). The chance location of a working merchant ship in a port within its range of sailing or on the high seas appears to introduce an element of arbitrariness to the legal analysis. This is especially so if, as is likely, the national register and registration laws of the port in question are directed to ships of that country. If a law of a country other than the country of registration is chosen to deal with the assignment of property in a ship, it is likely that there will be no statute dealing with registration that is made relevant. 147 The relevant choices appear to be the law of the forum, the law of the country of registry as the lex situs (and not merely when the ship is on the high seas), the law of the place of the ship within another country's territorial waters, (and on one reading of [certain decisions]) the law of the domicile of the registered owner or operator. 42 In any event, in the absence of any evidence as to foreign law, their Honours concluded that the question of choice of law was ""academic"". The Court acted upon the presumption that the relevant foreign law was the same as the law of the forum, Australia. Without necessarily conceding the correctness of the approach their Honours accepted that the lex situs (ie the law of the registration state) should be presumed to contain a statute in a form, mutatis mutandis, the same as the Shipping Registration Act 1981 (Cth). Section 45 of that Act provided: The owner of the ship or of a share in a ship has power, subject to this Act and to any rights and powers appearing in the Register to be vested in any other person, absolutely to dispose of the ship or share and to give effectual receipts in respect of the disposal. 43 At [161] the Honours continued: A power of that kind may well, in many circumstances, suffice to support the conclusion that the holder of such power was ""the owner"". It is a power which is the equivalent of the epitome of ownership. A party who has power absolutely to dispose of a chattel has the equivalent of the ultimate incident of ownership. The power derives from statute; it is not a ""right"" arising from a consensual transaction; but it is a power having equivalent effect. 44 At [163] their Honours observed: It is necessary, however, to assess the importance of this power ... by reference to the surrounding factual circumstances. 45 Relevantly, the registered owner had, in fact, sold the ship and received the sale price. The Court continued at [165]-[168]: 165 Under Australian law, and we would venture to suggest, the law of any other country, subject to any statute affecting the position, [the buyer] took full property in the ship. 166 On the assumption that the [Shipping Registration Act] applies, [the owner] had a power, given by statute, absolutely to dispose of the ship. In the circumstances that obtained, however, [the owner] could not, on any view, exercise that power lawfully or honestly without the consent of [the buyer]. It had transferred the ship, relinquished its rights in her and been paid in full for her. No circumstance could be shown for the honest or lawful exercise of the statutory power, without the consent of [the buyer]. 167 In these circumstances, the holding of the statutory power of absolute disposition was empty of real and practical meaning or significance. So to conclude is not to change the content of the power, but to direct attention to the relevant question to be answered. Was a party who had entered and completed this transaction and who held a statutory power (the primary purpose of which was the protection of the next registered owner, conformably with honest dealing, who had taken the property according to the transaction just completed) in circumstances where there could be no occasion for the honest and lawful use of a power, ""the owner"" of the ship? 168 In our view, the answer to that question is ""no"". [The owner] had no rights of dominion, enjoyment or control over the ship arising from its dealing with [the buyer] or from its relationship with the ship. It had, by the law of the flag (on the hypothesis of the relevance of the [Shipping Registration Act] by the presumption) a power to dispose of the ship, but that power was incapable of lawful or honest exercise, without the consent of [the buyer]. So understood, the power does not amount to a right of ownership. 46 The plaintiff submits that I should accept registration of the Ship in Qatar as proof of ownership. Exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Hockaday, filed on 17 September 2008, are Resolution No 18 of 1980G and Law No 19 of 1980G, both apparently promulgated by the Amir. The first concerns registration of ships and safety conditions in Qatar. The second concerns registration and safety pertaining to small ships in that country. I understand it to be accepted that these documents contain the relevant aspects of the Law of Qatar concerning the registration of ships. Resolution No 18 provides that a ship, the total tonnage of which is 200 ton or more, may not sail under the flag of Qatar unless it is registered according to that Resolution. Vessels under 200 ton may be registered under Resolution No 18, but such registration is not mandatory. Law No 19 provides for an alternative system of registration for vessels under 200 ton. It is not immediately clear whether the Ship was registered under Resolution No 18 or Law No 19. However the application for registration indicates that its ""GRT"" (presumably gross registered tonnage) is 200 ton, whilst its net registered tonnage is 60 ton. It is not clear whether it is the gross or net tonnage which applies for the purposes of Regulation No 18. Nor is it clear whether the various references to tonnage in the evidence, in Resolution No 18 and in Law No 19 are to metric tonnes or imperial tons. Law No 19 establishes a register called ""The Small Ships Register"". There is no indication on the certificate of registration, or on the application for registration, that the Ship was, or was to be, on any such register. It seems more probable than not that it was registered under Resolution No 18. Article 7 of that resolution provides for registration of ownership details. Article 8 requires that the ship owner, supplier or captain notify the registration office of any amendment made to the registered details. Article 13 provides: Every legal act or incident or a judgment resulting in transferring, or amending or forfeiting an in-kind right on a registered ship shall not be in force between the concerned people or for the third party unless its registration is made in the ships register. The concerned parties have right to apply for registration. If any one of them refrains, the matter may be presented to the court for ordering it. 47 Article 14 provides: The registration order shall be as per the date of entry in the journal. If many applications are presented related to one ship in one day, the priority among them shall be as per the time of depositing the registration application, and if many applications are presented together in one hour, all of them shall be deemed in one order. 49 The plaintiff also submits that the Amir's entitlements under the agreement, coupled with the substantial part-payments, were sufficient to create an equitable interest equivalent to ownership for the purposes of s 17. However such equitable and/or contractual rights were obviously subject to the limitation imposed by cl 16 of the agreement. It cannot be said that at the relevant time, the Amir had either the right to possession of the Ship or the right to dispose of it, other than subject to the rights of Sovereign. It was not simply a question of paying the outstanding balance of the purchase price. Mr Royet's evidence demonstrates that prior to 21 July 2008, the Ship had not been completed to the satisfaction of the Amir or his agent. Until such time as the Amir elected to accept the vessel in substantial satisfaction of Sovereign's obligations under the agreement, he could not have insisted upon physical delivery. This is relevant to the point made by Tamberlin and Hely JJ in the Maria Luisa at [74]. Prior to 21 July 2008 the Amir had not exercised his right to accept the vessel pursuant to the contract. He was in a position which might well have led to ownership but did not satisfy the requirements of, in this case, s 17. 50 Finally, the plaintiff submits that the agreement was amended so that property passed at some earlier time and prior to 9 or 11 June 2008. The evidence of this amendment is said to be Sovereign's provision of the builder's certificate, the apparent delay in completion and Amiri Yachts' entitlement under the agreement to take possession of the Ship in the event of default by Sovereign (cl 13) and to insure (cl 15). Against this is Mr Lloyd's assertion that prior to 21 July 2008 Sovereign remained in possession and full control of the Ship. It is true that in para 7 of his affidavit, he did not refer to title. He had done so in cl 6, but the relevant passage was objected to and excluded, largely because it went to the proper construction of the agreement. The evidence of both Mr Lloyd and Mr Royet suggests that the parties were, until 21 July 2008, conducting themselves upon the basis that the Ship was still under Sovereign's legal and physical control. In those circumstances, I decline to infer that there had been any variation to the provisions of the agreement concerning the passing of property."

referred to,SZMRD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 598,"SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 , Lander J was confronted with an application for leave to amend a Notice of Appeal and an application to adduce further evidence, being the transcript of the proceeding before the Tribunal. In refusing leave to amend, His Honour referred to those principles relevant to the grant of leave to raise new grounds on appeal but further observed (in part): [21] Parliament has given the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction in relation to applications of this kind to the exclusion of this Court: s 476A of the Act. All of the issues which are sought to be ventilated should be addressed at the trial in that Court. Parliament has provided for a right of appeal to this Court and in matters of this kind the appellate jurisdiction of this Court may be exercised by a single Judge: s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Indeed, that is the case on this appeal. ... [24] The appellate process is to correct error. If a party is entitled to raise issues for the first time on appeal, the appeal court will become de facto the primary court. That is undesirable. It is particularly undesirable where the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is being exercised by a single judge and any right of appeal from that single judge is to the High Court. If a party is entitled to raise an issue for the first time on appeal in this Court, the High Court will be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from judges sitting alone who have not had their decision reviewed. That must be particularly undesirable from the High Court's point of view. [25] Moreover, to allow new grounds of appeal is to defeat the purpose of the legislation which requires that judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to be within solely the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. If new grounds are advanced on appeal, it effectively means that the jurisdiction is being exercised by this Court. [26] Of course, appeals of this kind are particularly sensitive: Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788. It is particularly important to the party seeking refugee status that that party's claim be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law. That said, however, it seems to me that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction that parties be bound by the way in which they conducted their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court: H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 ; (2000) 63 ALD 43.

considered,Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241,"It was contended by KPMG that a company's auditor does not owe to a third party, such as a shareholder as an individual investor (rather than as a member of the company) or any other investor, a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss save in circumstances where the auditor has specifically and intentionally assumed responsibility for providing the third party with the relevant information for the purpose that it be relied upon by the third party in doing precisely what the third party did. Reference was made to Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241 at 252, 258, 266 and 289; D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 223 CLR 1 at 35 per McHugh J; R Lowe Lippman Figdor &amp; Franck v AGC (Advances) Ltd [1992] 2 VR 671 at 682 and 685; Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] UKHL 2 ; [1990] 2 AC 605 at 629, 654 and 662; Hercules Management Ltd v Ernst &amp; Young [1997] 2 SCR 165 at [37]. 54 It was also contended by KPMG that to the extent the respondents relied upon the concept of ""vulnerability"", this was misconceived because there was here a potential indeterminate liability and an ability by the investors (including the applicant) to protect themselves. Further, it was contended that the concept of ""vulnerability"" may not be used to circumvent the historical preconditions to a claim for negligent misstatement against auditors as set forth in such cases as Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241, when these preconditions establish the minimum threshold of ""vulnerability"" in factual situations in which they apply . 55 In considering these contentions, it is important to appreciate the context in which I am considering the issue of whether a duty of care as alleged by the respondents arises. My task is to determine, on this aspect, whether a duty of care may exist in the context of the principles I have identified previously in these reasons relevant to the application of O 15A r 6. 56 In this context, I have come to the conclusion that the facts and elements relied upon by the respondent may give rise to the alleged duty of care to avoid pure economic loss, such facts and elements being ""salient features"" which may give rise to the alleged duty. 57 On the basis of the material before me, I have not come to the view that the alleged duty of care is ill-founded or doomed to fail, or that, in adopting the test to be applied in considering an application under s 31A of the Federal Court Act, the potential cause of action could be dismissed or struck out. I do not accept that Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241, and the other cases referred to by KPMG, lay down any preconditions to liability of auditors where we are not dealing with a claim for negligent misstatement and where the concept of vulnerability may become relevant and where all the salient features of the case need to be examined. No one salient feature is decisive, and all the facts and circumstances relied upon need to be considered. It can be accepted that auditors do not owe a duty as alleged merely by virtue of their acting in the capacity as auditors. However, more is relied upon by the respondents namely the facts and elements referred to earlier. 60 The concept of vulnerability is now an important requirement in providing a basis for a duty of care to avoid economic loss. It cannot be said that the decision in Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 should not be considered in light of the concept of vulnerability. Both these propositions follow from the passage in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 ; (2004) 216 CLR 515 at [23] (footnotes omitted): Since Caltex Oil , and most notably in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd , the vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed. ""Vulnerability"", in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, ""vulnerability"" is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff's inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant. So, in Perre , the plaintiffs could do nothing to protect themselves from the economic consequences to them of the defendant's negligence in sowing a crop which caused the quarantining of the plaintiffs' land. In Hill v Van Erp , the intended beneficiary depended entirely upon the solicitor performing the client's retainer properly and the beneficiary could do nothing to ensure that this was done. But in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords , the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money, rather than depend upon the auditor's certification of the accounts of the company. 61 As was observed though, in Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money, this being relevant to ""vulnerability"". 62 In Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 the appellant was a sophisticated investor well able in the circumstances to protect itself. It at least had a capacity to consider the investment, whereas in this proceeding the complaint is that the vulnerability arises after the making of the investment, where the investor arguably has no ability to look after itself. The concept of the ability to protect oneself is always relative and will depend upon many factors and circumstances. These are yet to be fully investigated in this proceeding. 68 Of course, there are other policy considerations that may impact upon whether the court should deny the duty of care alleged here, namely the impact of prolonged and multiple actions against auditors, the availability of other civil and criminal proceedings against auditors, and the public interest in ensuring there are auditors ready and willing to perform their duties at a reasonable cost. These matters were raised in Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 at 282 to 289 per McHugh J. They are matters which need to be considered, but none in my view are of sufficient weight in the context of my inquiry to conclude that the facts and elements relied upon by the respondents could not give rise to a duty of care as alleged. It is still not possible to identify precisely a line of demarcation between the cases of pure economic loss in which damages are recoverable and those in which they are not recoverable, but I am not satisfied, even adopting the test under s 31A of the Federal Court Act, that this is a case where damages may not be recoverable: see generally Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 70 IPR 146. 69 As I have said, I am considering the question of whether a duty of care may arise in the circumstances contended for by the respondents. Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 may well be an authority which raises many difficulties for the respondents, but it does not stand in the way of the possibility in the circumstances of this proceeding that a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss exists."

considered,29 Equities Ltd v Bank Leumi (UK) Ltd [1986] 1 WLR 1490,"In its natural and ordinary meaning in factor 5(b) the word 'cannot' means that it is not possible to decrease the quantity. In other contexts the word 'cannot' has a natural and ordinary meaning of excluding the possibility of something occurring. So, in 29 Equities Ltd v Bank Leumi (UK) Ltd [1986] 1 WLR 1490 at 1496G-H Dillon LJ said that it was a simple question of fact to be decided in the light of common sense whether at the date on which a vendor purported to rescind a contract of sale a licence 'cannot be obtained'. And, in The Newbattle (1885) 10 PD 33 the English Court of Appeal held that a statutory provision referring to a ship which 'cannot be arrested' connoted that it was impossible to arrest the ship.

applied,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SBAN [2002] FCAFC 431,"The Committee was required to prepare a Draft Report setting out its preliminary findings subs 106KD(1) of the Act. It was submitted that the fact that those views were unfavourable to Dr Mathews is not, of itself, evidence of bias or pre-judgment: see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SBAN [2002] FCAFC 431 at [11] . That is undoubtedly correct. 32 The Committee discussed Dr Mathews' submissions on the Draft Report in the Final Report at [95] [100]. It declared at [96] that after careful consideration of the submissions, it was not persuaded to change its finding that Dr Mathews engaged in inappropriate practice in relation to the referred services. Dr Mathews characterises his submissions as 'careful, detailed and reasoned' and the amendments which the Committee made in its Final Report as 'grudging and minor', but it was submitted that the use of emphatic language, without more, is unhelpful. It was further submitted that, in essence, Dr Mathews' contention is that a finding of apprehended bias should be made merely because the Committee did not accept the changes to the Draft Report which he proposed. In my view, there is substance in that submission. 33 Dr Mathews selected four examples to demonstrate the alleged pre-judgment. These were summarised in the respondents' written outline of submissions as follows: ' (a) Appendix 1, service no. 4 At the Committee hearing on 30 October 2003 the applicant told the Committee that he referred the patient to an allergy specialist, ordered an IGE test, thinks he performed a spirometry test and that ""the management plan for her was Ventolin."" In the Draft Report the Committee said inter alia that there was insufficient evidence of the development or implementation of an adequate management plan for the patient's presenting problem. The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I do not accept this reason. I referred the patient to an allergy specialist; ordered an IGE pathology test and performed a spirometry test. I had also been prescribing her Ventolin. In my submission that must fall within the range of what is an acceptable management plan. In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (b) Appendix 2, service no. 1 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation. At the Committee's request, he read out his clinical note: ""Vomiting, Promethazine, 4 u.e., urea, electrolytes and creatinine which is in those days I think they were bundled in together with a liver function test in those days I think."" In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that ""At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 40 year old patient presenting with a migraine headache."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I did record a selective history of ""vomiting"". I knew from the visit the previous day that the patient was suffering from migraine. There was a management plan recorded which was to give the patient an injection of Promethazine and I advised her to undergo further tests to check her liver function, kidney function and the state of her hydration."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (c) Appendix 2, service 3 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation. He read out his clinical note: ""FOC, Ceclor CD, Ventolin and Becloforte. In answer to a question about whether he performed a peak-flow reading, he said: ""I did not perform a peak flow reading, it is not written down. I do not know whether I did. Sometimes yes I did but it is not written down there so I do not recall. In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that ""At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 15 year old patient who had a flare up in his chest. No peak flow reading was performed on this young patient who had a history of asthma."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I did record a selective history with my shorthand notation 'FOC'. The patient's history of asthma and smoking was known to me. I did record my management plan which was to prescribe Ceclor for his chest infection; Ventolin and Becloforte for the patient's asthma. The evidence does not indicate that a peak flow reading was not performed and in my submission the Committee cannot make such a finding (see T p 26 line 31 ff)."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (d) Appendix 3, service 15 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that: ""I gave him the Ducene in an attempt to reduce his alcohol consumption and because of the anxiety associated with living with his partner, Christine, who was an invalid. So in a fashion he was a carer, and as I said, his legs he had been my patient for probably 15 years."" The applicant also told the Committee that: ""The presenting complaint with Ron was that he was had massive anxiety because he was worried about Christine and his knees there is a note before approximately 6 or 8 weeks before, that his knees and his lumbar sacral spine, because when Christine fell over he would have to pick her up, and as I said he has I have asked him to have his knees x-rayed many, many times. He has never had it x-rayed. He is non-compliant. In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia: ""No evidence that this service was other than a simple problem requiring minimal input, limited examination and management. In Dr Mathew's oral evidence he stated that he wrote a prescription for Ducene for the pain to damaged knees."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report that: ""I do not agree with this view of the consultation. At T p 49 line 32, I said that I gave Ducene in an attempt to reduce the patient's alcohol consumption, not for pain. My oral evidence indicates that this was not a straightforward consultation having regard to the underlying social problems within the patient's household. The patient's knees have been a matter of ongoing concern for some time."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in its Draft Report.' (Footnotes omitted) 38 Pursuant to subs 106K(3), the Minister made Health Insurance (Professional Services Review Sampling Methodology) Determination 2000 (No. 1) ('the Sampling Determination'), which provides, inter alia : ' Part 1 Preliminary 1 ... 2 ... 3 Purpose This Determination specifies the content and form of a sampling methodology that may be used by a Committee in making findings for an adjudicative referral. 4 Application (1) This Determination applies if the Committee decides, in respect of conduct in connection with rendering or initiating the services included in a particular class of the referred services, to have regard only to a sample of the services included in the class. (2) The sampling methodology in Part 2 applies to: (a) individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of services; and (b) individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of patients. 5 Definitions In this Determination: Act means the Health Insurance Act 1973 . class size , in relation to a sample, means the number of services rendered or initiated in the particular class of referred services from which a sample is chosen. exploratory sample has the meaning given in section 8. final random sample has the meaning given in section 10. preliminary random sample has the meaning given in section 6. Note 1 The following terms that are used in this Determination are defined in subsection 3 (1) of the Act: &#8226; Initiate &#8226; Patient. ... Part 2 Sampling methodology 6 Preliminary random sample In having regard, under subsection 106K (1) of the Act, only to a sample of the services included in a particular class of referred services, a Committee must ensure that the sample (the preliminary random sample ) is a random sample. 7 Appropriate sample size (1) The preliminary random sample must be of an appropriate sample size to enable prediction with 95% confidence that the percentage of services constituting inappropriate practice worked out from the sample is within +/- 10% of the actual percentage of inappropriate services rendered or initiated in the class of referred services sampled, at a hypothesised incidence of inappropriate practice of 50% of services rendered or initiated (the incidence requiring the largest sample). (2) For a class of services specified in a referral, the appropriate sample size of the preliminary random sample is at least: N __________ 1+0.01(N-1) where: N = class size. (3) If the appropriate sample size worked out is not a whole number, it must be rounded up to the next whole number. 8 Exploratory sample In making a finding based on statistical sampling, the Committee must: (a) examine a sample, preferably of 30 or more services (but not less than 25 services) (the exploratory sample ) , randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample; and (b) determine whether or not each of those services constitutes inappropriate practice. 9 Percentage of inappropriate practice in exploratory sample (1) After the Committee has determined which of the services in an exploratory sample constitute inappropriate practice, it must work out the percentage of services in the sample that constitutes inappropriate practice. (2) The percentage must be expressed as a whole number (being, if necessary, rounded down to the nearest whole number). 10 ...' 39 Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of ground 8 as pleaded are not in issue. Paragraph (d) contains the first allegation of error. Dr Mathews contends that the terms of s 6 of the Sampling Determination, in particular the words 'must ensure', when used in relation to the words 'that the sample (the preliminary random sample) is a random sample', effectively requires the Committee to undertake the sampling itself. Alternatively, it is said that if s 6 does not require the Committee to do the sampling itself, it requires the Committee to ensure for itself that a sample of the services, included in a particular class of selected services, is a random sample and that this cannot be satisfied where the Committee merely relies on a list of services of a particular class, derived from a larger list of services of that particular class, 'fed' to them by the Director, even if the Committee has no reason to think that the larger list of services of that particular class is not a random sample. 40 The primary submission can be rejected out of hand. On no construction of s 6 of the Sampling Determination can it be said that it requires the sampling to be carried out by the Committee itself."
cited,Storm Financial Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1991,"administrators report that the company, prior to its being placed in administration, had instituted proceedings in this Court against the Commonwealth Bank. The nature of those proceedings is described fully in a judgment delivered by Greenwood J, Storm Financial Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1991. An application was made in those proceedings for interlocutory injunctive relief as against the bank. His Honour, for the reasons that he gave on 24 December 2008, refused that application. The substantive proceedings remain on foot. In summary, the proceedings might be described as a claim for damages in respect of alleged contraventions of s 1041E and s 1041H of the Act by the bank in the despatch of correspondence to, and other communications with, clients of Storm Financial earlier in December 2008, which are said to contain false, misleading or deceptive statements. Following adjournments, the application for leave to appeal in respect of the interlocutory injunctive aspect of the proceeding is to be heard in this Court on 6 March 2009. The administrators report that they are presently in the process of seeking to form a view as to the prospects in respect of the substantive proceeding in the court. The position at the moment is that the administrators have not yet obtained legal advice on that subject. That is a matter that they are pursuing actively. The administrators also report, by way of Mr Worrell's affidavit, claims made by investors and clients and media coverage concerning the same and the prospect of the same. They are not yet in a position to give any further assistance to the Court or creditors concerning those claims. The administrators have already travelled to Townsville and undertaken considerable investigative work with Storm Financial's two chief financial officers, and also with the directors of Storm Financial. On 12 January 2009, in the exercise of the judgment consigned to them as administrators, the administrators determined to close Storm Financial's business. In so doing, they were sensitive to the effects such a course had on the employees. The administrators report that, though unpleasant, the decision was one which, having regard to the financial information that they had obtained, was necessary; indeed, it seems, almost inevitable."
cited,Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR 1,"A ringtone is a fragment of a musical work in digital form which is intended to be delivered to and to function as the ring of a mobile telephone: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR 1 at 3 [9] per Lindgren P. The President found that in storing ringtones on its computers, a ringtone supplier makes a reproduction of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones for the purposes of s 31(1)(a)(i) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). In electronically transmitting ringtones to a mobile telephone, the ringtone supplier exercises the right of communication to the public in respect of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones (s 31(1)(a)(iv) of the Act: s 10(1) contains a definition of the word 'communicate' as meaning to 'make available online or electronically transmit ... a work or other subject matter'). By providing an IVR service, a ringtone supplier authorizes the making of the copy of the ringtones which are created in the customer's mobile telephones upon electronic transmission of them (for the purposes of s 36 of the Act) (175 FLR at 4 [11]-[13]). 14 Relevantly, each of the SMS licences dated 1 January 2005 is in identical terms, except for the fees payable under Schedule 1, the identity of the licensors and an extra clause in the AMCOS version regulating reproduction of musical works (cl 5). Each SMS licence commenced on 1 October 2004 (cl 3). APRA was entitled to a fee for monophonic or polyphonic format ringtones of 1.1% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 1.65cents (inclusive of GST) per sale. The fee for phonographic format (i.e. MP3) ringtones was 2.2% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of $3.30 per sale. At all times, Monster charged consumers, according to its advertisements $3.50 per ringtone downloaded via an SMS service. 15 AMCOS was entitled to a fixation fee of $11 in respect of each new AMCOS work added to the licensee's inventory in the quarter for which the fees were payable. In addition, the licensee had to pay AMCOS a fee for each ringtone of 11% inclusive of GST of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 16.5cents (inclusive of GST) per sale. 149 I am of opinion that no such order should be made. Monster has committed serious breaches of the IVR and SMS licences in the past. I do not think that it is appropriate to force APRA and AMCOS into a contractual relationship in the circumstances. I am not satisfied that they would not negotiate the granting of new licences to Monster in good faith. If Monster cannot obtain in such negotiations new licences from APRA, the Copyright Tribunal has power to settle their terms. That power may also extend to the AMCOS licences in circumstances such as the present: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR at 8-9 [26]-[31] per Lindgren P. 150 Monster was unlicensed from 18 August 2005 in respect of IVR services and from 13 December in respect of SMS services. It is liable to APRA and AMCOS for damages for infringement. APRA and AMCOS exercised their election to claim damages rather than an account of profits. It is agreed that the appropriate sum by which compensatory damages should be fixed is what would have been payable under the licences had Monster been licensed. That is a reasonable approach and I will adopt it. 151 Mr Mallett identified four licensees of ringtones from APRA and AMCOS which he said were comparable to the business operated by Monster. The trading names of the licensees were Jamster, Bugal, Blue Sky Frog and Powercom. He concluded that the proportions of ringtone downloads of all downloads in each of those competitors' businesses over the periods he examined were between 40.94% and 66.17%. This was based on the amount of licence fees paid to APRA and AMCOS by each of those licensees during the relevant licence periods. Mr Mallett estimated, based on his comparison with the four competitors, about 41.31% of Monster's revenue over its period of trading was attributable to ringtone services. This led to a claim that total licence fees due to 30 June 2006 were $1 million of which only about $315,000 had been paid."
affirmed,MZXCV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 836,
affirmed,Byrne v Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 416,"A coronial inquiry found that Mr Byrne had died in a ' tragic accident ' and that the cause of his death was drowning. That conclusion was adopted by the Repatriation Commission, which refused Mrs Byrne's claim for a pension, upon being satisfied that the veteran's death was not service related. The Veterans' Review Board affirmed the Commission's decision, which was later affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( Byrne v Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 416). Mrs Byrne appeals the Tribunal's decision. 3 Mrs Byrne put to the Tribunal that her husband suffered from ischaemic heart disease ('IHD') and coronary artery disease ('CAD'), each said to be war-caused conditions. It was accepted by the Tribunal that Mr Byrne did suffer from CAD (at [66]). The issue in this appeal concerns the Tribunal's finding that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that CAD was not a contributing factor to the death of Mr Byrne by drowning. Two grounds of appeal are pressed. The Tribunal's finding that it was not satisfied that Mr Byrne suffered from IHD is not challenged and those parts of the notice of appeal which refer to IHD are not pressed. It is convenient to deal with the second ground of appeal first."
applied,Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 ,"The inference that the evidence of the individual respondents would not have assisted their respective cases is available Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 312 and 321 . There is now a plethora of cases explaining the context of that inference in various ways. It may be accepted that it does not provide positive evidence to fill a gap in the ACCC's case. However, it may strengthen an inference otherwise available on the evidence or, to put it another way, may make a court more comfortable in drawing such an inference. Of course, the inference has particular application where positive evidence is not challenged. I should add that I do not propose to act upon any inference arising out of the answers to, or the failure to answer, interrogatories in relation to Nicholas Yates or Nicholas Rhodin. 58 I do not accept the argument that there is any special standard of proof beyond the balance of probabilities applicable to this proceeding."
cited,Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700,"Perusal of the original Defence supported the respondents' claim that they conceded liability inadvertently: compare Defence, par 8.

If the respondents were granted the leave they sought, no injustice would be done the applicants that could not be remedied by an award of costs in their favour."
affirmed,"Budd v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] AATA 137","Ms Budd applied to the Tribunal for a review of the SSAT decision and participated in a hearing before the Tribunal by way of telephone. The Tribunal delivered its decision on 21 February 2008 affirming the SSAT decision and dismissing Ms Budd's application: see Budd v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] AATA 137. In such decision the Tribunal at [8] made the following finding of fact: She seldom goes out of the house and will only do so to get stationary [sic] supplies and post letters. That is the extent of her travelling. Ms Budd also stated in her letter dated 26 November 2006 that she does not leave the house to do her voluntary work and instead writes the poems at home and then sends them to St Clare's Church. In a letter, undated but received by the Tribunal on 5 November 2007, Ms Budd stated that ""St Clare's does not need me to do ""face to face"" work"". 15 The Tribunal concluded at [9]: I find that Ms Budd does not satisfy the travel test because the nature of her voluntary work does not require her to travel to and from her home for the purpose of undertaking that work. Ms Budd is able to conduct her voluntary work from home. In making my finding I have taken into consideration the reports of Dr Hugo Rodriguez, the letters from Sister Francis, the letter from Senator John Faulkner and several letters that Ms Budd sent the Tribunal. 16 Where a notice of appeal is not filed within the time limits prescribed by s 44(2A)(a) of the AAT Act, s 44(2B) thereof provides: In the interest of justice, the grounds on which the Federal Court of Australia may allow further time under paragraph (2A)(a) include, but are not limited to, the following grounds: (a) if the Tribunal made an oral statement as to the reasons for the decision and afterwards gave a written statement of reasons for the decision--the written statement contains reasons that were not mentioned in the oral statement; (b) the text of the decision or a statement of reasons for the decision has been altered under section 43AA."
cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507,"The respondents observe that the power conferred under s 77EA is necessarily very broad. It is plainly intended that government policy can be taken into account: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 42 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at 529. A new Minister must be free to develop and change government policy, even if that means that weapons that were in the past generally available for importation and sale may now be detained. The respondents refer in that regard to Hot Holdings Pty Limited v Creasy [2002] HCA 51 ; (2002) 210 CLR 438 at 455, where Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ referred with approval to Professor Wade's statement that the whole object of a statutory provision placing a power into the hands of the Minister ""is that he may exercise it according to government policy""."

That conclusion was not inconsistent with the proposition that even though it is the subjective mental state of a person that is to be attributed, objective evidence about the likely effect of the person's conduct may be the best evidence. The statements of parties about their purposes will often be treated with reserve: Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 109; ASX Operations Pty Ltd v Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd (No 1) (1990) 27 FCR 460 at 483."
cited,WAEJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 188 ; (2003) 76 ALD 597,The appellant contends that Smith FM erred in this finding and that the appellant's manner could have been ascertained by his Honour examining the transcript and listening to the tapes. The appellant points to several authorities that caution against findings made by reference to demeanour alone: State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (In liq) (1999) 160 ALR 583 per Kirby J at [88]; WAEJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 188 ; (2003) 76 ALD 597 at [17] [18] referring to SAAK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 367 ; (2002) 121 FCR 185 at [21] [31].
referred to,Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720,"It has been said that s 31A lowers the bar in terms of summary judgment applications. The operation of s 31A was considered by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720. I do not think it necessary to enter into the interesting questions of what the particular standard imposed by the new version of s 31A might be. This is because whatever the bar is, the current applications pass well beneath it. That is, I find that they are, despite their creativity, devoid of merit. It follows, in my opinion, that there should be orders under s 31A. That makes it unnecessary for me to consider the operation of Order 20 rule 5 or to consider the operation of Order 11 rule 16 in so far as the statement of claim is concerned. 40 Mr Gargan argued that s 31A was constitutionally invalid. Normally s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) would impose upon this Court an obligation not to proceed to deal with Mr Gargan's constitutional argument without adjourning the proceeding in order to allow the various Attorneys-General for the States and of the Commonwealth a chance to intervene. However, s 78B operates on constitutional matters. I do not think that a constitutional argument which is completely devoid of merit amounts to a constitutional matter within the meaning of those provisions. To make good that point, it is necessary to take account of what the argument is. 41 The argument is that s 31A operates to ""dictate"" to the Federal Court what the outcome of the case is. There may well have been an issue if s 31A had commanded the Court to dismiss a proceeding which had any of the qualities described in s 31A(1)(a) or (b). However, the plain text of s 31A is that the Court ""may"" give judgment. There is simply no room to argue whatever that s 31A operates as a dictation. Accordingly I reject that argument. The necessary consequence is that there must, on both notices of motion, be judgment for the first and second respondents under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)."
cited,University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1,"While the Court must take these matters into account, they are not the only matters that may be taken into account: Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 at [13] per Branson J; [135] per Kenny J, French J agreeing (concerning the construction and application of s 101(1A) of the Act which corresponds in terms to s 36(1A), in the context of infringement of copyright in sound recordings, films and the like). Both these sections are premised on the concept of ""authorisation"" developed by the High Court in University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1; Cooper at [136]. The word ""authorise"" in the cases has been given its dictionary meaning of ""sanction, approve or countenance"": Falcon v Famous Players Film Company [1926] 2 KB 474; Adelaide City Corporation v Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd [1928] HCA 10 ; (1928) 40 CLR 481; Moorhouse at 12 (Gibbs J), 20-21 (Jacobs J); WEA International Inc v Hanimex Corp Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 274, 285-286 (Gummow J); Cooper at [20] per Branson J, French J agreeing. 267 As the managing director, Palazzesi accepted that Metricon would not have included the Prada 35 in its product line without his approval. This fact, and the fact that Popple and Bugeja were subject to his direction, were said not in themselves to be enough to constitute authorisation by him. It was contended, in my view correctly, that the necessary mental element required to be established: Moorhouse at p 12 per Gibbs CJ. In other words, in this case, it is necessary, in order to render Palazzesi liable, not only that he approved the Alleged Infringing Works but that he did so knowing that they contained a copy of the alfresco quadrant from the Seattle 31. This is not of universal application but it is the way that the case was put by the applicants. 268 Palazzesi did acknowledge in cross-examination that there are similarities between the Prada 35 and the Seattle 31, identifying the position of the two bedrooms, rumpus room, kitchen, dining and family and alfresco. It was said, however, that there is no evidence that Palazzesi knew or appreciated that Prototype 20B, or the Prada 35, were copied from the Seattle 31 plan or home or were so similar that they must have been copied. Palazzesi denied that he had any such appreciation. 269 Palazzesi pointed particularly to a number of matters which he says demonstrate that he had no relevant knowledge: (a) Popple did not tell him that he, Popple, thought Prototype 20B had similarities to the Seattle 31 display; (b) the reference by Jason Biasin to the similarity of the Richmond in Perth to the Seattle 31 was a reference to a fa&ccedil;ade and that there was no reason for him to be thinking about the Seattle 31 at the time they were looking at the Pavillion; (c) he had no special interest in the activities of the applicants between January 2000 when the Seattle 31 display opened, and 2002 when the Prada 35 was designed, and in particular: (i) he was not aware of how many homes were sold by the Barrett Property Group; (ii) he did not think about the Seattle 31 after his brief visit in January 2000 until Stutterd complained to Kline in mid 2003; (iii) while he did hope to keep abreast of the competition, he was not watching the applicants and the pressures on him were to build homes and manage the explosive growth at Metricon; and (iv) he did not know about the applicant's success with the Seattle 31; or how many homes they had sold by February 2002; other than he had heard that ""they were doing OK""; (d) courtyard houses, with the meals, kitchen, family and rumpus areas arranged around an outdoor space were well known and he had involvement with a number of such designs (including both the Simonds Monterey and Seville as well as AV Jennings homes); and (e) the points of reference for the alfresco feature or concept were what he (and the others) had seen on the Perth trip."
referred to,Provan v HCL Real Estate Ltd (1992) 24 ATR 238,"If the Commissioner's contentions in the present proceedings are correct, SRSC may find itself in the position of having to pay income tax on a damages award already reduced to take account of its notional income tax liability. Perhaps more significantly, this Court would have reached a conclusion inconsistent with that reached by the Supreme Court in a judgment that has not been the subject of an appeal. Courts have adverted to this problem on other occasions and suggested that it should be open to join the Commissioner as a party in proceedings in which damages are to be assessed: Gill v Australian Wheat Board [1980] 2 NSWLR 795, at 797, per Rogers J; Provan v HCL Real Estate Ltd (1992) 24 ATR 238 , at 247, per Rolfe J. This case may be a further illustration of the need to consider procedural changes designed to enable a court to determine the impact of taxation on a damages award once and for all and to encourage the parties to take steps in an appropriate case to ensure that this is done."
followed,Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71,"The first question, that is, whether the defect or irregularity is formal, involves two levels of enquiry. These were stated by an earlier decision of the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71, and applied in Adams at [25]ff. 31 The relevant enquiry is: does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations; or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice; see Kleinwort Benson at 79; Adams at [25]."
referred to,Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517,"respondent said that given the power to administer an oath or affirmation (s 52(4)), the fact that the obligation to answer questions is subject to only limited excuses (s 52(6) and s 53) and the right to legal representation (s 52(3)) a power in the ABC Commissioner to regulate and control an examination must be implied. That conclusion was, said the respondent, supported by the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517 (' Bell '). In Bell , an inspector was conducting an examination in the course of an investigation by the Australian Securities Commission ('the Commission') and he made an order that an examinee not be represented by a particular legal practitioner. The order was made on the basis that the legal practitioner had appeared for a number of examinees and the legal practitioner's firm had been involved in the preparation of a prospectus which might be under consideration in the course of the investigation. The Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth) contained provisions to the effect that an examinee may have legal representation (s 23(1)) , that an examination was to be in private (s 22(1)) , that the inspector could determine who was to be present at the examination (s 22(1)) , and provisions dealing with the inspector's powers to control the conduct of a legal representative at an examination (s 23(2)). The decisions in A, B and D and Bell were referred to with approval by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Re Whiting [1994] 1 Qd R 561. A firm of solicitors was acting for a police officer who was the subject of a complaint under the Criminal Justice Act 1989 (Qld) and for three police officers who were witnesses in the proceeding. The Chairman of the Criminal Justice Commission ruled that the same legal representative would not be authorised by the Commission to represent both the potential witnesses and the officer against whom the complaint was made. An application to the Supreme Court challenging the order was dismissed. In Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244, French J followed Bell and in the course of his reasons said (at 254): 'Where one lawyer seeks to represent a number of examinees in the same investigation, it may be thought that there is a risk that without consciously intending any impropriety that lawyer might divulge to one examinee what has passed in the examination of another. The extension of a restriction to all members of a given firm may be controversial: see Wood v National Companies &amp; Securities Commission (1990) 2 WAR 176. However there are matters of judgment and assessment involved. It is of course, not the role of the ASC to supervise the lawyer-client relationships of those who appear before it in s 19 examinations. It is only where a conflict of interest has some actual or potential impact on the investigative process that a direction based on such a concern would be within power.' In Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284, French J considered whether the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ('the Commission') had the power to give a non-disclosure direction and to direct that solicitors who had acted for other persons the Commission might wish to examine be excluded from the applicants' examinations. He followed Bell and his own decision in Stockbridge v Ogilvie (supra) and held that the Commission had both these powers. The statutory provisions in this case are very general. They may be contrasted with the quite detailed provisions under consideration in cases such as A, B and D and Bell . Nevertheless, I think it is clear that the ABC Commissioner must have the power to regulate and control the conduct of proceedings before him. He can determine when and where an examination will be held and, providing a proper basis exists, he can regulate and control how the examination is to proceed and who may be present. He is charged with the function of conducting an investigation into suspected unlawful conduct and may bring proceedings for a civil penalty in relation to that conduct. He must be taken to have by implication the power to make orders or give directions which will ensure the integrity of the investigation and, to a point, its effectiveness. In my opinion, he has the power to exclude a particular legal practitioner from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination. It is appropriate for me to consider whether, insofar as the direction is within power, there was a proper basis to exercise the power. The test as formulated in A, B and D is whether the decision-maker 'concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will, or may, prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out pursuant to the terms of its statute' (at 448). In Bell , Lockhart J said that he favoured a test which presented a slightly higher barrier of 'will or is likely to' prejudice the investigation, although he went on to say that 'the difference in practical application will depend on judicial approach to the facts of the particular case' (at 522). In my respectful opinion, although there is something to be said for a test which presents a slightly higher barrier, the weight of authority is in favour of the test of 'will or may' prejudice the investigation and it is that test which I will apply."
distinguished,McGee v Yeomans [1977] 1 NSWLR 273,"I am of opinion that the commencing words of r 2(1) which I have just quoted demonstrate that the power of the Court in r 2(1), in the ordinary and natural meaning of the rule, must be read as being constrained by matters referred to in the rest of O 13 r 2. These words make O 13 r 2 operate differently to rules such as those considered in cases like McGee v Yeomans [1977] 1 NSWLR 273 at 279G where Glass JA observed that the general power of amendment under the New South Wales rules ( Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) Pt 20 r 1(1)) was not made subject to the other parts of the same rule, and that another part of that rule (SCR Pt 20 r 4(7)) expressly provided that those parts did not limit the general power to allow amendments under SCR Pt 20 r 1(1) (cf: Charles Church Developments Ltd v Stent Foundations Ltd [2007] 1 WLR 1203). 67 That might not be the end of the argument because ASS also pointed to O 13 r 2(2). There is certainly also a plenary character to the grant of power in that rule. But it falls to be considered here, having regard to the question whether the interests of justice operate to allow the filling of a gap which would have the consequence of overcoming an expired limitation period. In that respect, the qualification in the commencing words of O 13 r 2(1) and other parts of the rule in O 13 r 2 are relevant. Order 13 r 2 subrr (3) to (7) deal expressly with applications to the Court for leave to make amendments: &#8226; to correct mistakes in the name or identity of the party; &#8226; to substitute one party for another where such a mistake needs correction; &#8226; to alter the capacity in which a party is said to be suing; or &#8226; to add a new claim for relief or foundation in law for a claim for relief provided that it arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as those already pleaded to support an existing claim for relief by the party applying for the amendment. 68 Each of those subrules and the framing of subr (3) in itself evince an intention to allow the correction of mistakes or the addition of a legal formulation of a claim for relief, but not to add previously omitted material facts necessary to complete the pleading of an existing cause of action. And subr (9) expressly provides that an amendment would not be permitted which would have an effect inconsistent with a statute of limitation in matters arising under subrr (7)(b) and (8)."

cited,Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423,"Conde commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court to have the bankruptcy notice set aside and interim orders granting an extension of time for him to comply with the bankruptcy notice. The matter came before Wilson FM, who dismissed the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice ( Conde v Hunter [2009] FMCA 751). In his reasons for decision, his Honour found in summary as follows: Mr Conde made no attack on the form of the bankruptcy notice itself. Although Mr Conde contended that Mr Hunter did not have a final judgment or final order (the execution of which had not been stayed in terms of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("" Bankruptcy Act "")) the argument was misconceived. His Honour continued: A final order is one that disposes finally of an issue between the parties. The concept of what is a final order is discussed in cases such as Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423. In this case, the issue was who should pay the costs of the application to set aside the applicant's pleading. The order made by Judge Searles was a final order, insofar as it concerned that issue. His Honour ordered that the applicant pay the respondent's costs. There is no merit in the first ground sought to be advanced by the applicant. (at [3]) Notwithstanding Mr Conde's prospective challenge to Orders 3 and 4 of Searles DCJ, it was clear on the material before his Honour that: because the order sought to be challenged on appeal was only as to costs, leave to appeal was required by the Court of Appeal; the application for leave to appeal was filed many months out of time and therefore required an order from the Court of Appeal granting an extension of time. The Federal Magistrate noted that no contest had been made against the Orders 1 and 2 made by Searles DCJ, namely to strike out Mr Conde's amended statement of claim and give leave to Mr Conde to replead in that Court. The Federal Magistrate considered that, in those circumstances and having read Mr Conde's application to the Court of Appeal and supporting affidavit, that application to the Court of Appeal has no prospects of success. It followed that no good reason was shown for either setting aside the bankruptcy notice or extending time for compliance with it to await the outcome in the Queensland Court of Appeal. Accordingly the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice. Appeal from decision of the Federal Magistrate In this context a ""final order"" is an order which ""finally disposes of the rights of the parties"": Bozson v Altrincham Urban District Council [1903] 1 KB 547 at 548-549, Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 per Taylor J at 439-440 (Owen J concurring), Windeyer J at 443-444; Licul v Corney [1976] HCA 6 ; (1976) 50 ALJR 439 at 444; Carr v Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd (No 1) [1981] HCA 20 ; (1981) 147 CLR 246 at 253-254. It is clear however that an order may in one sense be interlocutory but in another sense final: re Black ex parte Jeffery (1932) 4 ABC 157 at 161. There is long-standing authority that a costs order made at an interlocutory stage during proceedings is nonetheless a final order for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act : re Black ex parte Jeffery (1932) 4 ABC 157 , re McAlister ex parte McAlister (1936) 8 ABC 283 , Kayo Contractors v Fernandez (1984) 71 FLR 34 and Re Gibbs; Ex parte Triscott (1995) 65 FCR 80.

The time for compliance has statutory significance. The recipient is obliged to furnish the information sought within the time specified in the notice, and must produce the documents sought in accordance with the notice: subs 155(1). It is an offence to fail to comply: subs 155(5) and (6A). These are matters that needed to be considered by Mr Samuel, as they undoubtedly were, as part of the statutory context of issuing the Notices and as part of the consequences of non-compliance. Once one reaches the conclusion that the decision to issue the Notices was exercised with care, took into account the relevant considerations, and was not to be impugned on the basis of the principles in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 , then the reference to the statutory significance of compliance takes the argument no further."

Leave to amend to raise a new ground may be refused where the new ground requires additional evidence to be adduced.

Even had the "" main application "" been considered, it is not considered that there is any real prospect that the outcome would have been any different. Any real prospect of success would depend upon rejecting the account given by the Tribunal. There was no transcript of the Tribunal proceedings available before the Federal Magistrate and, in the absence of a transcript, it is unlikely that the account given by the Tribunal would have been rejected by that Court or, for that matter, this Court. 20 A further issue which at one stage arose for resolution was the fate of the Appellant husband's application. Had this issue been pursued, questions would have arisen as to whether the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrates Court should have entertained that application, being an application advanced by the husband for the first time before the Tribunal."

cited,SZLWE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1343,"SZLWE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1343 , Perram J reviewed some of these different outcomes as follows: [19] It is then useful to say something about the Tribunal's confusion of the Appellant's membership of the Lebanese forces with membership of the Lebanese Armed Forces. In the Appellant's amended application to the Federal Magistrates Court such a claim was expressly included. However, at the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court the Appellant, who was represented by counsel, abandoned that argument. There may be some circumstances in which an appellate court will permit a party who has expressly abandoned a point at trial to raise it afresh on appeal. Gyles J would have permitted such a course in Dovuro v Wilkins [2000] FCA 1902 ; (2000) 105 FCR 476 at 527 [181] at least where the point involved no prejudice to the other party. Branson and Finkelstein JJ took the opposite view: 487 488 [38] and 508 509 [119] [120]. There may be something to be said for the view that where a point is expressly abandoned that the doctrine of waiver is relevant to the question: cf. Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67 at 75 per Lord Halsbury, 80 per Lord Bowen; applied by the Privy Council in Yorkshire Insurance Co v Craine [1922] 2 AC 541 at 552 553 per Lords Buckmaster, Atkinson, Sumner, Parmoor and Wrenbury. If that were so, the question of whether an appellate court should entertain a fresh ground might not be relevant &#8212; there might be no ground to raise. However, whether the question is posed as one about the circumstances in which an appellate court should permit a point abandoned below to be resurrected on appeal, or, instead, one of waiver leading to the conclusion that the point no longer juridically exists &#8212; the outcome is the same in this case. I would not permit the abandoned ground to be entertained. It is not necessary in the present appeal to pursue His Honour's views as to the possible application of the doctrine of waiver."
cited,Hook v Rolfe (1986) 7 NSWLR 40,"A similar position was adopted in Hook v Rolfe (1986) 7 NSWLR 40 per Hope, Glass and Samuels JJA at pp 44 and 45. In Secretary to The Department of Treasury and Finance v Dalla-Riva [2007] VSCA 11 , Buchanan JA with whom Ashley JA and Smith AJA agreed considered the construction to be given to a provision which said, 'a document is an exempt document if it is (b) a document that has been prepared by a Minister or on his or her behalf or by an agency for the purpose of submission for consideration by the Cabinet; (ba) a document prepared for the purpose of briefing a Minister in relation to issues to be considered by the Cabinet' (s 28(1) Freedom of Information Act 1982 ). At [13], Buchanan JA said this: The purpose identified in the relevant paragraph of s 28(1) may be the dominant purpose or one of a number of significantly contributing purposes. Notwithstanding that the objects of the Act set out in s 3 appear to me to warrant construing the rights conferred by the Act liberally and the exceptions narrowly, in my view as long as a purpose meeting the statutory description was causative in the sense that but for its presence, ""the power would not have been exercised"" it need not have been the sole purpose for the preparation of the document in question.

cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR 41-851,"Full Court in Mobil Oil made the following further five points: &#8226; First, the rationale for giving weight to a joint submission on penalty is the saving in resources for the regulator and the Court, which, in the case of the regulator, can be used to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the Court. &#8226; Second, the sixth proposition from NW Frozen Foods (see [26] above) does not mean that the Court must commence its reasoning with the level of penalty proposed and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range: the Court may, instead, address the question independently at the outset. &#8226; Third, there was no suggestion in NW Frozen Foods that the admissions or statement of agreed facts had been ""tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the [Commission] in proving its case"" (at [55]). &#8226; Fourth, the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning said to justify a discounted penalty (the Court referred to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR 41-851 at [56]). &#8226; Fifth, there is nothing in NW Frozen Foods inconsistent with any of the following propositions: (i) The Court may request the parties to provide additional evidence or information or to verify the information provided, in default of which the Court may well not be satisfied that the proposed penalty is within the permissible range; (ii) If the absence of a contradictor inhibits the Court in the performance of its duty under s 76 of the Act, it may seek the assistance of an amicus curiae or of an individual or body prepared to act or intervene under O 6 r 17 of the Federal Court Rules ; and (iii) If the Court is disposed not to impose the agreed penalty, it may be appropriate for the parties or either of them to be given the opportunity to withdraw consent and for the matter to proceed as a contested hearing."
referred to,National Australia Bank Ltd v Norman [2009] FCAFC 152,"referred the parties to the more recent decision of the Full Court in National Australia Bank Ltd v Norman [2009] FCAFC 152 delivered on 30 October 2009, on which the parties also made submissions. I do not propose to embark upon a detailed consideration of the various elements of an MIS as defined in s 9 of the Act. It suffices to say that I do not think that either of the authorities named above or others to which I was referred demonstrate conclusively that the arrangement in the present case was or was not an MIS. Both possibilities are arguable. It seems to me that for the purpose of this application for urgent interim relief, I should proceed on the assumptions that arguably funds have been and are to be raised under an unlawful MIS and that arguably the assignments are invalid and HPM lacks title to them. In his submissions, counsel for HPM has stated in a different connection that neither TROM nor Merilbah has any assets from which to pay damages and that TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators are not a source of recovery. I infer that unless the funds already raised from investor-debtors are made available, the question of the validity of the assignments will not be able to tested. TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators are officers of the Court. So far as the evidence reveals, no investor-debtor who has provided funding or been asked to provide it is complaining. I appreciate that it can be said that the investor-debtors would not be aware of circumstances giving them a right to complain. For example, apparently they would not know that HOL has misrepresented to them that if the assignments are held to be invalid, they will definitely obtain a discharge of their debts. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is aware of the present dispute but has not sought an injunction restraining the defendants from approaching the investor-debtors. Several questions of concern are raised by the present application for interim relief. Who are the creditors (including, but not limited to, contingent creditors) of TROM and Merilbah who will benefit from a determination that the assignments are invalid? What is the ground of their status as creditors or contingent creditors? What is the fund that it is hoped will provide the basis of a distribution to creditors? Have TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators been encouraging investor-debtors to make claims and thereby to become contingent creditors? How can TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators support a result that all investor-debtors be released from their debts? Has there been an abuse by TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators of their powers in seeking to create challenges to the validity of the assignments in circumstances in which, if it be the case, the only persons who will benefit in terms of payment of money will be themselves?"

referred to,"Groth v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1995) 40 ALD 541","The Tribunal member referred to two authorities which had considered the nature of this discretion. He referred to Re Krzywak v Secretary to the Department of Social Security (AAT 4614, 9 September 1988) and Groth v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1995) 40 ALD 541. The Tribunal member said that, in the appellant's circumstances, the consequence of the compensation legislation was as intended, that is to say, that neither the appellant nor Mrs Ilba should retain compensation and compensation effected Centrelink payments. He noted that the appellant argued that in some way Centrelink had foregone its right to retain the recovered moneys through what he considered to be Centrelink's harassment of himself. The Tribunal member said that on the evidence before him he was unable to conclude that the appellant had been harassed by Centrelink, but he said that in any event, he considered that any such harassment was unrelated to Centrelink's decisions in 1989, that is at least 14 years prior to the date the appellant suggested his harassment by Centrelink commenced. For these reasons, the Tribunal decided that the decision under review should be affirmed. 13 Leaving aside the need to identify a question of law I do not think it is arguable that there were special circumstances such that the respondent's power was enlivened. The operation of the recovery provisions did not produce anything unfair, unintended or unjust in the relevant sense (see Groth v Secretary, Department of Social Security (supra) at 545). In fact, I did not understand the appellant to put his case in this way. His complaint was that some time after the respondent's predecessor had decided to recover the relevant amount, he had been harassed by the respondent's predecessor and that this harassment was a sufficient basis for an order that the amount recovered be repaid to him. The acts constituting the alleged harassment were not identified by the appellant. Even if they had been, harassment some time after the recovery of the money by the respondent could not constitute special circumstances within the provisions of s 156 of the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth) or s 1184K of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth). In my opinion, the appeal is clearly unarguable and it is an appropriate case for me to exercise the power in O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules . 14 The appeal is dismissed.

referred to,Re Steelmaster Pty Ltd (in liq ) (1992) 6 ACSR 494,"At [54], his Honour observed that the reported cases establish that the Court will not make an order which is futile, as where the reinstated company would be left without the funding necessary to permit the liquidator to do any work. His Honour noted that in Re Steelmaster Pty Ltd (in liq ) (1992) 6 ACSR 494, the Court made an order, albeit by consent, for the applicant for reinstatement to pay the costs and disbursements of the liquidator incurred as a result of the reinstatement, including the costs of any further proceedings under s 509 of the Corporations Law. 82 The payments by way of return of capital and interim dividend of November 2001 were made to JHFBV, a corporation that no longer exists. The second return of capital, that of September 2003, was to JHIFBV, a company which, so far as the evidence shows, still exists. The second return of capital, however, was in a sum of only $7,608,773 a small fraction of the amount exceeding $150,000,000 which is expected to be the amount of the tax and shortfall penalties (see [46] above). 83 The Commissioner refers to the fact that the two capital reductions divested JHAF of all of its assets, and that the second of them took place in contemplation of the winding up which was resolved upon the following day.

considered,General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125,"It was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that the jurisprudence which has developed in this Court in relation to the striking out under s 84C of the Native Title Act of an application on the basis of a failure to comply with the requirements of that Act was relevant by analogy to the dismissal of an application pursuant to s 190F(6). That jurisprudence, of which Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 and Bodney v Brophy [2004] FCAFC 226 are exemplars at intermediate appellate level, evidences an application in the particular context of the dismissal of a native title application, of the reticence which customarily attends the summary dismissal of a proceeding under a rule such as, in this Court, O 20 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules , having regard to root authorities on the subject such as General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130 and Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioner [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91. 50 Part 7 was inserted into the Native Title Act by the 1998 Amendment Act . In Donnelly for The Wahlabul People v Registrar National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1330 at [6] , Hely J remarked of the claim registration regime introduced by Pt 7 that: 6 The registration test is not a screening mechanism for access to the Federal Court. A claim which is not registered may proceed to determination in the Court. But when a claim is on the Register the applicants are afforded significant procedural rights, including the right to be consulted upon, or to comment, on specific classes of future acts, and the right to negotiate over the grant of mining tenements or compulsory acquisition of the land. Given those statutory benefits, the purpose of the registration test is to ensure that only those claims with merit are registered. Strictly, even after the amendments made by the Technical Amendments Act , it remains true that the registration test found in Pt 7 is ""not a screening mechanism for access to the Federal Court"" (my emphasis). That is so if for no other reason than that satisfaction of the registration test is not a condition precedent to the ability to file in the Court an application for determination of a native title claim. However, the presence now of s 190F(6) in the Native Title Act and the particular occasion for its engagement provided by s 190F(5) does indicate that satisfaction of the registration test has ramifications for whether an application should be allowed to remain on the Court's list. Further, given that the Act confers the choice of a full right of review by the Court of the registration refusal decision and vests in the Court a discretion as to whether the application should be dismissed, that the registration decision is initially made by an administrative official is not indicative of an impermissible interference by the Executive with the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. It is s 190F(6) which provides the ""screening mechanism""."

referred to,Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Ltd (1977) 1B IPR 665,"Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Ltd (1977) 1B IPR 665 ( Beecham) , the plaintiff alleged infringement of patents for a pharmaceutical compound by the importation, offering for sale and sale in the United Kingdom of the antibiotic, Hetacillin. The plaintiff held four patents relating to a new class of semi-synthetic penicillins and to methods for their manufacture. One such penicillin was Ampicillin, a valuable antibiotic. The clinical effectiveness of Hetacillin was due entirely to Ampicillin, of which it was an acetone derivative. In the presence of water, as and when administered as an antibiotic, Hetacillin would revert into Ampicillin by a reversible chemical reaction. The Lundbecks rely on a passage from the speech of Lord Diplock, the whole of the paragraph being as follows (p 710): I have already expressed my opinion that the pith and marrow doctrine is applicable to claims for new products as well as to new processes; and I agree with the Court of Appeal that the relationship of hetacillin to ampicillin provides a clear case for its application. It was argued that what is claimed in the patents as an essential feature of the class of products to which ampicillin belongs is the presence of an amino group in the alpha position, and that this feature is absent in hetacillin. This is literally true at the time of importation and sale but it ceases to be true as soon as hetacillin is put to use for the only purpose for which it is intended. The substitution for the postulated amino group of the variant incorporated in hetacillin is evanescent and reversible and for all practical purposes of use can be regarded as the equivalent of the amino group in ampicillin. In the apt phrase used by the Court of Appeal, it is the reproduction of the substance ampicillin, albeit temporarily masked. His Lordship was addressing a product claim. In the imported hetacillin, there was a substituent for the amino group in the alpha position, but the substitution of the variant was ""evanescent and reversible"" and could be regarded as the equivalent of the amino group in the alpha position in the patented drug ampicillin. The Lundbecks draw an analogy with the bromo-diol's performance of the function of the cyano-diol. Wootten J was of the view (at 532) that a proper and convenient way to test the matter was to ask whether the sale of monensin sodium in Australia by another person would be an infringement of the patent. After referring to Beecham , his Honour held (at 534) that ""the mere conversion of monensic acid to monensin sodium with the retention of substantially the same molecular structure and the same therapeutic effects, and involving only the use of a simple and well understood process, would fall within the 'pith and marrow' doctrine""."

considered,Condren; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) v R [1991] 1 Qd R 574,"insight into the subject matter, scope and purpose of s 672A(a) is offered by another Queensland Court of Appeal decision, R v Daley; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) [2005] QCA 162 , and by earlier Queensland authorities concerning that section referred to by Keane JA, who delivered the principal judgment in that case (Williams and Muir JJA agreeing). His Honour observed: It may be said that this new evidence might have been obtained with reasonable diligence prior to trial so that it would not satisfy the test for the admission of ""fresh evidence"" enunciated in Ratten v. The Queen [1974] HCA 35 ; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516, 517. However that may be, it seems that on a reference under Section 672A, the Court has a broader discretion to ensure that justice is done and is seen to be done. See The Queen v. Young (No 2) [1969] Qd R 566 ; The Queen v. Condren Ex Parte Attorney-General [1991] 1 Qd R 574 at 578, 579. ... [The] issue was not whether Mr Daley's legal representation was incompetent. The issue is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. See TKWJ v. The Queen (2002) 202 CLR 124; Ali v. The Queen [2005] HCA 8 ; (2005) 214 ALR 1. It is one thing to set aside a conviction upon such a reference applying this test but, having done so, quite another to order the entry of a verdict of acquittal, as opposed to ordering a new trial. To order the former is to usurp a function ordinarily consigned to a jury under our system of criminal justice in respect of offences prosecuted on indictment. A discretion exists, but ordinarily an appellate court would exercise it against the entry of a verdict of acquittal unless it had held that the case considered as a whole required a jury to acquit the appellant because it must entertain a reasonable doubt or that a conviction would necessarily be unsafe: Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45 ; (2002) 210 CLR 285 at 297, [23] per Gaudron and Hayne J and at 331, [134] per Callinan J, cf at 316-317, [86]-[90] per Kirby J; see also Condren; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) v R [1991] 1 Qd R 574 at 577 per Kelly SPJ and at 591 per Dowsett J, cf at 585-588 per Thomas J."
applied,Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 18 ; (2000) 200 CLR 121,"The applicant submitted that the issues in the case were within the knowledge of the taxation officers and that their failure to give evidence gave rise to the inference that their evidence would not have assisted the Commissioner. He relied on Kordan Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1807 at [47] to [51] and Weissensteiner v The Queen [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 225-229. This reliance on Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 is misplaced. As the Court said in that case at [48]: ""the rule, however expressed, does not permit an inference to be drawn by reason of the failure of the other side to call a witness where that inference is not otherwise open. Put another way, the failure to call evidence does not provide positive evidence, nor does it fill up any gap in the evidence."" In Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 18 ; (2000) 200 CLR 121 at 143 Gleeson CJ and McHugh J approved a passage from the 6 th Australian edition of Cross on Evidence : ""The rule [in Jones v Dunkel] only applies where a party is 'required to explain or contradict' something. What a party is required to explain or contradict depends on the issues in the case as thrown up in the pleadings and by the course of evidence in the case. No inference can be drawn unless evidence is given of facts 'requiring an answer'."" Their Honours went on: ""A Jones v Dunkel inference can only make certain evidence more probable. It 'cannot be used to make up any deficiency of evidence': Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 312 per Menzies J."" That observation is applicable here."
cited,Stephenson Jordan &amp; Harrison Ltd v MacDonald &amp; Evans (1952) 69 RPC 10,"These expressions of principle concerning rights to relief against third parties are stated at a reasonably high level of abstraction and do not deal 'definitively or comprehensively' with the 'matters' which determine ultimately whether a duty of confidence has devolved upon a third party. The applicant also relies upon what is said to be an applied expression of the principle to a bona fide third party for value in the decisions of Lloyd-Jacob J in Stephenson Jordan &amp; Harrison Ltd v MacDonald &amp; Evans (1951) 68 RPC 190 and the Court of Appeal in Stephenson Jordan &amp; Harrison Ltd v MacDonald &amp; Evans (1952) 69 RPC 10 per Evershed M.R. and Denning and Morris LL.JJ. In that case, Lloyd-Jacob J granted an injunction to restrain a publisher from publishing, pursuant to a contract with the author, a book containing confidential information of the plaintiff concerning the application of principles of business management to particular problems encountered at various functional levels of commercial activity. The publisher struck the contract innocently but once put on notice, prior to publication, of the confidential content incorporated within the work, the jurisdiction to grant an injunction was found by Lloyd-Jacob J to arise on the footing that 'an innocent mind at the time of contract could not overcome the consequences of full knowledge at or before the time [of publication]'. This applied statement of principle was said to derive from Prince Albert v Strange (1849) 1 Mac. &amp; G. 25 and Morison v Moat (1851) 9 Hare 241 at 263. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that the principles of business management reflected in the work were not confidential and in the context of a contention that an injunction will not lie in the absence of some right of property, breach of contract or breach of trust, Evershed M.R. observed at p 16, '... it would be, to my mind somewhat shocking if reputable publishers, who discovered that there was in some work which they had acquired, a gross breach of faith, publication of which would involve the ruin of some business, yet nevertheless could say, having discovered that fact before they had published or incurred any substantial expense that they were entitled to insist on going on with their publication'. Denning LJ at p 22 fully agreed with 'all that [Evershed M.R.] has said on all the issues' and Morris LJ 'at p 23 also fully agreed'."
cited,Lamb v Ariss [2006] FMCA 510,"On 13 April 2006, the Magistrate discharged the mandatory injunction and related orders on the ground that the applicant's solicitor had failed to act with the requisite candour when seeking an order ex parte: see Lamb v Ariss [2006] FMCA 510 (the Magistrate's reasons). 3 The applicant applies for leave to appeal, if it be required, from the discharge of the mandatory injunction. (A notice of appeal has been filed.) The applicant also moves the Court for a stay of the proceeding before the Magistrate pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. 4 Three issues arise for determination by me: (a) whether leave to appeal is required; (b) if leave is required, whether leave should be granted; and (c) if no leave is required or, if leave is required, leave is granted, whether the applicant is entitled to the stay."
applied,"Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Homewood (2006) 91 ALD 103","French J in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Homewood (2006) 91 ALD 103 made the following relevant observations, at 111: [40] The obligations set out in s 43 are not necessarily discharged by merely setting out findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence on which those findings are based and then stating a conclusion. There will always be some legal rule or principle or discretion to apply. It may be that a rule or principle, like the major premise of a syllogism, will embody the factual circumstance necessary to give rise to a right or liability. Then it may be sufficient to state that rule or principle in the reasons, the facts found as the minor premise, the evidence on which they are based and the result which follows. Not all, and perhaps not many results are so easily explained. Whether the reasoning is syllogistic or otherwise, the tribunal will have discharged its duty under s 43 if its reasons disclose its findings of fact, the evidence on which they were based and the logical process by which it moved from those findings to the result in the case. [41] Where a case involves the exercise of a discretion, the tribunal's duty is not discharged by setting out the findings of fact necessary to enliven the relevant discretion. That is so even in a case in which the enlivening facts are of an evaluative character, such as the existence of special circumstances. What must appear from the reasons is why the discretion was exercised in the way it was."

Such a fundamental deficiency in a notice of appeal is not a mere matter of form; no original jurisdiction is vested in this Court to review errors perceived to have been committed by the Tribunal: SZLZM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1263. In Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 210 , Finn, Marshall and Goldberg JJ likewise emphasised the appellate role of this Court. Their Honours were there addressing an appeal which did at least allege error on the part of the Federal Magistrate, but they did go on to make the following observations as to attempts to review in this Court the reasons of the Tribunal: [10] We granted leave at the commencement of the hearing to amend the grounds of appeal better to reflect the written submissions the appellant had filed in the appeal. The two errors now ascribed [to] her Honour's decision are that she failed to find (i) that the Tribunal did not address whether by reason of all of the claims made by the appellant, including those relating to events prior to 1997, the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason; and (ii) that the Tribunal erred in asking whether all Tamils would have such a well-founded fear. We should state at the outset that we do not consider there is substance in either ground. We would add that much of the appellant's submissions were directed to the proposition that the Tribunal had made errors in the way it had considered the evidence and issues before it. Although this occurred under the rubric of a consideration of the primary judge's reasons it was of little assistance in understanding why it was said that the primary judge fell into error. The Court wishes to emphasise that an appeal to the Full Court in a refugee matter should not be taken as an occasion to re-consider the Tribunal's reasons as distinct from considering the primary judge's reasons."
cited,Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Australia Meat Holdings (1998) 82 IR 76,"Before moving to apply these considerations to the facts set out in the Primary Reasons, two further points must be made. First, the Court has a discretion whether or not to impose a penalty: s 719 of the WR Act and see also Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Australia Meat Holdings (1998) 82 IR 76 at 78 and Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union (1999) 91 IR 96 at [33] (which considered the discretion to impose penalty under s 178 of the WR Act prior to substantial amendments to the WR Act in 2005). In other words, there is no principle that a Court must, in all cases of proven breach, impose a penalty: Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union (1999) 91 IR 96 at [33]."

Absence of information will involve a failure to provide necessary details if, without such information, the notice will not fulfil the purpose for which it is required to be given ( Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Woodhams [2000] HCA 10 ; (2000) 199 CLR 370 at [33] ). However, a notice analogous to a notice before action is not intended to serve the purpose of a statement of claim if and when action is taken ( Woodhams at [35] and [37]).

cited,NACA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 659,"I find the evidence of the applicant's boyfriend to be of no assistance to me in determining whether the applicant was fit enough to attend Court on the morning of 12 October 2007, given the lack of time he appears to have spent with the applicant around the time when the hearing was due to take place and the fact that his evidence really only repeats what the applicant said to him rather than expresses his own observations on the applicant's alleged condition at the times when he did see her. Consequently, I find that the applicant has not demonstrated a satisfactory explanation for her failure to attend the hearing which was listed on 12 October 2007. 15 Applications for leave to appeal may be heard either by a Full Court or by a single judge: s 25(2)(a) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The principles relevant to a grant of leave are not in doubt, the root authority being D&eacute;cor Corp v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 3 FCR 397. Those principles are, firstly, whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being considered by the Full Court and, secondly, whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong. Later in time and in the context of an application for leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing an application for the judicial review of a decision of the Tribunal, Hely J remarked in NACA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 659 at [12] that an applicant ""had to show an arguable case that the RRT's decision should be quashed on the grounds of jurisdictional error"". 16 Whether a judgment is interlocutory, rather than final, and hence requires a grant of leave to appeal by virtue of s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act is sometimes a question of considerable nicety. It is the legal effect of a judgment, rather than its practical effect, that is determinative of the question whether a judgment is final or interlocutory."
distinguished,Calverley v Green [1984] HCA 81 ; (1984) 155 CLR 242,"However, the Tribunal accepted the Commissioner's submission that where joint holders had made unequal contributions to the acquisition of an asset, there being no presumption of advancement, a resulting trust is presumed for them as tenants in common in proportion to the values of their respective contributions to the consideration. The Tribunal referred to Calverley v Green [1984] HCA 81 ; (1984) 155 CLR 242. The Tribunal said that while there was some evidence as to the value of Claude Cassegrain's possible claim in defamation which he never ""commenced"", its value was by no means close to $4.25 million. The Tribunal accepted that the onus was on GCC and CFE to establish the value of Claude Cassegrain's rights, and that since they had not done so, it was reasonable to attribute the entire consideration of $9.5 million to the rights given up by GCC, pursuant to s 160ZD(4) of the Act , noted at [60] above. 65 The Tribunal noted that Claude Griffith had given evidence that GCC had claimed deductions for most of its expenses incurred in the joint venture and Cassiro's activities, including concessional deductions for research and development under s 73B of the Act , and that Claude Cassegrain's evidence was that an important objective of the settlement was to recover the amount that GCC had invested in Cassiro. The Tribunal considered that it ""would be double counting to allow those costs to be included in the cost base of the asset (rights) given up by GCC"" (at para 41). Consequently, the Tribunal found that the cost base of GCC's rights disposed of in the settlement by reason of s 160M(3)(b) (which, the Tribunal observed, effectively treated a release of GCC's rights as a disposal of the rights) was nil, given that the acquisition costs were ""either not capital in nature or would be double-counted"". 66 In the result, the Tribunal concluded that a capital gain of $9.5 million accrued to GCC under s 160Z, this being the excess of the disposal consideration over the cost base (nil) of the asset given up to acquire that sum. 77 (6) The applicants contend that ""the Tribunal's principal error of law was to ignore the terms of the Deed and to re-write it by reference to the principles of resulting trusts"". Although I would not describe the finding of a resulting trust as a rewriting of the Deed, I agree with the applicants that the resulting trust principle, recognised in the case of owners of land as joint tenants at law in Calverley v Green , has no application. The trust in question, whether called properly called ""resulting"" or ""implied"", is presumed in the absence of evidence of an intention to the contrary. In all the cases in which the principle has been applied of which I am aware, the trust has arisen from the provision of purchase money in a way that does not correspond with the way in which legal title is taken. Perhaps the principle would also apply if, although not in the form of money, the consideration could be regarded as equivalent to money. In the present case, however, the consideration provided for the payment of $8,835,083 and the CSIRO Parties' releases and contractual undertaking, consisted of releases and contractual undertakings by GCC and Claude Cassegrain separately and jointly and severally. 78 (7) Arguably, a further reason why a Calverley v Green resulting trust did not come into being is that it would be inconsistent with the intention of at least one party to the Deed that it should do so. By making the Apportionment Agreement, Claude Cassegrain showed an intention that was inconsistent with a presumption that he and GCC were to hold the sum of $9.5 million beneficially for themselves as tenants in common in equity in whatever proportions might turn out to reflect the values of their respective contributions to the consideration provided to the CSIRO Parties. 79 (8) So far as I know, no pre-existing asset disposed of by the Deed was owned by GCC and Claude Cassegrain as joint tenants. Each of them had its or his own separate potential claim against the CSIRO Parties. There were the claims already asserted by GCC alone in proceeding NG 3062 of 1992, with the further claims of conspiracy to cheat and defraud, abuse of process and defamation and injurious falsehood to be introduced by way of the proposed second further amended statement of claim (see [26] above). There was also a possible claim of defamation of Claude Cassegrain that had been obliquely referred to in the Cassegrain Letter (see [21] above). It is noteworthy, in passing, and only by way of interest, that in the Cassegrain Letter the amount claimed for defamation was $5 million, which was approximately one eleventh of the total amount of $56,033,000 claimed in that letter. The remaining $51,033,000 was clearly claimed by GCC alone. The sum of $5 million was not claimed for the defamation of Claude Cassegrain alone: it was claimed for defamation of ""GC&amp;Co, Cassegrain Family name, Cassegrain Group of companies and Claude Cassegrain and his family"". If the sum of $9.5 million were to be regarded as having been paid in conformity, on a pro rata basis, with the Cassegrain Letter, some $850,000 would be treated as having been paid in respect of the threatened defamation claim, of which, apparently Claude Cassegrain would be entitled to some unidentified part, the other parts being in respect of defamation claims by GCC, other unidentified Cassegrain companies, and other unidentified members of the Cassegrain family. There was, of course, no agreement that the Settlement Sum was related to the different elements identified in the Cassegrain Letter. 80 (9) There is no reason to distinguish between CSIRO's paying $8,835,083 and the CSIRO Parties' releases and contractual undertakings, as making up the consideration for the Cassegrain Parties' releases and other contractual undertakings. In other words, if it were possible to apportion the value of the Cassegrain Parties' releases and contractual undertakings as between GCC and Claude Cassegrain, it would be appropriate to apply those proportions to the sum of $8,835,083 (and, if it should be relevant, to the value of the CSIRO Parties' releases and contractual undertakings). 90 The second, fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth questions of law are: Second question of law ""Did the Tribunal err in law by not concluding that the deed of settlement entered into on 27 September 1993 between G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited, Claude Cassegrain, the CSIRO and Sirotech Limited (""the deed of settlement""), either alone or when considered with the simultaneous payment of $9.5m thereunder to, or at the direction of, G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited and Claude Cassegrain jointly, was the only relevant transaction under which a capital gain accrued to G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited and Claude Cassegrain jointly for the purposes of Part IIIA ...?"" Fifth question of law ""Did the Tribunal err in law by declining to apply s 160ZN(1)(a), ... to the capital gain which accrued to G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited and Claude Cassegrain jointly under the deed of settlement for the purposes of determining the amount of the capital gain which accrued to each of them under that transaction?"" Sixth question of law ""Did the Tribunal err in law when it went behind the deed of settlement in order to re-construct the transaction which it consummated in reliance on the doctrine of resulting trusts and the principle of law enunciated in Calverly v Green [1984] HCA 81 ; (1985) 155 CLR 242 [sic] ?"" Seventh question of law ""Did the Tribunal err in law by concluding that the applicants bore an onus to establish the value of the rights which they surrendered under the deed of settlement in favour of CSIRO and Sirotech Limited for the purposes of Part IIIA , ...?"" Ninth question of law ""Did the Tribunal err in law when it concluded that a capital gain of $9.5m accrued to G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited pursuant to sections 160M(3)(b) and 160Z ... in consequence of its entry into the deed of settlement and the simultaneous payment of $9.5m under it?"" 91 The grounds stated in the notice of appeal that relate to the second question of law are directed against the Tribunal's finding of a constructive trust. I agree that the circumstances did not give rise to a constructive trust for reasons that I gave earlier: the case is not one of purchase money (or perhaps its equivalent) for the purchase of property. 92 Ground 4(e) suggests that the consequence of removing constructive trust from the picture is that we are left with the result that a capital gain accrued to GCC and Claude Cassegrain: ""jointly, and, in consequence, as tenants in common in equal shares despite the operation of the apportionment agreement as a side agreement and, in particular, despite its operation in re-apportioning that settlement amount as between the two of them"""
cited,State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500,"In light of the above cases, and putting to one side the effect if any of the communications between Mr Myer and Mr Patching, there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty especially given the information acquired about the applicants in the ongoing AFP investigation. Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm: cf Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709 esp in its reliance on State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500 at 517. And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP. Given the police's function in the matter, the applicants would not have been objects of rescue (as they would have been if there was a duty to warn)."

cited,Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342).

discussed,Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 46 ; (1982) 150 CLR 160,"The majority also referred to the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 ( Fontana Films ) . The majority said at [163]: Gibbs CJ pointed out [Fontana Films [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 181; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 615] that, like the aliens power (s 51 (xix)), the corporations power is conferred ""by reference to persons"". He continued [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 181-2; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616]: However, having regard to the federal nature of the Constitution , it is difficult to suppose that the powers conferred by pars (xix) and (xx) were intended to extend to the enactment of a complete code of laws, on all subjects, applicable to the persons named in those paragraphs ... [I]n the case of the corporations described in s 51 (xx), extraordinary consequences would result if the Parliament had power to make any kind of law on any subject affecting such corporations ... Other difficulties in relation to s 51 (xx) are caused by the need to construe the Constitution as a whole, and thus to reconcile par (xx) with other parts of s 51. Although Gibbs CJ concluded [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] that it was both unnecessary and undesirable to attempt to define the outer limits of s 51(xx) , he did say [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] that: The words of par (xx) suggest that the nature of the corporation to which the laws relate must be significant as an element in the nature or character of the laws, if they are to be valid ... In other words, in the case of trading and financial corporations, laws which relate to their trading and financial activities will be within the power. As to foreign corporations, he added [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 183; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616-17] that ""the fact that the corporation is a foreign corporation should be significant in the way in which the law relates to it"". 16 The majority noted in [165]: ... the statements made by Gibbs CJ about laws relating to the trading and financial activities of trading and financial corporations being within power are to be understood as responding to the arguments advanced in that case. They are not to be read as attempting an exhaustive statement of the ambit of the power. Gibbs CJ explicitly denied [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] any intention of doing that. That said, it must be recognised that Gibbs CJ emphasised the importance of giving due weight to the words ""foreign"", ""trading"", and ""financial"" in considering the application of s 51(xx). 25 The majority said, at [55]: The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s 51(xx). It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. (Plainly, a foreign corporation is a corporation formed outside the limits of the Commonwealth.) No party or intervener called in question what was said about trading and financial corporations in R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] , Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 ; 40 ALR 609] , State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [(1982) [1982] HCA 72 ; 150 CLR 282 ; 44 ALR 1] or Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; [(1983) 152 CLR 570 ; 46 ALR 41]."

The Corporations Act then largely re-enacted the previous Corporations Law as a single Commonwealth law. Obviously, there are some differences, but none relevant to the present issue. As the terms of ss 588G and 588M were not materially altered when carried forward into the Corporations Act , it is not surprising that there are no observations in the parliamentary materials surrounding the enactment of the Corporations Act which enlighten the legislative intention in relation to those sections, or indeed of Div 4 of Pt 5.7B of the Corporations Act in which they stand."

followed,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73,"These grounds cannot succeed. The facts of this case are quite close to the facts of three unanimous decisions of Full Courts of this Court. The members of each court were different. The decisions are NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208 (Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ), NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 (French, Emmett and Dowsett JJ) and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 (Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ). In each case the court emphasised the proposition that the task of the Minister, through his delegate, and the Refugee Review Tribunal on appeal, pursuant to s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), is to consider whether they are satisfied that the requirements for the grant of a visa have been satisfied. It will be difficult to achieve the requisite degree of satisfaction if the appellant does not provide sufficient information, such as by not attending a hearing. In the absence of a positive finding of satisfaction, a visa application must be rejected. In NAVX at paragraph [5] the Full Court said this: ""In assessing the adequacy of [the Tribunal's] reasons, it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information. Clearly enough, the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing persecution in China. Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution, it could do little more than offer him an opportunity to elaborate. When he failed to accept that opportunity, the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application."" 5 In the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellants gave evidence that they did not open the post box where the invitation was sent until after the hearing date. Emmett FM did not accept that the letter was late in arriving. However, the authorities are clear that the reason for non-attendance at a hearing does not matter. If the Tribunal has complied with ss 425 and 425A of the Migration Act in inviting an applicant to attend a hearing, it may proceed under s 426A of the Act to consider and decide the matter without conducting any further inquiries. See NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 , NALQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 , VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 136 FCR 407; [2004] FCAFC 134 , NASF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 162 , Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 and Others [2005] FCAFC 73 , Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Indigenous Affairs and Another v SZFHC (2006) 150 FCR 439; [2006] FCAFC 73 , SZDPB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 110 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142.

referred to,Laybutt v Amoco Australia Pty Ltd (1974) 132 CLR 59,"The starting point is the option itself. There is no doubt that an option to purchase gives the optionee an equitable interest in the property. In fact the respondents concede that it is a prior equitable interest and that the answer to the first question is yes. There are many authorities on the point. It is sufficient for me to refer to the following: London and South Western Railway Co v Gomm (1882) 20 Ch D 562 at 580-581 per Jessel MR; Carter v Hyde [1923] HCA 36 ; (1923) 33 CLR 115; Commissioner of Taxes (Qld) v Camphin [1937] HCA 30 ; (1937) 57 CLR 127 at 132-134 per Latham CJ. Although Gibbs J (as he then was) in Laybutt v Amoco Australia Pty Ltd (1974) 132 CLR 59 ("" Laybutt "") at 75-76 identified the fact that an option to purchase gave rise to an equitable interest as a strong reason for characterising such an option as a conditional contract, rather than as an irrevocable offer, that 'standing controversy' as Sir Owen Dixon referred to it in Braham v Walker [1961] HCA 7 ; (1961) 104 CLR 366 at 376 has not been resolved and it is not necessary for me to take one view or the other for the purposes of answering the separate questions. It is to be noted that Gibbs J in Laybutt favoured the view that an option to purchase was a conditional contract to sell land which created a contingent equitable interest in the land."
referred to,NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1,"In relation to the case that the Tribunal's obligation to consider the appellant husband's claim was not limited to what he put forward in his application, counsel for the appellants referred his Honour to NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 (Black CJ, French and Selway JJ) at [55]-[63]. However, Lloyd-Jones FM distinguished NABE [2004] FCAFC 263 ; 144 FCR 1, observing that ' the present case does not fall into that category... [f] or this argument to succeed, the Tribunal would have to be satisfied that the actions of the ""gang"" was [sic] motivated by political opinion and were not criminally based '. In his Honour's view the Tribunal did not find that the unidentified gang members involved in the assault had ' political motivation nor that their activities were not entirely criminal in nature '. His Honour was satisfied that the Tribunal dealt with the material correctly. 14 On the basis of those findings which I have sought to summarise, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the appellants' application for curial review of the Tribunal's decision. I have difficulty with the proposition that the appellant husband's fear of persecution could not have arisen in the evidentiary context he postulated, notwithstanding the confinement of his political exposure to that of a media advisor to a politician, but seemingly that measure of concern on my part is not strictly necessary or essential to my decision-making. 15 On 25 May 2006 the appellants filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Court which framed three grounds of asserted error on the part of the Federal Magistrate, the same being supported by particulars. During the hearing of the appeal to this Court on 9 November 2006, the appellants sought to rely on an amended notice of appeal. That comprehensively amended notice of appeal contained the following grounds and particulars thereto: '1. His Honour committed an error of law in dismissing the appeal from a decision of the Second Respondent in circumstances where the Second Respondent failed to comply with section 430(1)(c) of the Migration Act 1958 , thereby committing jurisdictional error by not having regard to probative material. Particulars: (a) The Tribunal found ""there is no credible evidence to support the Applicant's claim that either the assault on him in 1997, or the assault and theft in 1999, or the alleged assault in March 2004, was politically (rather than criminally) motivated"". (b) The Second Respondent had regard to the ""Department's file..., which includes the protection visa application and... other material, including that supplied by the Applicant"". (c) The Applicant supplied ""various media reports"" including a newspaper article in The Island entitled ""Stage director assaulted by gang"", in which it was reported that the Appellant ""had been mercilessly assaulted by an armed gang alleged to be supporters of an organiser of the people's alliance"" who allegedly said to the Appellant ""... what was done to Laxshr (sic) would be done to you"". (d) In making a finding that there is no credible evidence to support the allegation of ""politically motivated"" attack on the Appellant the Tribunal either failed to have regard to such information and/or, if it did, it did not give reasons why that particular piece [of] critical corroborative evidence was not credible (cf section 430(1)(c) of the Act). 2. His Honour further erred in upholding the Second Respondent's decision in circumstances where the Second Respondent constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction and act judicially when making a critical finding as to the nature of persecution faced by the Appellant. Particulars: (a) The Appellant repeats particulars to Ground 1. (b) By its failure to take into account relevant material corroborating the Appellant's claim of a politically motivated attack on him in 1999 the Second Respondent constructively failed to consider the Appellant's claim. (c) The Second Respondent also failed to act judicially by interpreting the proper test of what amounts to persecution too narrowly by limiting its assessment of the nature of the 1999 assault on the Appellant by reference to the Appellant's political opinion as opposed to whether the attack on the Appellant was politically motivated. 3. His Honour further erred in upholding the Second Respondent's decision in circumstances where the Second Respondent failed to consider an integer of the appellants' claim.' Particulars: (a) At the hearing before the Tribunal the appellant said that ""the real death threats took place after the former Foreign Minister changed political parties. The Applicant said that he was seen on television on 1 May 2004, and from that moment he received ""real threats"". (b) The Tribunal then reminded the Appellant that ""the only matter raised by him in the complaints he had lodged with the police, related to the threats arising from the 1999 videotaping incident... and that his claimed fear of persecution arising from his political opinion was difficult to accept"". (c) However, in his Statutory Declaration dated 27 January 2005 sent to the Tribunal after the hearing, the appellant referred to his evidence at the hearing and reiterated that the alleged death threat he received was ""not a criminal act, because I received threats since I [changed] my parties and political opinion"". (d) In the preceding circumstances it was incumbent on the Tribunal to consider the claim that arose from the evidence, whether or not explicitly pleaded. (e) It appears the Tribunal considered the claim as articulated in the police complaints report in relation to the 1999 videotaping incident. (f) The Tribunal therefore constructively failed to consider an integer of the appellant's claim.' 16 In the context of the grounds the subject of that amended notice of appeal, counsel for the Minister submitted that the 'Minister does not consent to the appellant lodging an amended notice of appeal but accepts that the prejudice [the Minister] has suffered could be remedied by a costs order'. The Minister therefore requested that leave to amend be subject to an order that the appellants pay the Minister's costs thrown away. Counsel for the Minister further submitted that s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') was now being relied upon in substitution for the s 424A ground contained in the original notice of appeal, and 'that being so, all I'm asking for...is that having put in their submission late we did the reasonable thing to make our submission to be prepared on time; they changed the case and we should get costs thrown away'. That submission is correct in principle, but whether or not any significant amount of legal costs were in effect 'thrown away' may well be in reality debateable, and would be a matter for the Court's assessment officer who undertakes the taxation process. In the somewhat complex circumstances of this case, the submission would not be a necessary 'given'. 17 Counsel for the Minister emphasised further complaint in particular in relation to the third ground the subject of the amended notice of appeal, which the Minister contended to be a new ground, and submitted that leave should be refused as it 'was not run below' and was a 'weak ground'. However both parties addressed the Court on the merits or lack of merit thereof. In any event the view I have reached is not anchored to that third ground. 18 In relation to the first ground of appeal, the appellants submitted that the Tribunal did not pay 'realistic regard' to the relevant newspaper article, 'in that [the Tribunal failed to] give reasons why it did not find material contained in that article to be of probative value to the appellant's claim'. The newspaper article, which appeared in the Sri Lankan newspaper The Island , is reproduced, in part, below: 'Stage director assault by gang A prominent stage play producer and director...had been mercilessly assaulted by an armed gang alleged to be supporters of an organiser of the Peoples Alliance at Galle Road close to Waldya road junction in Dehiwela at about 11.55 pm, when the play director was engaged in pasting posters with two of his assistants of the stage play ""Prana appakaruwa"". ... Speaking to ""The Island"" [he] said that the gang had with them firearms: ""The persons who assaulted me shouted out loudly saying what was done to Laxshr would be done to you"". Dehiwela police sources, in this connection, said investigations were being pursued to take suspects into custody.'"

cited,ACCC v Apco Service Stations Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2006] HCATrans 272,"In the present case, counsel for the ACCC recognised that the judgment in Apco Service Stations was binding on me. They made the formal submission that the Full Court was in error when it required that there be some commitment, before there could be an understanding for the purposes of s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act . The reality is that the previous authorities dealing with the content of an understanding, as distinct from its formation, provide ample support for what the Full Court said in Apco Service Stations . More than ample support is also found in the analysis of the relevant provisions, which I have already set out in [24] [34]. As I have said, for the purposes of s 45(2)(a) there can be no such thing as an understanding that leaves each party to it free to do whatever it wishes. Whatever word may be chosen to represent the essential element of an understanding for the purposes of the relevant statutory provisions, it is clear that element involves the assumption of an obligation, unenforceable in any court of law, but merely morally binding or binding in honour. Any reservation that may have existed about this has been dispelled by the High Court, which dismissed the ACCC's application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court in Apco Service Stations on 2 June 2006. See ACCC v Apco Service Stations Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2006] HCATrans 272. At line 619, giving the judgment of himself and Hayne J, Gleeson CJ said: 'The decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court turned not upon any controversial view of the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act but upon the Full Court's view of the facts in the light of the case as pleaded and argued by the Commission. In the light of the facts as found, the case does not raise any issue of law suitable to a grant of special leave to appeal. The application is dismissed with costs.' 38 For all of these reasons, quite apart from its binding effect on me, the correctness of the Full Court's judgment in Apco Service Stations cannot be doubted."
referred to,Re Moage Ltd (in liq); Sheahan v Pitterino (1998) 82 FCR 10,"It is of course only communications which were brought into existence in furtherance of the illegal or improper purpose which are removed from the shield of privilege: Re Moage Ltd (in liq); Sheahan v Pitterino (1998) 82 FCR 10 at 19-20. Those which are for the purpose of advice about (for example) the enforceability of security instruments would be protected, even if those concerning the creation of those instruments were not. 37 There are a number of documents where Mr Nicol says their description and the supporting evidence of Mr Lee does not support the claim of privilege or where the description indicates the documents are not privileged. Senior counsel for Mr Nicol submitted that Mr Lee's affidavits did not generally go any distance to supporting the claim for legal professional privilege. His affidavit of 10 March 2006 does not say that he has examined the documents in PT.1 and PT.2, but I infer from its contents that he has done so. He addresses sequentially the documents in issue (or most of them) and expands a little upon their description in the List of Documents. It asserts a purpose for many of the documents; I do not place much weight on that evidence as the affidavit does not indicate that he has made any inquiries beyond himself examining the documents. He has not deposed to any knowledge of the circumstances of the work carried out by TP or to any other matters which might enhance the weight to be given to his assertions. His affidavit of 27 March 2006 concerning the documents in PT.4 is structured the same way, although it expressly states he has inspected the documents and that he sets out 'the basis for our client's claim for privilege'. In effect, his affidavits do little more than provide a description of most of the documents in issue, and make an assertion or submission as to why each should be privileged. 38 I have looked at the documents in PT.1 and PT.4 to ensure I understand as much as possible of Mr Lee's evidence."
cited,Hall v Whatmore [1961] VR 225,"By way of illustration I would note that a duty of care has been assumed, or found to exist: (i) in the conduct of a high speed police motor vehicle pursuit of a suspected criminal ( Schilling v Lenton (1988) 47 SASR 88; see also Marshall v Osmond [1983] 1 QB 1034; 57 Am Jur 2d, above SS439); (ii) where a superior officer failed to go to the assistance of another officer whom he knew was being attacked close by and for whom he had a responsibility ( Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police , above; Mullaney v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police [2001] EWCA Civ 700) ; (iii) in positively provoking or acting in disregard of a real and substantial risk of harm to a person ( Zalewski v Turcarolo , above) or property ( Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 1 WLR 1242); (iv) in providing for the safety and well-being of persons in police custody ( Hall v Whatmore [1961] VR 225; Howard v Jarvis [1958] HCA 19 ; (1958) 98 CLR 177; Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1999] UKHL 35 ; [2000] 1 AC 360); (v) in relation to preserving the confidentiality of information provided by an informant identifying a criminal suspect, the disclosure of which was likely to expose the informant and her husband to a greater risk of harm at the hands of the suspect than the ordinary risk to the general public ( Swinney v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police ); (vi) in Canada, to protect a woman who was unaware she was knowingly being used by police as ""bait"" to catch a serial rapist in circumstances in which the police deliberately failed to warn of the risk she faced for fear of compromising their investigation though knowing that the rapist would attack again and cause irreparable harm to his victim ( Doe v Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police (1998) 160 DLR 4 th 697); and (vii) in a United States jurisdiction, in delaying in responding to calls made by assault victims, the assurance that help was on its way having been given to them ( Chambers-Castanes v King County 669 P2d 451 (1983); and see Zitter, ""Liability for Failure of Police Response to Emergency Call"" , 39 ALR 4 th 691). 98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above (including that of England) is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that, particularly in cases of omissions to act, the police may nonetheless have, or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a ""special relationship"" with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her: see e.g. Brooks v Commissioner of Police at [22] and [29]; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ; in US jurisdictions the ""special relationship"" exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity, see e.g. Eaton, above at SS4 ; see also 57 Am Jur 2d, above, at SS410 ff. What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular ""operational"" context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist. Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody: Hall v Whatmore , above; and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D'Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at [101]-[102]; see also Cran v State of New South Wales , above; or in preventing a breach of the peace: Thompson v Vincent , above."
considered,SZMEZ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1097,The appellant was born in India but is a citizen of South Africa. He arrived in Australia on 8 September 2007 and on 19 October 2007 he lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The application was refused by a delegate of the Minister. The delegate's decision to refuse the protection visa was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal'). An application for review of the decision of the Tribunal was dismissed by Scarlett FM ( SZMEZ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1097). 2 The appellant appeals from the decision of Scarlett FM. 3 The appellant applied for an adjournment of this appeal for some months. He notified the first respondent's legal representatives of the application for adjournment on the morning of the hearing of the appeal. The application for adjournment was opposed.
followed,SBCC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 129,"The Tribunal found that the appellant engaged in the conduct for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee. As such, s 91R(3) of the Act applies and the Tribunal was entitled, having made such findings of fact, to determine that the conduct was not bona fide. The factual findings of the Tribunal thus operate to exclude the hypothesis proposed by the appellant. Further, s 91R(3) of the Act creates a reversal of onus of proof, which the appellant did not discharge: see NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1536 at [26] which was approved in SBCC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 129 at [39] ."
cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hobie Cat Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] ATPR 42-225,"Commission sought an order that Skins provide a letter on its letterhead to each of its current retailers, agents and/or distributors.

The letter advises the addressee of the results of this proceeding, including the pecuniary penalties imposed, and of the fact that Skins may only recommend a retail price, and is not allowed to specify to retailers a minimum price below which goods or services are not to be resold or advertised for sale. Skins consented to such an order. I considered that it was appropriate to make such an order (see s 86C(2); Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hobie Cat Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] ATPR 42-225). The Commission proposed that Skins pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty of $120,000 and that Mr Warhurst pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty of $14,000."
considered,Hammer Waste Pty Ltd v QBE Mutual Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1006,"In Hammer Waste Pty Ltd v QBE Mutual Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1006 , Palmer J referred to that decision and said: '... (I)n s 21(1) ... the word ""know"" is used in its ordinary sense; it implies actual, not constructive, knowledge both on the part of the insured and on the part of any agent or employee of the insured whose ""knowledge"" is to be imputed to the insured. The obligation to disclose something ""known"" can attach only to something which, at the time for disclosure, a person actually has in his or her consciousness or else something which exists in some record or other source of information which the person actually knows about and to which the person has access. So, for example, I ""know"" my driving licence number for the purposes of s 21(1) ... even though I cannot recite it off hand because I actually know that it is to be found in the plastic card in my wallet.' 736. I return to the three matters which may have required disclosure. I am satisfied that a reasonable person, in the circumstances, could be expected to know that each of those matters would be relevant to QBE's decision. I have indicated with respect to the third of those matters, divergence between contents of the newsletters and actual practice, that I am not satisfied that there was any significant divergence. However, for reasons which appear below, it is not necessary finally to decide that question. 737. QBE asserts that Mr Ryan was familiar with the content of the investment summary and knew that Mr Blackadder did not carry out detailed checks of the asset positions of applicants for loans as allegedly asserted in the newsletters, or credit checks against guarantors as asserted in the winter 1999 newsletter. It is said to follow that he had knowledge which should have been disclosed. In my view unless asked, Mr Ryan had no duty to disclose either the content of the newsletters or the actual practice which was adopted. At least for present purposes, neither matter, by itself, exposed either MDRN or QBE to risk. The relevant matter was the alleged divergence between the two. As I have said, I do not necessarily accept that there was a significant divergence. It is at least arguable that the practice as described by Mr Blackadder and Mr Ryan was a form of checking in the sense in which the term was used in the newsletters. Potential investors may have understood the newsletters to imply something more, but for present purposes we are looking at the subjective states of mind of Mr Blackadder and Mr Ryan."
applied,Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148,"principles governing the grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions in both private and public law litigation are well known. They have been summarised by Mason A-CJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153 as follows: In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. An applicant seeking an interlocutory injunction must be able to show sufficient "" colour of right "" to the final relief, in aid of which the interlocutory injunction is sought: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited [2001] HCA 63 at [11] , [2001] HCA 63 ; 208 CLR 199 at 217 per Gleeson CJ.

cited,WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman [1980] FCA 79 ; (1980) 30 ALR 559,"That is not to say that discovery is unavailable in judicial review. Whether discovery is ordered in a particular case ""depends upon the nature of the case and the stage of the proceedings at which the discovery is sought"": WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman [1980] FCA 79 ; (1980) 30 ALR 559 at 567. The fact that an applicant can obtain a statement of reasons under s 13 of the ADJR Act is not determinative of whether discovery should be ordered. There are numerous instances of judicial review proceedings in which discovery has been ordered in this Court or where the jurisdiction to do so has been accepted: WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman; Commissioner of Taxation v Nestle Australia Ltd [1986] FCA 368 ; (1986) 12 FCR 257 ; TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels (1992) ATPR 41-190 per Gummow J; and Australian Securities Commission v Somerville (1994) 51 FCR 38 and Canwest Global Communications Corp v Australian Broadcasting Authority (Hill J, 16 June 1997, unreported). See also Re Federal Commissioner of Taxation, Ex parte Swiss Aluminium Australia Ltd (1987) 72 ALR 247. 46 To grant leave to interrogate in the circumstances presented here would be to encourage not merely ""fishing"" but full-scale ""trawling"". It is well-established in relation to discovery that a party who can demonstrate nothing to support an allegation will not be granted access to the documents of the opposing party in the hope of discovering some such support. See, for example, WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman. This principle applies with equal force to those seeking relief under the ADJR Act : Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Wong at [29]-[32]. It is not open to a party merely to allege that a decision was made without any proper basis and then seek to use the compulsory process of the Court to attempt to find out if that allegation has any foundation. Before discovery can be ordered, there must be some evidence that can support an arguable case for review, proof of which is likely to be aided by requiring production of relevant documents."
cited,SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214,"Observations made by Allsop J, as his Honour then was, in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at 262, para 216 also serve as a reminder of the need, in relation to the application of s 424A in particular cases, to read the reasons of the Tribunal as a whole, in order to understand whether particular ""information"" truly provided the ""reason"" for the Tribunal's decision. 11 When one reads the reasons for decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal one sees the following paragraphs which in the circumstances of the present case are material. At appeal book page 90: As put to the applicant in the course of the hearing, generally speaking, members of the Hindu community in India are not ill-treated. In consideration of the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has a political, ethnic/racial or a religious profile that means he has suffered any persecution as contemplated by the Convention or that there's a real chance of this occurring to the applicant in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Tribunal appreciates that there are religious based tensions in India. However, on balance, independent country information indicates that whilst there are problems in some areas, the Indian Constitution provides for freedom of religion and that the government generally respected this right in practice etcetera. 12 Further, at appeal book page 91, the Tribunal stated: In essence, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there are Convention reasons as to why the applicant should not return to India. In consideration of the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has a political, ethnic/racial or a religious profile that means that there is a real chance of persecution as contemplated by the Convention occurring to the applicant in the reasonably foreseeable future. Notably and by his own admission, the applicant wants to stay in Australia to work, raising serious doubts about his claims of persecution. In sum, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. 13 The Tribunal's reasons are very detailed indeed. Reading them as a whole, one sees that influences on the conclusions reached in the passages which I have quoted were an assessment by the Tribunal of the male Appellant's credibility, having regard to evidence which he gave before the Tribunal and independent country information. 14 The authorities to which I have made reference make it plain that the country information does not constitute ""information"" for the purposes of s 424A and further, that the Tribunal's views in relation to credibility do not constitute ""information"". Those views do not seem to have been informed by reference to anything provided in the initial visa application. Thus, the question as to whether the exclusion found in s 424A(3) as it stood prior to the insertion of s 424A(3)(ba) is not raised for consideration."
cited,Andrew &amp; Frewin Pty Ltd v Arrow Limited [1990] FCA 247,"As the proceeding was commenced in the New South Wales Registry, Sydney is presently the ' proper place ' in relation to the proceeding (see the definition of that expression in O 1 r 4) and, unless an order is made to the contrary, the place of trial will be Sydney (O 30 r 6(1)). However, it is not necessary for the proceeding to be transferred to the Cairns Registry to enable the trial, or any part of it, to be heard in Cairns. The Court may direct that the trial, or any part of the trial, be held at a place other than the proper place (O 30 r 6(2)). In Andrew &amp; Frewin Pty Ltd v Arrow Limited [1990] FCA 247 the Full Court observed that O 30 r 6 authorised the Court to take evidence in various cities so as to accommodate the needs of witnesses notwithstanding that a different city was the proper place."
applied,Spunwill Pty Ltd v BAB Pty Ltd (1994) 36 NSWLR 290,"In my view, counsel for the respondent's contention cannot be accepted. It is clear that the contractual intention was to provide the applicant with a termination payment of a minimum of six months, regardless of whether the relationship between the parties ended by the non renewal of the term of the consultancy agreement on the expiry of the existing term or by the termination of the agreement (other than for a reason set out in cl 8.1) during the currency of the term, of the consultancy agreement. This construction is consistent with the presence in the clause of the words 'or the Term (as extended or renewed) is not renewed '. The construction contended for by the respondent is inconsistent with the presence of those words in the clause and renders those words otiose. In my view, it is obvious that there was a mistake by the draftsman in using the word 'lesser' when the word 'greater' should have been used to give effect to the obvious intention of the parties. Where there is an obvious mistake the Court can give effect to the true contractual intention of the parties without there being any need for rectification. The principle was expressed thus by Santow J in the case of Spunwill Pty Ltd v BAB Pty Ltd (1994) 36 NSWLR 290 at 299: '...Where a court can discern the intent of the parties from an examination of the document as a whole, words may be supplied, omitted or corrected in the instrument, where it is clearly necessary in order to avoid absurdity or inconsistency: Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420 at 426-427. In such cases rectification of the document is not required: Re United Pacific Transport Pty Ltd [1968] Qd R 517; Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (at 346).'"
cited,Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284,"Of course, there cannot be a general rule that a legal representative of the employer or the former employer of the examinee should be permitted to attend to protect the employer's privilege. There may well be circumstances where to do so would jeopardise the investigation: see eg Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at [35] , [38]; see also Rochfort at 145 (Mason J) (stating that request for the production of privileged information should generally be directed to the employer but ""the protection of the employer's interests [in the information] must give way to the public interest in the efficient administration of justice in case of collision between the two""). But in the absence of such a circumstance, the voluntary grant by ASIC of a limited right to be present in the manner outlined by counsel for AWB might have forestalled the issues raised in these proceedings."
followed,Egan v Maher [No. 2] (1978) 35 FLR 252,"The 'last in time' argument is novel. It has not been considered expressly by any court previously. It is based on the principle of surrender by implication. That principle has been applied as the doctrine of incompatible offices in cases such as Egan v Maher [No. 2] (1978) 35 FLR 252 at 263, Mellor v Horn (1988) 25 IR 157 at 159 161 and Johnson v Beitseen (1989) 41 IR 395 at 412 413. In Re Cholosznecki; Re Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union [2006] FCA 452 (2006) 151 IR 218, the principle of implied surrender was applied in determining that a member of an organisation had surrendered her membership of one of its branches by applying to become, and being accepted and treated as, a member of another branch, where membership of more than one branch was expressly prohibited by the rules. The principle operates by implication of law, rather than by implied intention. The intention is imputed to a person, as a result of the assumption of a second position incompatible with the first, to relinquish the first position. The principle is subject to the express provisions of the rules, but not easily displaced by them, because it has been held to apply even where there were express, mandatory provisions about resignation. The principle of implied surrender is analysed in Cholosznecki at [29] [34]. In the present case, counsel for Mr Reid and Mr Wisniewski contended that r 5.5 does nothing more than to bring forward the operation of the doctrine of incompatible offices to the stage where nominations for offices occur. He argued that, just as the assumption of a second office, incompatible with one already held, is taken to be an implied resignation of the first office, so the lodging of a second nomination, incompatible with one already lodged, is taken to be the implied withdrawal of the first nomination. 20 Having considered the arguments and the available authorities, I am of the view that the 'last in time' argument is correct. The doctrine of incompatible offices is but an example of the broader principle of surrender by implication. This was made clear by Willes J in the case to which the doctrine of incompatible offices has been traced, Iron Ship Coating Co Ltd v Blunt (1868) LR 3 CP 484 at 488. The principle itself is related to the common law doctrine of election between inconsistent rights. This relationship was explored in the judgment of Northrop J (with whom Evatt J agreed) in Egan at 263 264, where his Honour referred to Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan [1964] HCA 20 ; (1964) 111 CLR 41 and Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634. In Tropical Traders at 55, Kitto J (with whom Taylor and Menzies JJ agreed) said: 'not that election is a matter of intention. It is an effect which the law annexes to conduct which would be justifiable only if an election had been made one way or the other'. This view was followed by Stephen J in Sargent at 646. Also in Sargent , at 656, Mason J said: 'in some instances election may take place as a matter of conscious choice with knowledge of the existence of the alternative right and in other cases it may occur when the law attributes the character of an election to the conduct of a party.' 22 It is no answer to this line of argument to say that, at the time when it arrives, the later nomination is invalid because of the former. As Northrop J (Evatt J agreeing, Smithers J dissenting on this point) made clear in Egan at 262, the inconsistent assumption of rights does not have to be valid in order to constitute an implied surrender of the original right. In that case, the holder of the office of National Assistant Secretary of an organisation accepted appointment to the office of National Secretary-Treasurer, on the assumption that there was a vacancy in the latter office. The Court held that in law there was no vacancy in the office of National Secretary-Treasurer, but the officer concerned was nonetheless taken to have resigned impliedly from his position as National Assistant Secretary. In any event, in a case such as the present, there is no particular ground for holding that a second or subsequent nomination is invalid. When it is received, all that can be said is that there have been two acts of the candidate which cannot stand together, because of the operation of r 5.5. As a logical proposition, it is equally open to say that the second nomination invalidates the first as it is to say that the first nomination invalidates the second. I have come to the conclusion that the principle of implied surrender requires that the law take the view that it is the first nomination that is surrendered impliedly by the lodging of the second. The first becomes invalid, not the second. The adoption of such a proposition does not offend on policy grounds. Policy is blind to the relative importance of the two or more positions for which nominations have been received, and to the personalities of those who have been nominated. No greater inconvenience is caused to a returning officer who must determine, at the date of closure of nominations, which of the nominations is the one that can be treated as valid. 'Last in time' is a simple rule to apply."
followed,Puxu Pty Ltd v Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd (1980) 31 ALR 73,"Their Honours then provided certain guidance in considering and determining whether the suggested misrepresentation has been made, and is or is likely to be misleading or deceptive of the public. The first item of guidance was to identify the relevant section or sections of the public by reference to whom the question of whether conduct is, or is likely to be, misleading or deceptive falls to be tested. The second, having identified the relevant section of the public, was to consider the issue by reference to all who come within it, ""including the astute and the gullible, the intelligent and the not so intelligent, the well educated as well as the poorly educated, men and women of various ages pursuing a variety of vocations"". That quotation was adopted from the judgment of Lockhart J in Puxu Pty Ltd v Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd (1980) 31 ALR 73 at 93. In Campomar , the High Court confirmed at [105] that the Court may well decline to regard as controlling the application of s 52 assumptions by persons whose reactions are ""extreme or fanciful""."
cited,Minehan v AGL Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd (1998) 134 ACTR 1,"While the structure of the Trust Deed and Schedule C is such that, in the circumstances, Mr Kowalski had some entitlement to be paid a sum out of the fund, the deed did not give him any absolute entitlement to be paid a TPD Benefit as such. For such a benefit to be payable the trustee had to determine whether Mr Kowalski fell within the definition of ""Total and Permanent Disablement"" in cl 1(6) of the Trust Deed. Part (b) of that definition required the trustee to form an opinion as to whether Mr Kowalski was incapacitated to such an extent as to render him unlikely ever to engage or work for reward in any occupation for which he is reasonably suited by education, training or experience. The cl 1(6) determination and the opinion embedded in it were ones for the trustee not the court: see Ford and Lee, Principles of the Law of Trusts , [5185] and the cases cited therein. Accordingly, absent a favourable determination by the trustee, it cannot be said, as Mr Kowalski claims in his pleading, that he has an entitlement to a TPD Benefit: but cf Minehan v AGL Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd (1998) 134 ACTR 1 at [68] where the court itself executed the trust a rare event. 18 Again the pleading alleges repeated failures by the trustee to consider any of the medical evidence that was available to it and hence whether he was entitled to a TPD Benefit. Assuming that there were times at which a duty to consider so arose, the most that Mr Kowalski could expect from a court by way of relief if any would be a direction to the trustee to consider whether, in the circumstances, a cl 1(6) determination should be made and this on the basis of an unreasonable and culpable failure to consider the matter. Mr Kowalski does not seek such relief in this proceeding. 21 There is now a significant body of Australian case law dealing with challenges to the decisions of superannuation trustees not to provide a particular benefit to a member because the trustee has determined that the member did not fall within the relevant trust definition for that benefit. Many of these cases have involved claims for total and permanent disability benefits having criteria similar to those embodied in cl 1(6): see eg Jeffrey Guy Baker v Local Government Superannuation Scheme Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1173 ; Hay v Total Risk Management Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 94 ; Sayseng v Kellogg Superannuation Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 945 ; Flegeltaub v Telstra Super Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 107 ; Minehan v AGL Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd ; Vidovic v Email Superannuation Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Bryson J, 3 March 1995)."
followed,Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27,"in Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27, the High Court revisited the question of late applications for amendment of pleadings, and the relevance to such applications of the powers and principles of case-management. The High Court reversed the order of the primary judge allowing the plaintiff to make substantial amendments to its claim at the start of the trial. At [92], Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ referred to the fact that case-management ""is now an accepted aspect of the system of civil justice administered by courts in Australia."" At [98], their Honours said with reference to the rule of Court conferring case-management powers on the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory: Of course, a just resolution of proceedings remains the paramount purpose of r 21; but what is a ""just resolution"" is to be understood in light of the purposes and objectives stated. Speed and efficiency, in the sense of minimum delay and expense, are seen as essential to a just resolution of proceedings. This should not detract from a proper opportunity being given to the parties to plead their case, but it suggests that limits may be placed upon re-pleading, when delay and cost are taken into account. The Rule's reference to the need to minimise costs implies that an order for costs may not always provide sufficient compensation and therefore achieve a just resolution. It cannot therefore be said that a just resolution requires that a party be permitted to raise any arguable case at any point in the proceedings, on payment of costs. At [111], their Honours concluded: An application for leave to amend a pleading should not be approached on the basis that a party is entitled to raise an arguable claim, subject to payment of costs by way of compensation. There is no such entitlement. All matters relevant to the exercise of the power to permit an amendment should be weighed. The fact of substantial delay and wasted costs, the concerns of case management, will assume importance on an application for leave to amend. Statements in JL Holdings which suggest only a limited application for case management do not rest upon a principle which has been carefully worked out in a significant succession of cases. On the contrary, the statements are not consonant with this Court's earlier recognition of the effects of delay, not only upon the parties to the proceedings in question, but upon the court and other litigants. Such statements should not be applied in the future. The present case is not one concerning a late application for amendment of pleadings. In many senses, it is more serious. It is a case of repeated refusals, not merely failures, to comply with orders of the court requiring the appellants to make discovery of documents and to allow Ms Wang's solicitor to inspect their discovered documents. Mr Lee had persisted with a demand for payment as a pre-condition for providing inspection of documents, despite advice from his own solicitor that this was not a course open to him. Even in the face of deadlines specified by the federal magistrate for the performance of obligations under earlier orders, Mr Lee proposed leisurely timetables for the performance of those obligations and a further adjournment of the trial, which had already been adjourned once. The circumstances in which the appellants had ceased to be represented by their solicitor were never revealed, making it more difficult for them to rely on lack of representation as a factor justifying the adjournment of the trial. It is significant that, despite the lack of representation and Mr Lee's difficulty with English, the two affidavits of 7 and 9 April demonstrated to the federal magistrate that Mr Lee had access to someone who was sufficiently fluent in English, and had sufficient understanding of the court processes, to produce affidavits in something close to the proper form. It would have been open to the federal magistrate to reach the conclusion that Mr Lee was attempting to postpone an inevitable judgment against the appellants on Ms Wang's claim, and that the need to visit his father in China was raised as part of such an attempt. The fact that the federal magistrate was kinder to Mr Lee than he needed to be, by not making such a finding, should not lead to a successful appeal from the exercise of the federal magistrate's discretion. If the powers given by rules of court to give judgment against a defaulting party were never to be exercised, because of a supposed principle that judgment for a large sum of money should not be given without a trial, the grants of express powers by rules would be hollow. Case-management would be deprived of its only real sanction against a party who, while resisting a claim for a substantial sum of money, defaults persistently in complying with orders of a Court. The framers of rr 13.03A and 13.03B of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules cannot have intended that those rules should be subject to such a principle that would enable a party against whom a substantial monetary claim is made to defend that claim by failing persistently to take steps necessary to bring the claim on for trial. Any principle derived from Freeman is much more limited than that suggested by counsel for the appellants. Freeman is best regarded as turning on its particular circumstances, and as belonging to an era before the broad adoption of case-management principles. As the recent judgment in Aon shows, case-management principles have assumed a greater importance than they were thought to have had, even as recently as 1997, when JL Holdings was decided. It is clear from the second passage I have quoted from Aon in [36] above that the principle stated in JL Holdings should no longer be followed. If there remains a narrower principle derived from Freeman than that suggested by counsel for the appellants, such a principle could not be applicable in the present case. There is no injustice in judgment for a large sum of money against Heng V and Mr Lee, having regard to Mr Lee's apparent determination not to comply with repeated orders requiring him to produce for inspection all of the appellants' discoverable documents. Conclusion"
cited,SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 325,"I granted leave to the appellant to appeal from a decision of Smith FM ( SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 325). His Honour dismissed her application, under rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 , for a review of the Tribunal decision affirming the decision of a delegate of the first respondent ('the Delegate') to refuse her application for a protection visa. That application was based on an alleged failure of the Tribunal to comply with ss 424A(1) and 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'), an alleged reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal and an alleged denial of procedural fairness. The appellant initially appeared without representation. I made an order under Order 80 rule 4 of the Federal Court Rules for legal assistance to be provided to the appellant. Ms Nolan of counsel now appears, pro bono. 2 The amended notice of appeal raises two grounds of appeal, namely, that the Federal Magistrate failed to find: &#8226; jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal by failure to consider an integer of the appellant's claim to hold a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of religion; and &#8226; denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal, thereby a breach of s 425 of the Act by failing to identify for the appellant at the Tribunal hearing the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. 3 It is not necessary to canvass the background facts relating to the appellant in any detail. In essence and relevantly the appellant claimed that: &#8226; During a difficult period in her life the appellant was assisted by a friend (Ms W) in opening a beauty salon in her home town. In the middle of 2001, Ms W went missing. The appellant learned from the police that Ms W had been suspected of smuggling Bibles into China. The appellant was later contacted by Ms W and asked to smuggle Bibles into China. Ms W said that she needed ' a reliable person who did not have any religious background ' and who was not associated with the Shouters (an underground Christian religious organisation to which Ms W belonged). The appellant agreed to smuggle the Bibles. &#8226; The appellant's beauty salon became a ""secret station"" for the smuggling. Later, Ms W advised the appellant to leave home as the police had been informed. She left China with a false passport. &#8226; In the application for a protection visa ('the visa application') the appellant stated her religion as ""Christian"". &#8226; In the statutory declaration that accompanied the visa application, the appellant made no claim to fear persecution on the basis of her own Christianity. She claimed that, as a person who had smuggled Bibles into China, she would be regarded as a Christian or as a person who engaged in smuggling Bibles."
cited,Hall v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 415 ; (2000) 97 FCR 387,"Reference was made to the decision of Finkelstein J in Hall v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 415 ; (2000) 97 FCR 387 at 394, where his Honour observed (at [29]): ... the power to cancel a visa that is conferred by s 501(2) should, in my opinion, be construed to allow the cancellation of a permit to remain in Australia, which by force of the transitional provisions continues in force as a visa. That is, because permission to remain in Australia granted before the Migration Reform Act continues in force as a visa, it may be cancelled as a visa. Any other construction would result in the absurd position that a non-citizen who constitutes a danger or threat to the Australian community by reason of his or her past criminal conduct could not be removed from Australia. To similar effect were the observations of Kiefel J in Andary v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1380 at [7] where her Honour said that a transitional (permanent) visa 'was liable to cancellation'."
followed,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 ; (2004) 78 ALJR 92,"speaking, the Tribunal is under no duty to inquire or to investigate claims imposed upon it (see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 ; (2004) 78 ALJR 92). Such a duty will only arise in rare cases. Those cases will be where it is very obvious that material is readily available which is centrally relevant to the decision to be made (see Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169 170). As I have already said, nothing in the materials before me suggests that such a course of investigation should have been undertaken by the Tribunal in the present case."
applied,GR Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631,"The discussions between Mr Lewarne and Mr Dempsey two days after the money had been paid over indicate that Mr Lewarne, at least, had not abandoned the idea of entering into a more formal contract. Given Mr Scotts earlier participation in discussions with Mr Dempsey I think it more likely than not that this was also his position. In my view Mr Scotts and Mr Lewarne intended to be bound immediately but also intended to make a further contract which would substitute for the original contract; GR Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631. That substitute contract was never made and therefore the proposed terms of it are not relevant to the resolution of the present issues. 48 In the negotiations leading up to the agreement, Mr Scotts spoke both for himself and Momentum. Indeed, as I have earlier commented, Mr Scotts referred to himself and Momentum interchangeably and without apparent distinction. On balance I find the evidence supports the conclusion that Momentum, as well as Mr Scotts, was a party to this preliminary contract. It is likely that Mr Anthony Scotts was also a member of the partnership from the same date however I have only limited evidence on this point which I have not been asked to decide. In general, I do not find it necessary to distinguish between Mr Scotts' conduct when he was acting for Momentum and when he was acting for himself and shall not do so unless there is a particular need."
cited,Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 539 ,"It is necessary to bear in mind that the requirement of a prima facie case has to be met at the outset of proceedings, usually on an ex parte basis. A prima facie case in this sense does not amount to a prediction of an outcome or a conclusion that a finding for the applicant is the likely ultimate result of a case. It is necessary that there be a foundation established for an arguable case ( WSGAL Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 39 FCR 472 per Beaumont J at 476; Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 549). It has been said that 'a prima facie case is made out if, on the material before the court, inferences are open which if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed' ( Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (In liq) (Receiver and Manager appointed) (1991) 30 FCR 102 at 110; Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (above) per Carr J at [17]; and Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd (2005) 212 ALR 551 at [23].

referred to,Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534,"In Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd and Others [1988] FCA 202 ; (1988) 81 ALR 397 Woodwood J (at 400-401) observed that the Court had an 'absolute and unfettered' discretion with regard to the award of costs. In Donald Campbell and Company Limited v Pollak [1927] AC 732 Viscount Cave L.C. said at 811-812: A successful defendant in a non-jury case has no doubt, in the absence of special circumstances, a reasonable expectation of obtaining an order for the payment of his costs by the plaintiff; but he has no right to costs unless and until the Court awards them to him, and the Court has an absolute and unfettered discretion to award or not to award them. This discretion, like any other discretion, must of course be exercised judicially, and the judge ought not to exercise it against the successful party except for some reason connected with the case.

considered,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190,"Like the Federal Magistrate, I can see no error in the Tribunal having reached such a view. Whether or not I would have come to such a view is completely irrelevant. Again, like the Federal Magistrate, I can see no other procedural fairness defect in the course adopted by the Tribunal. Indeed, in so far as one can glean the nature of the hearing from the summary in the reasons, it seems that the Tribunal went beyond the strict requirements of s 424A of the Migration Act as they have been explained by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 , and in that Court's earlier decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 1009."
cited,Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152,"Although the phrase ""carries on a business"" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows: 1. ""Business"" in the context of s 2B is normally a ""wide and general"" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since ""business"" includes ""a business not carried on for profit"": NT Power 219 CLR at 116. 2. The phrase ""carries on a business"" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that ""with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia."" (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794). 3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, ""carrying on a business"" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451. 4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as ""carrying on a business"": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not ""carrying on a business"" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes ""carrying on a business"". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services. 5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] ."
followed,Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473,"Counsel relied on Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 and argued that although the Tribunal might have been entitled to examine the appellant's living circumstances in China and reach the conclusion that no past persecution had in fact occurred, the absence of past persecution did not mean that there was not a real chance of persecution in the future. He argued that the Tribunal paid little to no attention to the risks of the appellant suffering persecution upon her return to China. 25 The Federal Magistrate agreed that the Tribunal had dismissed the question of future persecution quite summarily. However, His Honour pointed out that no evidence had been produced to indicate that the appellant would behave any differently in the future to how she had in the past, and concluded: It would in those circumstances be an otiose exercise, having reached conclusions about past activities not having led to persecution, for the Tribunal to expressly posit such activities happening in the future and then make findings based on a prognostication of future events when it was given no basis for considering that future activities would be any different or the response of the authorities any more persecutory. In these circumstances, the Tribunal can only find, as here, that no chance of serious harm on account of such activities will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future. 26 His Honour therefore dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review. 27 The appellant's notice of appeal raises several grounds of appeal. The first three challenge the Federal Magistrate's conclusions on the Tribunal's findings in relation to the issue of future persecution, asserting that His Honour erred in holding that: a) The Tribunal's failure to assess a risk of future persecution did not amount to jurisdictional error, b) It was not required to examine the issue, despite the appellant not giving evidence as to any difference in future behaviour; and c) The Tribunal was not required to make findings relating to this question and that their absence did not amount to the Tribunal asking the wrong question by focusing on any persecution the appellant may have suffered in the past, rather than the future. 28 The notice of appeal also challenges the Federal Magistrate's conclusion in dismissing the claim of jurisdictional error in that the Tribunal's findings regarding the appellant's claimed fear of persecution for reasons of religion, and in particular its failure to consider whether restrictions on public worship amounted to persecution. 29 Finally, it is asserted in the notice of appeal that the Federal Magistrate erred in concluding that the Tribunal had properly considered the appellant's claim for fear of persecution on the basis of a political opinion imputed to her by reason of her son's political activities in Australia, and had properly taken into account the fact of the grant of a protection visa to the appellant's son in its consideration. 30 During argument the appellant's counsel applied for leave to amend a further ground of appeal directed to the passage in the Tribunal's reasons referred to in [8] of these reasons. Counsel asked for time to consider the precise wording of the amendment. I directed the appellant to formulate the amendment within 7 days and each party to provide me with written submissions in relation to the application for leave to amend and the substance of the amendment. The parties complied. 31 Whilst the first respondent argued that the ground should be dismissed, no separate argument was put that leave should not be given. The ground of appeal for which leave was sought is: 4. The learned Federal Magistrate erred in not holding that the Tribunal had: 4.1 upon finding that ""the repression of the Uighers stems deeper than mere disadvantage, as they are being deliberately persecuted for practising and preserving their culture and religion""; 4.2 committed jurisdictional error by not considering whether, in light of that finding, the Appellant, as an Uigher person, would therefore also be persecuted if she were to return to China. 32 It would be appropriate in the circumstances of this appeal to grant leave to amend in the absence of any objection by the first respondent and because the ground is related to the first ground, and because in my opinion the ground should be upheld. 45 The respondent further submitted that no error of the type referred to in Appellant S395/2002 216 CLR 473 arose because the Tribunal focused on the appellant's particular circumstances. The first respondent argued that the Federal Magistrate correctly held that the Tribunal was properly engaged in the task of identifying whether a well-founded fear of ""serious harm"" had been established, rather than attempting to apply, it submitted, an inappropriate test as to what constitutes religious persecution. 46 The respondent submitted that the Federal Magistrate was correct in dealing with the Tribunal's decision regarding the appellant's son and that no error was apparent in His Honour's decision and ground 3 should be dismissed. 47 The first respondent contended that the appellant's late-raised fourth ground of appeal should be dismissed. The first respondent submitted that, properly read, the passage of the Tribunal's reasons did not mean that the Tribunal accepted as fact that all Uighers are being deliberately persecuted. Rather, it submitted, the Tribunal was reciting an assertion of information provided by Amnesty International. It therefore submitted that no jurisdictional error arose from this passage of the Tribunal's decision. 48 There are four reasons why, in my opinion, this appeal should be allowed and the orders made by the Federal Magistrate set aside, and orders made for the issue of the constitutional writs. 49 First, in my opinion, contrary to the finding of the Federal Magistrate, the Tribunal did not address the appropriate question in considering the appellant's claims. The question that the Tribunal needed to consider was whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution. This required the Tribunal to consider whether if the appellant were to return to her country of origin, in this case China, there would be a real chance she would be persecuted for a Convention reason. 51 However, a finding that she has not previously been subject to persecution for a Convention reason does not necessarily answer the question as to whether there is a real chance that she will be subject to persecutory conduct in the future if she were to return to China for a Convention reason: Appellant S395/2002 216 CLR 473 per Gummow and Hayne JJ at 499. 52 In this case, the Tribunal addressed the question of past conduct but did not consider the question of future conduct. That specific question had to be addressed and answered. In that sense, it did not exercise the jurisdiction which is bestowed upon it under the Act. 53 The second reason why, in my opinion, the Tribunal fell into error is that the Tribunal did not address one integer of the appellant's claim. She claimed that, by reason of her husband's conduct, her son-in-law's conduct and, more relevantly, her son's conduct, their political opinions would be imputed to her which would give rise to persecutory conduct on the part of the authorities. The Tribunal did not consider whether her son's conduct and the granting of a protection visa to him as a result of the decision of the Tribunal would be likely to give rise to persecution for their political opinions. The Tribunal misunderstood the relevance of the appellant's son being granted a protection visa. 54 Thirdly, in my opinion, the Tribunal fell into error by failing to deal properly with the appellant's claims of feared persecution because of her religious beliefs. There was significant evidence put before the Tribunal as to the manner in which the appellant was restricted by the Chinese State in the practice of her religion, and also as to the manner in which she wished to practice her religion, namely in public with other members of the Muslim community. Despite this, the Tribunal held that ""[t]he applicant has not claimed ... that she was effectively prevented from practising her religion in private. She made no claim that she suffered persecution or came to the attention of the authorities on the basis of her religion."""
cited,Arno v Forsyth (1986) 9 FCR 576,"It was submitted alternatively on behalf of Mr Oke that the later provision of the privilege notice meant that the Birchgrove warrant was not executed reasonably, and so was invalid, relying on Arno v Forsyth (1986) 9 FCR 576. The same findings lead me to conclude that there was not such unreasonableness in the execution of the Birchgrove warrant as to lead to its invalidity. 63 The failure to provide a complete copy of the original Birchgrove warrant (subject to s 3H(5)) amounted to a breach s 3H(1). There is nothing in the Act to suggest that the AFP can selectively determine which parts of a search warrant it will make available to the occupier, and which parts it will not. However, it does not necessarily follow that the effect of that breach is to invalidate the entire search."
cited,Macteldir Pty Ltd v Dimoski [2006] FCA 489 ; (2006) 152 FCR 487,"See also in this context the judgment of Lindgren J in Macteldir Pty Ltd v Dimoski [2006] FCA 489 ; (2006) 152 FCR 487 , where his Honour said at p 489, par 6, discussing whether an order of dismissal was final or interlocutory: 'Whether a judgment if final, rather than interlocutory, usually depends on whether it finally determines the rights of the parties in respect of the matter of dispute between them: Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 443 per Windeyer J; Licul v Corney [1976] HCA 6 ; (1976) 180 CLR 213 at 225; Carr v Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd (No 1) [1981] HCA 20 ; (1981) 147 CLR 246 ('Carr') at 248; Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 ('Luck') at [4].

referred to,Oakley v Lyster [1931] 1 KB 148,"relies upon the principles referred to in Oakley v Lyster [1931] 1 KB 148 at 153 in support of its contention that the tort of conversion involves deliberate intent. The principles concerning conversion under s 116 have been considered recently by the Full Court in Venus Adult Shops Pty Ltd and Others v Fraserside Holdings Ltd and Another [2006] FCAFC 188 ; (2006) 157 FCR 442 at [85] to [94]. At [88] the Full Court said: The essence of conversion is interference with a right of possession. It is nevertheless properly described as a ""varied and somewhat amorphous tort"" serving two distinct functions. One function is tortious, whereby it compensates a person deprived of the use of goods. However it also acts as a ""surrogate for the Roman vindicatio ; that is, in order to give a dispossessed owner the means to recover his goods in specie , or if that is not appropriate their market value"" &#8722; Tettenborn, Wiley and Bennett; The Law of Damages (LexisNexis UK, 2003) p 294. The conduct which may constitute conversion is diverse. It has been said to include: (i) refusal to return; (ii) taking; (iii) receipt; (iv) disposal or deprivation of title; (v) destruction; (vi) loss as a bailee; (vii) keeping. The diversity of that list raises questions about the universal appropriateness of a ""market value"" approach to the assessment of damages &#8722; Tettenborn A, ""Damages in Conversion: the Exception or the Anomaly"" (1993) 52 CLJ 128. Relying upon the observations in Oakley v Lyster , iiNet has also submitted that conversion is an intentional tort, and Roadshow's pleadings relating to this cause of action are thereby deficient for failing to plead this integer. Such contention raises the question whether intentional dealing with the property of Roadshow is an integral requirement of the tort of conversion. As such contention is arguable, the Court concludes that to strike out the pleading on the basis that intentional dealing is not pleaded or to arrive at an interlocutory judgment on such question is inappropriate. This issue will require detailed argument at the hearing. Paragraph 67F of the ASOC primary infringement claim In addition to Roadshow's claim that the iiNet users have infringed copyright in the films and that iiNet has authorised such conduct, Roadshow relies upon some of the same paragraphs as the conversion claim in support of a claim that iiNet itself has infringed the copyright in the films ('primary infringement'). The fact that paragraph 67F refers only to paragraph 67B(b) for such claim, together with the Amended Particulars, suggests that Roadshow alleges the primary infringement claim only arises from the data which is stored transiently in iiNet's facilities and which was discussed at [46] of this judgment, and not the transmission of such data. The issues the Court has raised regarding the definition of ' infringing copy ', and whether that could apply on the facts pleaded, do not arise in relation to this claim. If it is found that there was transient storage of the whole or substantial part of the films, this may give rise to there being a ' copy ' for the purposes of s 86(c) of the Copyright Act , and consequently the problems discussed above in relation to ' electronic transmission ' do not apply. The Court finds no deficiency in the pleading of the primary infringement claim. Separate hearings The Court now considers iiNet's claim in paragraph nine of its Notice of Motion for a separate determination of the issues relating to the 86 identified films from the other films in the catalogue of Roadshow."
cited,Director-General of Social Services v Chaney (1980) 3 ALD 161,"I do not think the orders made by the Tribunal which are under challenge constitute a decision under s 44(1) of the AAT Act. The substantive application before the Tribunal was an application for review of the delegate's decision under s 13 of the Act not to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to the respondent. The right to bring the application for review is contained in s 52A of the Act. The orders of the Tribunal defer or adjourn consideration of the application for review. The orders do not amount to a final decision or determination. In accordance with well-established authority the orders therefore do not constitute a decision within s 44(1) of the AAT Act: Director-General of Social Services v Chaney (1980) 3 ALD 161 per Deane J, with whom Fisher J agreed, at 178, 180; Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (' Bond ') per Mason CJ at 335; Geographical Indications Committee v The Honourable Justice O'Connor (2000) 64 ALD 325 at 332-333.

referred to,Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67,"On the substantive issues raised in the review application under s 52(2) of the Act, it was a matter for the respondents as to whether they sought to cross-examine the appellant on his affidavits. They did not do so. The respondent's affidavits which preceded 30 March 2005 put the appellant on notice as to their case, and gave him the opportunity to respond. The judgment was made that the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 had been satisfied. The appellant has made no submission of unfairness in that regard. 78 The appellant's wish to cross-examine, in particular Ms Langford and the second respondent, related directly to the issue of solvency. To a significant degree, the learned Magistrate in fact avoided addressing contentious factual issues: he expressly assumed in favour of the appellant that the 212 shares in Manna Hill were the appellant's shares; he also disregarded the costs liability arising from the costs order following the outcome of the earlier proceedings. 79 The assessment of the appellant's debts as being between $75,000 and $100,000 was made, as the reasons for judgment show, upon the basis of the Statement of Affairs and the appellant's evidence (as distinct from his submissions) about that. The O'Riley 'debt' was about $12,000, so the reduction from the debts listed in the Statement of Affairs having regard to the appellant's evidence was of the order of $32,000-7000. That did not involve any assessment of the respective claims of the appellant and Ms Langford as to the amount of his debt to her; the disputed evidence was referred to and the Magistrate simply observed that the indebtedness is somewhere between $15,000 (the appellant's figure) and $67,000 (Ms Langford's figure). The reasons do not suggest an amount greater than $15,000 was taken into account. The learned Magistrate has therefore, on that contested evidence, taken the view based upon the appellant's own material. In that circumstance, he did not deprive the appellant of a fair trial by not permitting the appellant to cross-examine Ms Langford. There was no benefit to the appellant in him doing so, as the cross-examination would have legitimately sought to have the Magistrate accept the fact as to the amount of the indebtedness which the Magistrate assumed in any event."
cited,Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [1999] FCA 867 ; (1999) 164 ALR 203,"According to TPI, it was on the basis of the applicant's written submissions that it prepared its own written submissions to meet the applicant's assumed case. However, on the morning of the hearing on 26 March 2008, senior counsel for the applicant, without any prior warning to the other parties or the Court, abandoned the issue estoppel argument. Instead, TPI submitted, the applicant reformulated its case in oral argument and put it on two quite different bases. The applicant relied firstly on what senior counsel for the NCC had said to Kenny J when her Honour delivered judgment in Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [1999] FCA 867 ; (1999) 164 ALR 203. Secondly, it relied on what was said to be the proper construction of the declaratory orders thereafter made by her Honour . 7 TPI says that the applicant's case before me was conducted on this new basis and that the evidence and written submissions of all parties were thereafter rendered almost entirely irrelevant. Moreover, further written submissions were required to be filed by all parties in response to these newly identified issues. It is for that reason that TPI claims that it should be fully indemnified for the substantial costs that it incurred in preparing to meet a case that was commenced, particularised and articulated in written submissions, but then abandoned without warning on the morning of the hearing. TPI accepts that the costs of the hearing itself, and the supplementary submissions that it had to file to meet the applicant's new case, should be ordered against the applicant on the usual party-party basis. 8 In the alternative, TPI submits that the applicant's issue estoppel case was always clearly foredoomed to fail. Logically, the res judicata point had to fail as well once issue estoppel was abandoned since the latter, so it was said, was a necessary condition for the existence of the former. 12 The applicant argues that the issue regarding the construction of Kenny J's orders was always part of its case and did not involve a newly identified issue. It refers to correspondence from its solicitors to the NCC in which the solicitors referred to the NCC being ""bound"" by Kenny J's orders. Its own outline of submissions plainly flagged the construction argument by referring repeatedly to the actual terms of her Honour's orders. The issue regarding the construction of those orders was intertwined with whether res judicata was applicable. 13 The applicant concedes that it abandoned issue estoppel. However, it submits that this is not a sufficient basis for ordering indemnity costs. If it were, indemnity costs would be ordered routinely and parties and their legal advisers would be tempted to pursue all issues to judgment rather than face the prospect of indemnity costs for abandoning an issue no longer regarded as tenable. The applicant says that the abandonment of issue estoppel should not be taken as a concession that the doctrine had been unreasonably or improperly raised. 14 The applicant says that its res judicata claim was not one that had no chance of success, a point amply illustrated by the detailed treatment I gave this claim in my reasons for judgment. Nor was the issue estoppel claim necessarily foredoomed to fail. Indeed, the fourth undertaking proffered to the Full Court made express reference to a possible contention that Kenny J's orders gave rise to an issue estoppel. This was said in response to concerns expressed by Goldberg J that an issue estoppel might arise. 15 Finally, the applicant says that another factor weighing against TPI's application for indemnity costs is that it sought, and obtained by consent, leave to be joined as a respondent to the proceeding in circumstances where the NCC was a perfectly able contradictor and TPI made many submissions that duplicated those of the NCC. 19 The applicant's additional submission based upon counsel's ""assurance"" to Kenny J at the time her Honour delivered judgment had to be addressed, as indeed it was. However, the failure of this point should be the subject of an order for costs on a party and party basis, and does not warrant an order for indemnity costs. 20 For these reasons, I will order, as foreshadowed, that the applicant pay the respondents' costs, to be taxed in default of agreement. There will be no order for indemnity costs. I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.

cited,Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341,"Notwithstanding the circumstances in which the orders were made, on 14 July 2008 the unusual course of permitting cross-examination was again raised with Counsel for the Applicants and, more relevantly, Counsel for Mr Kiriakidis. Reference was made to the observations of Menzies J in Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341. Counsel for Mr Kiriakidis requested, and was granted, a short adjournment to obtain further instructions in light of reference being made to the unusual course being pursued. The cross-examination thereafter continued without any submissions being advanced on his behalf. As events unfolded, it was probably the only effective means whereby the Applicants could have exposed what they believed were inadequacies in the existing discovery as provided particularly by the Fourth Respondent. As a result of the cross-examination, the Applicants were proved right. An order requiring a further affidavit to be filed in respect to particular documents, without knowledge of the manifest deficiencies in the existing discovery, may well have proved as ineffective as the discovery previously provided. 51 At least two observations need to be made. 52 First, some evidence given during cross-examination was that documents had been destroyed. As explained by Mr Kiriakidis, the destruction of documents occurred by reason of either: &#8226; such records as had been kept by Mr Kiriakidis being stored in boxes in a room behind a caf&eacute; where he was then residing, and being thrown out when he was in Greece for a period of six months from July 2006 to January 2007. The owner of the premises was said to have thrown out the boxes when Mr Kiriakidis did not return after what was expected to be only a three month visit; and &#8226; such other records as may have been maintained being routinely destroyed by employees, upon instructions, at the conclusion of every two week period. Mr Kiriakidis explained his concern as to whether or not the business was illegal and that he did not want records being maintained in such circumstances. Whether or not there was a basis for those concerns was not an issue pursued by Counsel for the Fourth Respondent during his cross-examination. It is a matter, however, which it is expected will emerge as an issue to be resolved at the final hearing."
considered,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592,"The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who claimed to fear persecution from the Awami League by reason of his involvement in the Bangladesh National Party (""BNP""). He also claimed to fear persecution from Jamat e-Islam which continued to harass people opposed to its fundamentalist beliefs and against whom no protection would be afforded. The written submissions advanced by the appellant rely largely on principles set out in the High Court decision in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592. 3 That case dealt with the question of procedural fairness. The High Court observed that an applicant is entitled to assume that issues which a delegate considered critical are the relevant issues which arise when the decision comes under review. In the absence of any indication by the decision-maker in the Tribunal to the contrary, the Court at [35] said that: '... unless some other additional issues are identified by the tribunal ... it would ordinarily follow that, on review by the tribunal, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant.' 4 In that case at [47] the Court noted that there should be an indication by the Tribunal sufficient to show that what an appellant says in support of the application is in issue. While it is not necessary to spell out all the matters which concerned the Tribunal, where there are specific aspects of an account that the Tribunal considers may be important to the decision and which may be open to doubt, the Tribunal must at least ask the applicant to expand on those aspects and explain why his or her account should be accepted. 5 The appellant says that this was not done in this case. I have considered the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and the transcript and other documents included in the appeal papers and, having regard to the transcript in particular and to the letter sent to the appellant by the Tribunal, I consider that the appellant was sufficiently alerted, from the manner and content of the questioning, the information sought and the reasons given for seeking that information, to the issues of concern to the Tribunal member. When the matter came on for hearing the appellant was invited to make any further oral submissions but, albeit understandably in the absence of any legal representation, was either unable or did not want to do so. The critical issue which was raised was whether the appellant had any past or present association with the BNP or any political party. The Tribunal was not satisfied on the material. In relation to other matters there are comments and reasons given and conclusions reached in relation to the appellant's overall credibility which are adverse to the appellant. 6 In my view and on my reading of the material I am not persuaded that there has been any reviewable error shown in the reasoning of the Tribunal, or in the approach taken by it in conducting the hearing and eliciting information, or informing the appellant of the matters which were in dispute. I note that in the notice of appeal the two grounds raised both depend on the decision in SZBEL . In the circumstances of this case, the reasoning underlying the principles expressed in SZBEL is not applicable because sufficient opportunity was given to the appellant to expand on those aspects in relation to which his case was rejected. 7 Accordingly, my conclusion is that since there was no error in the decision of the Tribunal and consequently no error in the decision of the Magistrate, the appeal is dismissed with costs.

followed,Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 685 ,"Mr Bromwich relied upon Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd v Nixon [1999] FCA 1281. In that case, a Full Court of this Court held at [17]: The general principles governing an application for a stay pending the determination of an appeal or application for leave to appeal are not in doubt. The party seeking a stay must demonstrate a reason, or an appropriate case, to warrant the exercise of a discretion in his or her favour. This requirement is not satisfied by the mere filing of an appeal or an application for leave to appeal: Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 685 (CA), at 694. The Court has a discretion whether or not to grant the stay, and if so, as to the terms that will be fair. In the exercise of the Court's discretion, it weighs consideration such as the balance of convenience and the competing rights of the parties, in particular whether prejudice will be caused by reason of the grant or withholding of a stay: Alexander, at 694; Jennings Constructions Ltd v Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 84 ; (1986) 161 CLR 681 (Brennan J), at 685. Within this framework, the Court exercises a broad discretion, and the party seeking a stay does not have to establish ""special"" circumstances: Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corporation (1996) 67 FCR 65 (FC), at 66, per Burchett J. In general, a party which has succeeded at the trial is entitled to the benefit of a judgment and thus to commence with the presumption that the judgment is correct: Powerflex, at 66. The question on the present application is how these principles apply to the unusual circumstances of the present case. 47 Mr Bromwich also placed reliance upon Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 685 in support of two particular submissions made by him as follows: (a) a stay will be granted if, unless it is granted, the appeal will be nugatory there is no basis for that conclusion in this case; (b) although courts will not generally speculate about the appellant's prospects of success, this does not prevent some preliminary assessment about whether the applicant for the stay has an arguable case, a consideration which is protective of the judgment creditor where it may be plain that an appeal has been lodged without any real prospect of success and simply in the hope that of gaining a respite against immediate execution upon judgment. Mr Bromwich submitted that the appellants had poor prospects of success on appeal. 48 Mr Bromwich also directed some attention to the financial position of APIR. He submitted that the financial position of APIR was not such as to give confidence that it was going to be, or remain, in a position to meet the requirements of his Honour's orders. 49 There did not appear to be much dispute between the parties as to the principles which govern the present case. 50 Order 52 r 17 provides a specific basis upon which a stay pending appeal may be granted."

Accordingly, Gyles J did not proceed with the hearing but ordered that s 78B notices be served ( Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 835 (' Priestley ') at [3]). 3 Mr Priestley challenges the constitutional validity of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') and O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules which was made in furtherance of that section. Mr Priestley's primary submission is that the judges of the Federal Court were influenced by Parliament to replace the former test in the Federal Court Rules of ""no reasonable cause of action"" made, he says, under the Court's inherent jurisdiction, with the statutory test contained in s 31A, thereby compromising the independence of the Court. 4 On 11 June 2008 the constitutional issue was listed for hearing on 16 July 2008, before me. On 14 July 2008 Mr Priestley sent a letter to my Chambers requesting that the hearing be ' adjourned for a time and date to be determined by the Federal Court '. The basis for this request was ' the commencement of proceedings in the High Court ' for an order to show cause. I declined to adjourn the hearing and the matter came before me on 16 July 2008. 5 Mr Priestley presses his application for an adjournment, on the basis that he has filed an application in the High Court. That application relates to his objection to any judge of the Federal Court, or any judge that participated in the making of O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules , sitting on his matter. The application to the High Court also relates to the decision of Stone J in Priestley not to recuse herself. Mr Priestley has joined me as a defendant in the High Court proceedings, filed before the first return of these proceedings before me, on the basis of bias and/ or reasonable apprehension of bias. 6 The respondents neither consent to nor oppose the application for adjournment. Although proceedings have been filed in the High Court, no application has been made to remove this matter to the High Court. The proceedings are before me for hearing. The Court has set aside the time for that hearing and the parties are present. The respondents are represented by counsel and solicitors. I see no sufficient reason to adjourn the matter because Mr Priestley has brought an application in the High Court. That application relates, in part, to a prior aspect of these proceedings, specifically Stone J's refusal to recuse herself, and an anticipatory claim concerning me. 7 The application for an adjournment is refused. 8 Mr Priestley has made four applications that I recuse myself from hearing the matter."

Section 42(1) of the Postal Services Act 1975 (Cth) gave the Commission power to appoint persons as officers for the purposes of the Act. Section 42(2) provided that a person should not be appointed unless the Commission was satisfied, after the person had undergone a medical examination required by the Commission, as to his health and physical fitness and that he possessed such educational qualifications, or met such other requirements (if any) as were required by the Commission. The Commission dismissed Ms Dao and the other appellant from temporary employment, and refused them permanent employment, because in their medical examinations they failed to attain a specified minimum body weight determined by reference to their height and sex according to a scale prepared and used by the Commonwealth Department of Health. The Commission determined on this basis that they did not possess the standard of physical fitness required. The appellants complained before the New South Wales Equal Opportunity Tribunal that they had been discriminated against on the ground of their sex, contrary to s 25(1) of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW). The High Court held that the ss 25 and 113 of the State Act (which empowered the Tribunal to award damages and reinstatement) would result in ""a clear usurpation ... of the responsibility resting on the Commission under the Commonwealth Act"" and were ""clearly in collision with s 42 ... and must therefore, by force of s 109 of the Constitution , give way.""

A State law which takes away the right is inconsistent because it is in conflict with the absolute right and because the Commonwealth law relevantly occupies the field. So also with a Commonwealth law that grants a permission by way of positive authority. The Commonwealth legislative intention which sustains the conclusion that the permission is granted by way of positive authority also sustains the conclusion that the positive authority was to take effect to the exclusion of any other law. Again it produces inconsistency on both grounds: cf. Airlines of New South Wales Pty. Ltd. v.

cited,Goldman v Hesper [1988] 1 WLR 1238,"submitted that this Court should hold that there has been no imputed waiver because the Commonwealth has made no attempt to identify why it would be unfair or inequitable for AWB to maintain privilege in the underlying investigations. This submission immediately raises the question unfair or inequitable to whom? I doubt that any question arises of fairness to the Commission it is an arm of the executive government charged with the investigation of specified matters. Nor does any question arise of fairness to the Commonwealth. Fairness presupposes a balancing of interests between parties who are in dispute. In that context, partial disclosures raise a question of fairness because there is the capacity to mislead one party to the dispute to his or her detriment. These concepts do not translate easily to the present case: cf McHugh J in Mann at 40 [127]-[128]. There is also the difficulty that, outside the framework of an inter partes dispute, fairness is truly a term of 'indeterminate reference': Mann at 40 [129] per McHugh J, citing RJ Desiatnik, Legal Professional Privilege in Australia , 1999, p 122. 133 Mann anticipated that there will be cases in which considerations of fairness have little or no role to play. This is such a case. The broad question posed by Mann is whether, and to what extent, AWB's disclosures are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the documents which are at issue in these proceedings. This question wraps up several subsidiary issues, in particular whether AWB's disclosures involved, on each occasion, a disclosure of the gist or substance of its legal advice, whether AWB consciously deployed that advice so as to advance its own commercial or other interests, and, if so, whether that disclosure has resulted in an imputed waiver of privilege over any and what associated materials. In any application of Mann , the starting point must be an analysis of the disclosures or other acts or omissions of the party claiming privilege that are said to be inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the privileged material: see Rio Tinto at [45]. The disclosures in question here were made variously to the IIC, to the Australian Government, to the Commission and in some instances via the procedures of the Commission to the public at large. In my opinion, there is no reason why these disclosures cannot support a finding that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated material. AWB submitted that imputed waiver cannot arise in the context of a commission established under the RCA. Alternatively, it submitted that the coercive and inquisitorial context in which the alleged waiver has taken place is an important factor which strongly militates against waiver. These submissions ignore the voluntary disclosures that AWB made to the Australian Government. In any event, I am not persuaded that AWB's disclosures to the Commission and the IIC are incapable of giving rise to an imputed waiver. Leaving aside any question of waiver, AWB was entitled to maintain legal professional privilege in the course of proceedings before the Commission and, by and large, it sought to do so. To the extent that AWB has already produced documents to the Commission containing legal advice or instructions, it did so because it recognised that actions it had taken outside the Commission had the consequence of waiving privilege over those documents. As for the oral evidence that the Commonwealth now relies upon, Lindberg, Cooper and Scales were senior executives of AWB when they gave that evidence to the Commission. There is nothing before me to suggest that they were not speaking as executives of AWB when they gave their evidence, or that their evidence fell outside the scope of their authority from AWB. Further, their evidence was given in the presence of AWB's legal representatives, without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. Lindberg, Cooper and Scales may have been compelled to give evidence at the Commission, but they were under no compulsion to reveal the gist or substance of legal advice that had been obtained by AWB. In these circumstances, I infer that the relevant evidence given by Lindberg, Cooper and Scales was given with the authority or acquiescence of AWB. I also infer that AWB was content for the evidence to be given at public hearings of the Commission, having regard to its own commercial interests. The evidence before me makes it clear that AWB was concerned to defend its integrity and commercial reputation in the course of the Commission's hearings. I infer that AWB made the assessment that it would advance its commercial interests if it were to be known publicly that it had undertaken extensive legal reviews and that, as a result, it had obtained legal advice that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any improper or unlawful conduct in breach of the United Nations' sanctions. AWB was content for information of this character to be disclosed publicly in relation to both Project Rose and Project Water. It would, of course, be a different case if the documents and information that the Commonwealth relies upon were disclosed under legal compulsion. On any view, the fact that documents and information were disclosed under compulsion would be very relevant to the question whether the person claiming privilege had engaged in inconsistent conduct. There is, moreover, authority to the effect that a production of documents or evidence under compulsion will not result in any waiver of privilege: Goldman v Hesper [1988] 1 WLR 1238 ( 'Goldman' ); Trans America Computer Co Inc v IBM Corporation 573 F2d 646 (9 th Cir 1978) ( 'Trans America' ) at 651. AWB's disclosures to the IIC were not made under legal compulsion. They were made by choice under a confidentiality regime negotiated by AWB. The Memorandum of Understanding between AWB and the IIC provided that AWB could withhold documents from the IIC on grounds of commercial sensitivity or legal professional privilege, or if there was a risk that AWB, its officers or employees would be exposed to breaches of Australian law. It also provided that any interviews conducted by the IIC of AWB officers or employees could be undertaken in the presence of a personal legal counsel and/or up to two representatives of AWB. AWB thereby retained the right to object to any question that intruded into areas protected by legal professional privilege. On the evidence before me, including in particular the various briefings which Hargreaves gave to the Australian Government, it is clear that AWB decided that it needed to cooperate, and be seen to cooperate, with the IIC so as to retain the support of the Australian Government and to protect and defend its commercial reputation. I do not agree with AWB's submission that, even if its disclosures were not compelled by law, the inquisitorial context in which they took place is a factor which strongly militates against waiver. In Australia, legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right that can be asserted outside the context of adversarial litigation. It can, for instance, be invoked to resist the production of documents in answer to a search warrant or the giving of information or the production of documents pursuant to coercive statutory powers or notices: Daniels at 552-553 [9] [11] and 563 [44]; Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52. As legal professional privilege can be invoked outside the context of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, logic suggests that it should be capable of being waived if the claimant engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect. It should not matter whether the conduct takes place within, or outside, the framework of the proceedings or investigatory process in which a demand has been made for the production of privileged documents or information. The crucial question is whether the conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. The disclosure of privileged communications to a third party can result in an imputed waiver of privilege, even if there is no intention of waiving privilege and the disclosure is for a limited and specific purpose. In Mann , the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory conveyed legal advice, on a confidential basis, to a member of the Territory's Legislative Assembly to enable him to consider the reasonableness of the Government's decision to settle certain legal proceedings. The majority decision turned on the fact that the disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly was not regarded as disclosure to a third party. In their joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said at 15 [35] that: 'The purpose of the privilege being to protect the Territory from subsequent disclosure of the legal advice it received concerning the litigation instituted by the appellant, there was nothing inconsistent with that purpose in the Chief Minister conveying the terms of that advice, on a confidential basis, to a member of the Legislative Assembly who wished to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the Territory in relation to the litigation.' However, their Honours also observed that, while the voluntary disclosure of privileged legal advice to a third party will not necessarily waive privilege, it can do so. They said that Goldberg v Ng illustrates that, depending on the circumstances, the disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party for a limited and specific purpose, and on terms as to confidentiality, can have the consequence of waiving privilege. McHugh J dissented. In his view, any disclosure of privileged material to a third party who is a stranger to the privileged relationship (ie to a person who is not the lawyer or the client) should have the consequence that privilege in that material is waived as against the world: at 34 [108], 37-38 [118], 42 [133]-[134]. As I read his Honour's judgment, the key reason why his Honour preferred a bright line rule of this kind is that it would ensure that legal professional privilege was not extended beyond the rationales that support it (at 37 [117]-[118]): 'Ensuring candid communications between a lawyer and a client is unlikely to be endangered if a privilege holder is held to waive privilege because he or she has voluntarily disclosed the communication to a stranger. Whether the communication will be disclosed in the future to a stranger to the privilege is entirely within the control of the client. At that stage, the client will determine whether his or her interests are best served by retaining the privilege or disclosing the communication. But it is difficult to see how the possibility of voluntary disclosure will prevent the client being candid with his or her lawyer. ... A client who voluntarily discloses privileged information to a stranger to the privileged relationship has made a choice, based no doubt on considerations personal to him or her, that the purpose for which the communication is disclosed to the stranger is more important than protecting the absolute confidentiality of the communication by preventing the stranger from having knowledge of it. The person may be encouraged to do so, as in Goldberg v Ng , by an expectation that the stranger will not further disclose the communication. But in my opinion, if privileged material is voluntarily disclosed to a stranger to the privileged relationship, the fact that it may be received under an obligation of confidence should not be relevant to whether privileged is waived.' On the facts, McHugh J considered that disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly who was not a member of the Executive Government was relevantly a disclosure to a stranger to the privileged relationship: at 44 [139]. In Goldberg v Ng , the respondents sued their solicitor, Goldberg, for failure to account for monies received and disbursed by him as their solicitor. They also made a professional conduct complaint against him to the Law Society of New South Wales. In answer to the complaint, Goldberg prepared statements, with annexures that included a draft brief to counsel, and submitted them to the Society's professional conduct department. In doing so, Goldberg told the Society that the statements and the annexures were confidential and he wished to retain his legal professional privilege in them. The Society dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no evidence of professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct. Subsequently, in the course of the Supreme Court proceedings instituted by the respondents against Goldberg, the respondents served a subpoena on the Society requiring it to produce documents relating to the complaint against Goldberg. All of the members of the High Court held that there had been no express or intentional waiver by Goldberg of his legal professional privilege in the statements and annexures. The issue that divided the Court was whether waiver should be imputed by operation of law. Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ held at 100-102 that it should because the professional complaint and the Supreme Court proceedings were but different emanations of the one dispute, and Goldberg's provision of the statements to the Society was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of demonstrating the reliability of his denial of the alleged failure to account. Their Honours analysed the issue in terms of 'fairness', but they could equally, and perhaps more appropriately, have done so in terms of inconsistency. Toohey and Gummow JJ dissented in separate judgments. Each expressed the view that waiver should not be imputed because the disclosures by Goldberg were made to a third party for a limited and specific purpose. Toohey J said at 110 that the following factors militated strongly against any implied or imputed waiver: first, Goldberg disclosed material to the Society because of a complaint against him on an undertaking by the Society that the contents would be kept confidential; secondly, the disclosure was made in the context of the Society's investigation of a complaint in pursuance of its statutory powers and, consequently, it could be regarded as having been made for the purposes of the Act; and thirdly, the disclosure was confined to the Society. Gummow J said at 123 that, as the disclosures were made in the context of compulsory statutory processes, the circumstances of the case supplied no sufficient reason for depriving Goldberg of privilege, even allowing for the advantage he sought to gain by making the disclosure. The case of Restom v Battenberg [2006] FCA 781 provides an example of a case where disclosures to a third party triggered a waiver of legal professional privilege. In the course of bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor claimed privilege over a letter that passed between his Australian and Scottish solicitors. Stone J held that the disclosure of the contents of the letter to the Scottish Employment Tribunal was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the letter and constituted a waiver of privilege. In Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd (1995) 36 NSWLR 275, which predated Goldberg v Ng and Mann , Giles J held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material, on terms of confidentiality, did not result in a loss of privilege. In Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 253, Sackville J said that it follows from Goldberg v Ng that the disclosure of a privileged communication for a limited purpose and subject to a confidentiality requirement may, or may not, amount to a waiver of privilege, depending on the circumstances of the case: at 262-263 [42]-[43]. On the facts of that case, Sackville J held that a disclosure of legal advice to the solicitors and representatives of two other companies, on strict terms as to confidentiality and for the purpose of those other companies obtaining legal advice, did not result in an imputed waiver. His Honour distinguished Goldberg v Ng as a case in which the disclosure was made to gain an advantage over the opposing party in related litigation: at 263 [45]. There are several English cases in which disclosure to a third party for a limited and specific purpose has not resulted in a loss of privilege: British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 1 WLR 1113 ( 'British Coal' ); Goldman ; and Gotha City v Southeby's (No 1) [1988] 1 WLR 1114. In British Coal , Neill LJ (with whom Stocker LJ and Dillon LJ agreed) held that the disclosure of documents by the plaintiff to the police to assist in a criminal investigation and criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege. Neill LJ said at 822: 'In my judgment the action of the plaintiff in making documents available for the purpose of the criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege to which it was entitled in the present civil proceedings. Its action in regard to both the category A and the category B documents was in accordance with its duty to assist in the conduct of the criminal proceedings, and could not properly be construed as an express or implied waiver of its rights in its own civil litigation. Indeed, it would in my view be contrary to public policy if the plaintiff's action in making the documents available in the criminal proceedings had the effect of automatically removing the cloak of privilege which would otherwise be available to them in the civil litigation for which the cloak was designed.' In Goldman , the Court of Appeal considered the effect of a statutory requirement that a claimant for costs must disclose privileged materials to the Court's taxing officers. Taylor LJ (with whom Woolf LJ and Lord Donaldson MR agreed) said that once a party puts forward privileged documents as part of his case for costs, the privilege is relaxed temporarily and pro hac vice . If the taxing officers felt compelled by natural justice considerations to disclose part or all of the contents of a privileged document to the opposite party, that disclosure would be for the purposes of the taxation only and would not amount to a waiver that prevented the owner of the document from reasserting privilege in any subsequent context: at 102. McHugh J took a stricter view in Giannarelli v Wraith (No 2) [1991] HCA 2 ; (1991) 171 CLR 592. His Honour noted that in Victoria, unlike in England, a litigant can refuse to produce documents to the taxing master on the grounds of legal professional privilege. However, McHugh J said that if the litigant choses to produce privileged documents to the taxing master, then the litigant will be taken to have waived privilege and must let the opposing parties see the documents. His Honour did not countenance any middle course under which privilege could be waived solely for the purposes of the taxation and then re-asserted in some other context: at 607. The general rule adopted in the United States is that any voluntary disclosure of privileged communications by a client to a third party breaches the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship and therefore waives the privilege, not only as to the specific communication disclosed but as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter: see Weil v Investment/Indicators Research and Management Inc 647 F2d 18 (9 th Cir 1981) at 24; United States v Aronoff 466 FSupp 855 (DC NY 1979) at 862 [9]-[10]; In re Sealed Case 676 F2d 793 (DC Cir 1982) (' re Sealed Case' ) at 809 [6] [7]; United States v AT &amp; T Co 642 F2d 1285 (DC Cir 1980) at 1299; cf Diotima Shipping Corp v Chase, Leavitt &amp; Co ., 102 F.R.D. 532 (D Me 1984); von Bulow v von Bulow , 114 F.R.D. 71 (SD NY 1987); and T Harman, Fairness and the Doctrine of Subject Matter Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege in Extrajudicial Disclosure Situations (1988) University of Illinois Law Review 999. The US courts have also considered whether a disclosure of privileged material to government investigators will have the consequence of waiving privilege. In re Sealed Case , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia considered whether a corporation that had submitted its own investigating counsel's report into alleged bribes and improper payments to the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') pursuant to voluntary disclosure programs had thereby impliedly waived its privilege over documents which were clearly identified in the report. The Court held that, by revealing part of privileged communications to the agencies to gain a commercial advantage, the corporation had made a disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. Accordingly, the Court held that the corporation had waived privilege as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter. The principle applied by the Court was that (at 818 [29]): 'Courts need not allow a claim of privilege when the party claiming the privilege seeks to use it in a way that is not consistent with the purpose of the privilege. Thus, since the purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to protect the confidentiality of attorney-client communications in order to foster candor within the attorney-client relationship, voluntary breach of confidence or selective disclosure for tactical purposes waives the privilege. Disclosure is inconsistent with confidentiality, and courts need not permit hide-and-seek manipulation of confidences in order to foster candor.' The Court rejected an argument that waiver should not be imputed because the corporation had disclosed the investigating counsel's report for specific and limited purposes only. In doing so, it declined to follow the decision in Diversified Industries Inc v Meredith 572 F2d 596 (8 th Cir 1977) ( 'Diversified Industries' ) at 611 in which the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that disclosures to the SEC under a voluntary disclosure program did not constitute a waiver to anyone but the SEC. It noted that the decision in Diversified Industries was rejected in Permian Corp v United States 665 F2d 1215 (DC Cir 1981) at 1220-1222 on the ground that it unnecessarily expanded the scope of attorney-client privilege: see also In re Weiss 596 F2d 1185 (4 th Cir 1979) at 1186. Like the District Columbia Circuit, the First, Third, Fourth, Sixth and Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal have rejected the approach adopted by the Eighth Circuit in Diversified Industries : see AM Pinto, Cooperation and Self-Interest are Strange Bedfellows: Limited Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege through Production of Privileged Documents in a Government Investigation (2004) 106 West Virginia Law Review 359, p 372; RH Porter, Voluntary Disclosures to Federal Agencies Their Impact on the Ability of Corporations to Protect from Discovery Materials Developed During the Course of Internal Investigations (1990) 39 Catholic University Law Review 1007, pp 1029-1052. The US courts have accepted that there will be no imputed or implied waiver of privilege if the disclosure of the privileged material is involuntary and compelled by law: see eg Trans America. The Canadian courts apply a waiver test that is based on considerations of fairness and consistency: see S &amp; K Processors Ltd v Campbell Ave Herring Producers Ltd (1983) CPC 146 (BCSC) at 150; Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v Canada (Director of the Canadian Museum of Nature) [1995] 3 FC 643 ; British Columbia (Securities Commission) v BDS (2000) BCJ No 2111 (BCSC), affirmed (2003) 226 DLR (4 th ) 393; and RD Manes and MP Silver, Solicitor-Client Privilege in Canadian Law , Butterworths, 1993, p 207. As in the United States, waiver will not be imputed if privileged material is produced to a government regulator under compulsion of law. Putting to one side its provision of Mr Tracey QC's advices and instructions and its briefings to the Australian Government, AWB disputed that the disclosures it made to the IIC and the Commission disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB obtained as a result of Project Rose or Project Water. It contended that these disclosures did no more than refer to the existence of legal advice, without disclosing its substance. Alternatively, AWB argued that the record of Lindberg's interview with the IIC, and the evidence given to the Commission by Lindberg, Cooper and Scales, cannot be related to any particular piece of legal advice, other than that provided by Mr Tracey QC. The applicable principles are set out in my decision in AWB v Cole at [135] [139]. The authorities draw a distinction between a mere reference to the existence of legal advice, which will not usually amount to a waiver, and cases in which the gist or substance of the legal advice has been disclosed: see Maurice at 481, 488 and 493; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd [1996] HCA 15 ; (1996) 70 ALJR 603 at 607; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 12; Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360 at 376-377; and Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 (' Bennett' ) at 104-105 [6] [9]. In Bennett , the Full Court (Tamberlin, Emmett and Gyles JJ) held that legal representatives of the Australian Customs Service had waived privilege in legal advice by stating openly that they had given advice to Customs that a particular regulation did not prohibit public comment by an officer on matters of public administration. The trial judge had held that a disclosure of the legal position or stance that a lawyer had advised a client to take was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication giving the advice. The trial judge also appeared to draw a distinction between statements which disclose the conclusion or logical result of legal advice, and statements which disclose the content of the legal advice and its reasoning: see Tamberlin J at 105 [10] and Gyles J at 118 [61]. The Full Court rejected this approach. Gyles J stated at 119 [65] that the voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made, including the reasons for the conclusion. Tamberlin J said at 104 [6]: 'In my view, it would be inconsistent and unfair, having disclosed and used the substance of the advice in this way, to now seek to maintain privilege in respect of the relevant parts of that advice which pertain to the expressed conclusion. It may perhaps have been different if it had been simply asserted that the client has taken legal advice and that the position which was adopted having considered the advice, is that certain action will be taken or not taken. In those circumstances, the substance of the advice is not disclosed but merely the fact that there was some advice and that it was considered. However, once the conclusion in the advice is stated, together with the effect of it, then in my view, there is imputed waiver of the privilege. The whole point of an advice is the final conclusion. This is the situation in this case.' Subsequently, Tamberlin J was confronted with a case that was very similar to the one he hypothesised in Bennett . In Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v NINOX Television Ltd (2005) 65 IPR 442, the applicant contended that the respondents had waived privilege in various legal advices because of the way in which the respondents had publicly referred to the advice. Tamberlin J held that there had been no waiver. He concluded that the mere assertion that advice had been taken, and the fact that action is then taken by the client, is not sufficient, unless the two are linked in such a way that it is apparent that the advice is that specified action should be taken. His Honour also made the following observations at 446-447 [26]: 'Whilst I accept that, in some circumstances, a clear disclosure of the ""bottom line"" of the advice, and the course of conduct taken thereafter, may be sufficient to amount to waiver of legal professional privilege, I do not think these matters have been established in the present case. On a fair and reasonable reading, the statement to the effect that senior counsel had been engaged and that he had reviewed matters in detail and that steps were being taken based on his recommendations is not sufficient to amount to a waiver of the legal advice. The substance or content of the advice is not disclosed with specificity or clarity. Questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree and, in this instance, I am not persuaded that the conduct, assertions or admissible evidence are sufficient to warrant the necessary implication that legal professional privilege has been waived.' The principles discussed in Bennett were applied in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 12 ) [2006] FCA 348. The issue was whether a statement in a discovered document that '[o]ur legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against Optus is low' had the consequence of waiving privilege in the legal advice that it referred to. Sackville J held that it did; the statement voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice: at [12]. In Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 224 ALR 299, the Commissioner of Taxation filed particulars with the Court stating that the Commissioner would be relying on specified grounds 'which have been confirmed by Senior Tax Counsel... and supported by AGS... and opinions obtained from counsel'. The taxpayer contended that the Commissioner had thereby waived privilege in the legal advice of the Australian Government Solicitor and the opinions of counsel. Sundberg J held that these references voluntarily disclosed the conclusion or substance of the advice and consequently privilege had been waived. Sundberg J's decision went on appeal to the Full Court, but the Full Court's decision turned on the alternative ground of issue waiver: Rio Tinto at [72]. The Full Court considered that, in the particulars, the Commissioner had made an assertion that put the contents of the documents containing legal advice in issue, or necessarily laid them open to scrutiny, with the consequence that there was an inconsistency between the making of the assertion and the maintenance of the privilege. AWB submitted that the reasoning in Bennett was unsound, particularly the holding that the disclosure of the conclusion stated in legal advice will amount to a waiver of the whole of the advice. AWB did not refer to any authorities that supported this submission and I reject it. In my view, it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of the gist, substance or conclusion of legal advice will amount to a waiver in respect of the whole of the relevant advice. ASSOCIATED MATERIAL Turning to the scope of any imputed waiver, it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of privileged documents can result in a waiver of privilege over those documents and associated material. The test applied to determine the scope of any waiver of associated material is whether the material that the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the same issue or subject matter: Maurice at 482 and 484 per Gibbs CJ, 488 per Mason and Brennan JJ, and 498 499 per Dawson J. In Maurice , Gibbs CJ said at 482: '... Similarly, where a party disclosed a document which contained part only of a memorandum which dealt with a single subject-matter, and then read the document to the judge in the course of opening the case, it was held that privilege was waived as to the whole memorandum: Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co . In that case Templeman LJ said: "" ... the rule that privilege relating to a document which deals with one subject matter cannot be waived as to part and asserted as to the remainder is based on the possibility that any use of part of a document may be unfair or misleading, that the party who possesses the document is clearly not the person who can decide whether a partial disclosure is misleading or not, nor can the judge decide without hearing argument, nor can he hear argument unless the document is disclosed as a whole to the other side. Once disclosure has taken place by introducing part of the document into evidence or using it in court it cannot be erased."" The same test must be applied in deciding whether the use in legal proceedings of one document impliedly waives privilege in associated material. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation [No 2] Mustill J dealt with this question and suggested the following test: "" ... where a party is deploying in court material which would otherwise be privileged, the opposite party and the court must have an opportunity of satisfying themselves that what the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the issue in question. To allow an individual item to be plucked out of context would be to risk injustice through its real weight or meaning being misunderstood.""' Dawson J discussed the authorities at 498-499: 'In Geo. Doland Ltd v Blackburn Robson Coates &amp; Co waiver of privilege with respect to a conversation between solicitor and client, which took place before litigation was contemplated, was held to extend to any other communications in relation to the subject-matters of the conversation, although the implied waiver was held not to cover similar documents which came into existence for the purpose of prosecuting the litigation. This decision was not followed in General Accident Corporation Ltd v Tanter where a distinction was drawn between the waiver of privilege before a trial and the further waiver of privilege by calling evidence in a trial. In the latter situation the waiver was held to extend to the transaction constituted by the privileged communication but not to the subject-matter of that communication arising upon other privileged occasions. General Accident Corporation Ltd v Tanter has been criticized for the distinction which it draws between waiver by the tender of evidence of a privileged communication and waiver by the disclosure of the communication in some other way and for the restriction which it places upon the extent of associative waiver: see Phipson on Evidence , par 15-20. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation [No 2] , a broader view was taken by Mustill J that "" ... where a party chooses to deploy evidence which would otherwise be privileged the court and the opposition must, in relation to the issue in question, be given the opportunity to satisfy themselves that they have the whole of the material and not merely a fragment"". This view was approved by the Court of Appeal in Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co . In the United States it has been widely held that voluntary disclosure of the content of a privileged attorney communication constitutes waiver of the privilege with respect to all other such communications upon the same subject-matter: Weil v Investment/Indicators, Research and Management and the cases there cited; Diotima Shipping Corp v Chase, Leavitt &amp; Co ; United States v Aronoff ; In re Sealed Case .' AWB relied upon the way in which the principle was formulated by the Court of Appeal in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell [2002] VSCA 197 ; (2002) 7 VR 524 at 564 [121] : 'A reference in one letter of advice to an earlier letter of advice does not expose the latter to scrutiny by the other party to litigation merely because legal professional privilege is waived in relation to the former: implied waiver is not so generous a doctrine. As we apprehend it, where legal professional privilege is waived in relation to one piece (or part) of advice, the privilege is impliedly waived in relation to another if - and only if - that other is necessary to a proper understanding of the first. As established by the High Court (at least since Mann v. Carnell ) the test in such cases is whether it would be ""inconsistent"" for a party to rely upon, and so to waive legal professional privilege in respect of, the one without also being taken to have waived privilege in respect of the other.' It is no doubt correct that a mere reference to the existence of legal advice in a disclosed document will not be regarded as a waiver of its contents, albeit a different conclusion would follow if the gist, substance or conclusion of the legal advice is voluntarily disclosed. But, with great respect to their Honours, the proposition concerning waiver of associated material is expressed too narrowly and in a way that is not consistent with the test propounded by the High Court in Maurice . The principle propounded by the Court of Appeal may work adequately enough in some circumstances, particularly where privilege is sought to be maintained over one part of a single piece of legal advice, but in other circumstances it will not give effect to the principles explained in Maurice. A common application of associated material waiver relates to the case where an expert report has been prepared in reliance upon other documents. In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Southcorp Ltd (2003) 46 ACSR 438 at 441-442 [21], Lindgren J summarised the applicable principles: '1. Ordinarily the confidential briefing or instructing by a prospective litigant's lawyers of an expert to provide a report of his or her opinion to be used in the anticipated litigation attracts client legal privilege: cf Wheeler v Le Marchant (1881) 17 Ch D 675; Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1979) 36 FLR 244 at 246; Interchase Corp Ltd (in liq) v Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd (No 1) [1999] 1 Qd R 141 (Interchase) at 151 per Pincus JA, at 160 per Thomas J. 2. Copies of documents, whether the originals are privileged or not, where the copies were made for the purpose of forming part of confidential communications between the client's lawyers and the expert witness, ordinarily attract the privilege: Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 (Propend)...; Interchase , per Pincus JA; Spassked Pty Ltd v Cmr of Taxation (No 4) (2002) 50 ATR 70 at [17]. 3. Documents generated unilaterally by the expert witness, such as working notes, field notes, and the witness's own drafts of his or her report, do not attract privilege because they are not in the nature of, and would not expose, communications: cf Interchase at 161-2 per Thomas J. 4. Ordinarily disclosure of the expert's report for the purpose of reliance on it in the litigation will result in an implied waiver of the privilege in respect of the brief or instructions or documents referred to in (1) and (2) above, at least if the appropriate inference to be drawn is that they were used in a way that could be said to influence the content of the report, because, in these circumstances, it would be unfair for the client to rely on the report without disclosure of the brief, instructions or documents; cf Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 481... per Gibbs CJ, CLR 487--488... per Mason and Brennan JJ, CLR 492-493... per Deane J, CLR 497--498... per Dawson J; Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83 at 98... per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, CLR 109... per Toohey J; Instant Colour Pty Ltd v Canon Australia Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 870... ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Lux Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 89... at [46] . 5. Similarly, privilege cannot be maintained in respect of documents used by an expert to form an opinion or write a report, regardless of how the expert came by the documents; Interchase at 148--150 per Pincus JA, at 161 per Thomas J. 6. It may be difficult to establish at an early stage whether documents which were before an expert witness influenced the content of his or her report, in the absence of any reference to them in the report: cf Dingwall v Commonwealth of Australia (1992) 39 FCR 521; Tirango Nominees Pty Ltd v Dairy Vale Foods Ltd (No 2) (1998) 83 FCR 397 at 400;... ACCC v Lux at [46].' In Thomas v New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 380 (' Thomas' ), McClellan CJ at Common Law applied these principles to the documents which underpinned or supported the advice of counsel. His Honour stated at [17]: 'Although in the present case the primary document for which privilege was expressly waived was the advice of counsel, I can discern no difference in principle between such an advice and the advice or report of an expert retained for the purpose of the litigation. As I have indicated, I am satisfied that counsel relied upon instructions which they were given and, it would appear, relied upon medical reports in a way which influenced the content of the advice which they gave. Accordingly, insofar as there are documents which were relied upon in the preparation of the advice falling within categories 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the notice to produce, the service of the affidavit impliedly waived privilege in those documents.' Later at [20] his Honour said: '... In the present case the plaintiff disclosed the advice in these proceedings for the purpose of obtaining whatever assistance he could from that advice in pursuit of his claim. To my mind, that disclosure waived his privilege both in the advice itself and the documents which were used by counsel and which influenced the content of the advice. Waiver having occurred, the fact that the advice was not ultimately tendered is, to my mind, not relevant. Having sought an advantage, the plaintiff was bound by the course he had taken and accordingly is amenable to producing the relevant documents in response to an appropriate notice to produce.' In Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited v Commonwealth (1993) 40 FCR 507, French J applied the principle of associated material waiver in a case where one joint venturer disclosed significant elements of legal advice it had obtained in relation to mining leases held by the joint venture partners. His Honour held that the disclosure brought about an implied waiver of other legal advices obtained by the other joint venturers in relation to the mining leases. His Honour said at 509 that it was significant that the disclosures were made for the benefit of the joint venture as a whole and, although there was no direct evidence on the point, he considered that it was difficult to imagine that the disclosures would have occurred against the wishes of the other joint venturers or indeed without their consent. In England, the principle has been applied to documents which underpin or support expert evidence: see Dunlop Slazenger International Ltd v Joe Bloggs Sports Limited [2003] EDWCA Civ 901; Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd v Debiopharm SA [2006] EWHC 164 (Pat); and L'Oreal SA v Bellure NV [2006] EWHC 1503 (Ch). Several English cases illustrate the practical operation of the principle. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation (No 2) [1981] Com LR 138 (' Nea Karteria' ), a lawyer gave evidence that he had conducted an interview on the basis of a list of questions prepared by the plaintiffs' lawyers. While privilege was waived with respect to the witnesses' answers, the plaintiffs sought to maintain privilege with respect to the list of questions: at 139-140. Mustill J (as his Lordship then was) held at 140 that privilege over the list of questions had been waived by implication: 'It seems to me that the written questions were, so to speak, part of the meeting. They were in a sense an agenda for the meeting. They formed the basis for one-half of the exchange between the lawyer and [the witness]. Evidence to that effect having been given by the lawyer, it seems to me that privilege must have been waived for those questions. And I think the interests of justice, which I believe to underlie the authorities on this part of the case, demand that the opposition and the court should have an opportunity to satisfy itself as to the accuracy of the evidence given to the lawyer as to the way in which he conducted the interview.' Mustill J drew a distinction at 140 between the instructions to the lawyer who carried out the questioning and the questions themselves; the instructions did not play a part in the meeting, did not form part of the body of events upon which the Court had to reach conclusions of fact, and were merely part of the prior history of those events. In R v Secretary of State for Transport; Ex parte Factortame (1997) 9 Admin LR 591 at 599, Auld LJ made the following observations concerning the application of the test stated in Nea Karteria : 'Much depends on whether the party making partial disclosure seeks to represent by so doing that the disclosed documents go to part or the whole of an ""issue in question"", the expression used by Mustill, J in the passage from his judgment in Nea Karteria that I have cited. The issue may be confined to what was said or done in a single transaction or it may be more complex than that and extend over a series of connected events or transactions. In each case the question for the court is whether the matters in issue and the document or documents in respect of which partial disclosure has been made are respectively severable so that the partially disclosed material clearly does not bear on matters in issue in respect of which material is withheld. The more confined the issue, for example as to the content of a single document or conversation, the more difficult it is likely to be to withhold, by severance, part of the document or other documents relevant to the document or conversation.' In Fulham Leisure Holdings Ltd v Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones [2006] 2 All ER 599 (' Fulham' ) at 604 [11], Mann J suggested that it was helpful to approach the application of the test stated in Nea Karteria in three steps: first, identify the transaction in respect of which the disclosure has been made; secondly, ascertain from the nature of the disclosure or other evidence whether the transaction is wider than an advice given on a single occasion, if so, the whole of the wider transaction must be disclosed; and thirdly, the disclosure of the whole transaction may make it plain that further disclosure is necessary to avoid unfairness or misunderstanding of what has been disclosed. Mann J added at 607 [18] that once the transaction has been identified the cases show that the whole of the material relevant to that transaction must be disclosed. It is not open to a waiving party to say that the transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose; the court will determine objectively what the real transaction is so that the scope of the waiver can be determined. His Lordship also said that the application of these principles will be very fact sensitive and will vary from case to case: at 607 [19]. WAIVER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED At [70] to [126] above, I set out my findings as to the precise terms in which AWB disclosed the results of its legal reviews and legal advice it had obtained to the Australian Government, the IIC and the Commission. Overall, I am satisfied that by means of these disclosures, AWB deployed the gist or substance of legal advice it had obtained. Moreover, I am satisfied that AWB made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice in its dealings with the Australian Government, the IIC and the Commission because it considered that it was in its commercial interests to do so. These actions are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the legal advice. Having regard to the nature, purpose, terms and extent of its disclosures, I am also satisfied that AWB acted inconsistently with the maintenance of confidentiality over the associated material which underpinned the legal advice. While these overall conclusions are relevant and important, I have taken the view that it is necessary and appropriate for me to make specific findings as to the nature and consequences of each such disclosure. I turn to that task. In his various statements to the Australian Government, Hargreaves did not merely refer to the existence of legal advice. Nor did he simply disclose the legal advice which had been obtained by AWB from Mr Tracey QC. He described in some detail the findings and conclusions that had been arrived at by AWB's own legal review. In my opinion, Hargreaves thereby disclosed to the Australian Government the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB had obtained (as at the relevant dates at which he made his disclosures) that there was no evidence of: &#8226; corruption by AWB &#8226; side payments or after sales payments by AWB to the former Iraqi regime &#8226; any knowledge on the part of AWB that Alia was connected with the Iraqi regime or that payments were being channelled by Alia to that regime &#8226; any conduct by AWB that resulted in breaches of the United Nations' sanctions &#8226; any other wrongdoing or improper conduct by AWB in connection with the supply of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme. When Hargreaves gave his briefings to officers of the Australian Government, he expressed himself in terms that were apt to refer, and which a reasonable listener would have understood as referring, to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that AWB had received as at the date of the relevant briefing. Hargreaves would not have been understood as referring only to a particular piece of historical advice, regardless of whether it was overtaken, or qualified, or supported by later advice. His assertions purported to represent the current state of affairs. Hargreaves' memorandum of 25 June 2005 makes it quite clear that his statements to the Australian Government were based upon all of the legal advice AWB had obtained, and not simply the advice it had obtained from Mr Tracey QC. It cannot be disputed that Hargreaves disclosed the substance of the legal advice which Blakes provided to AWB's board on 25 May 2004. AWB has already formed that view and acted on it by producing Blakes' power point presentation to the Commission. But in my view the consequence of Hargreaves' disclosures cannot be confined to Blakes' advice of 25 May 2004 and Mr Tracey QC's advices. Through the remainder of 2004 and until Hargreaves had his last meeting with Ms Carayanides in the period between 16 June 2005 and September 2005, Hargreaves met with Australian Government representatives several times and continued to make assertions that AWB's independent legal review had not identified any wrongdoing by AWB. The evidence shows that Blakes and Minters continued the legal review in 2004 and 2005 and provided ongoing legal advice to AWB. It is not open to a waiving party to say that the disclosures relate simply to one advice and not others, or that the relevant transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose; the Court will determine objectively what has been disclosed: see Fulham at 607 [18]. Hargreaves' memorandum of 25 June 2005 makes it plain that he deliberately deployed AWB's legal advice in his dealings with the Australian Government. He did so as part of AWB's strategy to secure the continued support of the Federal Government, both generally and in relation to AWB's dealings with the IIC and the United States Government. Hargreaves also deployed the advice in pursuit of the objectives that he set out in his memorandum; they included protecting and defending the reputation of AWB both within Australia and overseas, and minimising any attack by US wheat interests on AWB's position as the exclusive manager of wheat exports from Australia. Given these strategic objectives, it was important for AWB to disclose, indeed to stress, that it had conducted an extensive independent legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by AWB in connection with its exports of wheat to Iraq. By disclosing its legal advice to secure these objectives, AWB assumed the risk that it would be held to have waived legal professional privilege in connection with legal advices it obtained in the course of the legal review. Having regard to the legal principles governing waiver, I consider that any legal advice that AWB obtained from Blakes or Minters prior to Hargreaves' last meeting with Ms Carayanides on any of the subject matters, or relating to any of the issues, described at [180] above, has been waived by reason of the disclosures made by Hargreaves. Those subject matters and issues are wide enough to encompass the Tigris transaction and the iron filings claim. If AWB obtained legal advice during this period on those subject matters, or relating to those issues, from persons other than Blakes or Minters such as ABL, Mr Tracey QC or others, that advice has also been waived by Hargreaves' disclosures. I am satisfied that the disclosures to the IIC involved a disclosure by AWB of the gist or substance of legal advice that it had obtained by 28 February 2005. The disclosure occurred at two points. First, when Lindberg was interviewed on 28 February 2005, the interview took place in the presence of AWB's legal representative. AWB had the ability to object to any statements by Lindberg that intruded into areas covered by legal professional privilege. No objection was raised to Lindberg's statement that the legal review conducted by Cooper had found nothing that would substantiate claims of fraud or corruption by AWB or payments by AWB to individuals in the Government of Iraq. Secondly, AWB was directly involved in providing the record of interview, as revised by Lindberg and AWB's lawyers, to the IIC. In my opinion, the record of interview describes the gist or substance of legal advice which AWB had obtained as a result of its legal review. As with Hargreaves, Lindberg's assertions purported to describe the current state of affairs, ie, as at 28 February 2005. There is no reason to read his assertions as if they were confined to legal advice obtained from Mr Tracey QC. It extends, in my view, to any legal advice obtained by AWB from Blakes, Minters and Mr Tracey QC, and any advice from others, prior to 28 February 2005 that deals with the same subject matters or relates to the same issues as the advice that Lindberg described. I am satisfied that the disclosures to the IIC were made deliberately and consciously by AWB with a view to obtaining a finding from the IIC that AWB had not engaged, or at least had not knowingly engaged, in conduct that involved making payments to the Iraqi regime in breach of the United Nations' sanctions. Lindberg and AWB went out of their way to stress that the company had undertaken a legal review which had found nothing to substantiate claims of fraud, corruption or improper payments to the Iraqi regime. The disclosures were made with the knowledge and intention that they would be referred to by the IIC in its final published report. Accordingly, I find that AWB consciously and voluntarily deployed its legal advice with the object and intention of furthering the company's commercial and other interests. AWB contended that the disclosures which Lindberg made at his meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 4 October 2005 were confined to the advice given by Mr Tracey QC. This is a possible interpretation of the Department's minute, but in my view Lindberg's statements are not to be read, and would not have been understood, so narrowly. Later in the meeting, Lindberg said that AWB had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime and that this had been supported by legal advice. This statement was expressed broadly and was not confined to 'independent legal advice'. In my view, Lindberg disclosed, and a reasonable listener would have understood that Lindberg was disclosing, the gist or substance of all of the legal advice that AWB had obtained up to 4 October 2005 in relation to the question whether AWB had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime. The disclosure extends to Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of advice dated 22 September 2005 and Professor Wippman's advice dated 27 September 2005. At the meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lindberg, Stewart and other representatives of AWB were providing AWB's answer to the IIC's draft findings, as communicated to AWB in the IIC's letter of 26 September 2005. The minute shows that AWB's representatives were very concerned to explain AWB's claims of innocence and to secure the Government's ongoing support. Lindberg told the meeting that the IIC had ignored AWB's explanations and that the so-called evidence relied on by the IIC did not support its factual findings. In support of these contentions, Lindberg asserted that AWB had legal advice confirming that AWB had not acted in contravention of the sanctions regime. I infer that AWB made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice at the meeting with the Minister so as to secure the ongoing support of the Australian Government. In doing so, it assumed the risk of any consequential waiver of legal professional privilege. In my opinion, Blakes' presentation to AWB's board on 25 May 2004 constituted legal advice for the purposes of the doctrine of legal professional privilege. AWB withdrew its claim of privilege and produced the complete presentation to the Commissioner in April this year. The presentation not only discloses the substance of the legal advice from Blakes, but also some of its detail and foundations. In my opinion, one consequence of this disclosure is that AWB has waived privilege over any other legal advice that it obtained prior to 25 May 2004 in relation to the same subject matters or the same issues as Blakes addressed in its presentation. AWB contends that Lindberg's evidence to the Commission on 17 January 2006 did not disclose the gist or conclusion of any legal advice. I disagree. In my opinion, it disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB had previously obtained as to whether AWB had engaged in conduct in breach of the United Nations' sanctions and whether AWB had paid inland transportation fees to Alia as a conduit for the payment of money to the Iraqi regime. In the course of his evidence, Lindberg went out of his way to assert that the legal review that Cooper had instituted, assisted by external legal advisers, had reported periodically and did not find any evidence to substantiate the allegations that AWB had made payments in breach of the sanctions. In one instance at least, Lindberg's assertions to this effect were not directly responsive to the question asked of him by counsel assisting the Commission. Lindberg gave these answers in the presence of counsel for AWB without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. I am satisfied that, by means of this evidence, AWB voluntarily deployed the legal advice that it had obtained prior to 17 January 2006. I infer that it did so because it considered it was in its interests for it to be publicly known that AWB had conducted an extensive legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing. In his evidence, Lindberg specifically referred to a series of periodical reports from those undertaking the legal review: 'there were a number of reports, and the findings of those reports are recorded in the minutes and the basis of those findings has been communicated in letters that have been sent to the government and elsewhere'. I find that in his evidence to the Commission Lindberg was referring to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that AWB received during the course of the internal review as periodical reports were made to the boards of AWB and AWBI. It follows, in my view, that Lindberg's evidence has the consequence that AWB has waived privilege over any legal advice that it obtained in the course of the review that goes to the same subject matters, or relates to the same issues, as the legal advice that Lindberg described in the course of his evidence. In relation to Mr Tracey QC's advices, AWB produced his written advices of 8 June 2004, 31 March 2005 and 12 August 2005 to the Commission early in April 2006. In my view, the consequence of this production is that AWB must be taken to have waived legal professional privilege in any other legal advices that it obtained prior to Mr Tracey QC's last advice of 12 August 2005 in relation to the same subjects or issues. As already mentioned, I also consider that, quite separately, AWB has waived privilege over the advice it obtained from Mr Tracey QC on 22 September 2005 in relation to Resolution 661. As a result of the Project Water investigations, the directors of AWB obtained legal advice from Cooper at the board meeting on 14 December 2004 that the Tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches of law. A handwritten note of that advice has been produced to the Commission. AWB was entitled to claim that this note was protected from production to the Commission by legal professional privilege. It did not claim privilege. I infer that it did not do so because it wanted it to be known publicly that AWB had advice as of 14 December 2004 to the effect that the Tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches by AWB. Having disclosed the gist or substance of its legal advice in this manner, it would be inconsistent to allow AWB to maintain confidentiality and privilege in any other legal advices that AWB obtained prior to 14 December 2004 dealing with the same subject matter or the same issues. The advice that Cooper gave to AWB's board on 14 December 2004 related specifically to the Tigris transaction. However, I consider that the other disclosures that I have already discussed were expressed in such broad terms that they encompassed any advices concerning the Tigris transaction and/or the iron filings claim. As a result, I consider that there has been a waiver of other advices about the Tigris transaction, such as Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of 26 October 2004 (document 353A). The cumulative effect of AWB's disclosures is that, down to 17 January 2006 when Lindberg gave evidence to the Commission, AWB was openly claiming that its legal advice showed that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with its supply of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme, including wrongdoing of the kind described at [180] above. I find that AWB made these claims to advance its commercial interests. AWB's conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in any advices dealing with the same subjects or issues. In addition, Lindberg, Cooper and Scales gave evidence to the Commission that AWB obtained legal advice that the proceeds of the inflated prices in contracts A1670 and A1680 should be disbursed to Tigris to the extent of approximately US$7 million. That evidence was given in the presence of AWB's legal representatives without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. Again, I infer that AWB was content for it to be publicly known that it had obtained that legal advice. Having disclosed the gist or substance of that advice, AWB is bound to disclose any other legal advices it obtained in relation to the same subject or same issue. AWB's revised list of privileged documents contains several advices relating to the Tigris payment. They include documents 337 and 385. Documents 1088, 1089, 1092, 1093 and 1094 record the substance of those advices in minutes of meetings held by the AWB and AWBI boards in December 2004 and February 2005 and the chairman's running sheets for the February 2005 meetings. The evidence which Lindberg, Cooper and Scales gave in public before the Commission is inconsistent with AWB's attempt to maintain privilege in these documents. One question which remains to be dealt with is whether the scope of the waiver that must, in my view, be imputed to AWB is to be confined to any other legal advice that AWB obtained prior to the date of the relevant disclosures that addressed the same subject matters or issues as the advice that AWB voluntarily disclosed. In my opinion, the waiver is not so confined. It extends to the documents and information which were taken into account in formulating, or which otherwise underpinned or influenced, the legal advice that AWB has chosen to disclose. The Commonwealth argued that AWB's disclosures are broad enough to encompass any legal advice which AWB obtained, and any documents which AWB's lawyers reviewed or created, in the course of the Project Rose and Project Water investigations. The difficulty with this way of approaching the boundaries of the waiver of associated material is that the terms 'Project Rose' and 'Project Water' have an indefinite and imprecise ambit. According to the authorities discussed above, the limits of any waiver of associated material depend upon the nature of the advice that has been disclosed, what was represented by means of the disclosure, and the character of the transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice. Regard must also be had to the way in which AWB's legal advice was described in the various disclosures. Essentially, by means of the disclosures, AWB was asserting that a detailed legal review had been undertaken, and that it had concluded that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing or other improper conduct by AWB in connection with its sale of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme. In my opinion, the nature and character of this disclosure is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in those documents which were taken into account by AWB's legal advisers in arriving at the advice they gave. To adapt the language used by McClellan CJ at Common Law in Thomas at [17] and [20], AWB's disclosures of its legal advice effect a waiver of privilege in the documents which were reviewed for the purposes of that advice or which influenced its content. Furthermore, AWB emphasised the breadth of its internal review in its various disclosures. In my view, AWB thereby waived privilege in documents which define the scope of the review or which reveal what investigations were in fact undertaken in the course of the review. Much the same answer follows if one asks what was the legal exercise or transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice: see Factortame at 598-599; and Fulham at 604 [11] and 607 [18]. Having regard to the form of the legal advice disclosed by AWB, the relevant legal exercise or transaction encompassed a review of original documents and witness interviews, as well as summaries, chronologies or other analytical documents prepared by the lawyers, with a view to determining whether there was any improper or wrongful conduct by AWB. Material of this kind underpinned or influenced the legal advice which AWB has chosen to disclose, and it is not severable from that advice. There is a certain symmetry in defining the boundaries of the waiver of associated material in this way. Documents brought into existence in the course of a lawyer's factual investigation are, prima facie, capable of attracting legal professional privilege where the investigation is being undertaken for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice. If the client voluntarily discloses the gist or substance of the legal advice that is founded upon such investigations, the rationale for according privilege to the investigative material will have disappeared. While I would go further, the approach that I have described is not unlike the approach that AWB has already taken in connection with the production to the Commission of Mr Tracey QC's memoranda of advice and instructions. In the case of Mr Tracey QC's oral advice of 25 May 2004 and his confirmatory memorandum of 12 August 2005, AWB determined, correctly in my view, that the underlying documents supplied to Mr Tracey QC must also be produced. AWB considered that the form of Mr Tracey QC's advice (ie there was no evidence of wrongdoing) meant that it was impossible to separate his legal advice from the copy documents that were supplied to him as part of his instructions. The evidence before me does not reveal whether AWB adopted the same approach to Mr Tracey QC's advice of 31 March 2005. When he was asked to provide this advice, copy documents were supplied to Mr Tracey QC as part of his instructions but there is no evidence, one way or the other, as to whether those copy documents have been produced to the Commission. The substance of Mr Tracey QC's advice was that nothing in the documents supplied to him as of 31 March 2005 had caused him to vary his earlier advice of 25 May 2004. This advice cannot be separated from the documents that were supplied to him and, accordingly, AWB's express waiver of privilege in his advice extends to all of the documents and instructions supplied to him. The applicable principle can also be illustrated by reference to the advice that Blakes gave in its presentation of 25 May 2004. The advice that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by AWB that involved a breach of the United Nations' sanctions was explicitly founded upon a review of a large number of documents and interviews of AWB personnel. Having regard to the form of its advice, it is impossible to separate Blakes' advice from the underlying documentation and interviews. However, the witness interviews and other materials that Blakes relied upon to formulate its advice have not been produced to the Commission and are still the subject of claims for legal professional privilege. In my opinion, those claims of privilege are not maintainable; privilege has been waived by (inter alia) the production of Blakes' advice. The same approach must be adopted to any advices that Blakes provided after 25 May 2004 on the question whether any evidence had emerged of any wrongdoing or improper conduct on the part of AWB. Another question which remains to be dealt with is the extent of any waiver that arises from AWB's production to the Commission of the instructions to Sir Anthony Mason. In its particulars setting forth its objections to AWB's privilege claims, the Commonwealth contended that these disclosures had brought about a waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to Project Rose. It tendered the instructions which ABL provided to Sir Anthony Mason on 16 September and 20 October 2005 and the expert opinion which Sir Anthony Mason provided dated 24 October 2005. However, the Commonwealth did not direct any submissions to this aspect of its waiver case, either orally or in its written submissions. Nor did AWB address any oral or written submissions to the consequences which flowed from its production to the Commission of the instructions to, and the advice obtained from, Sir Anthony Mason. It must be borne in mind that AWB is seeking a declaration that all of the documents set forth in its revised list of privileged documents are the subject of legal professional privilege. These documents include documents by which AWB obtained legal advice both in Australia and in the United States concerning the applicability of Resolution 661. The instructions to Sir Anthony Mason summarised the gist or substance of the very same legal advice. In these circumstances, I have concluded that the Court must take account of the evidence that has been placed before it. By disclosing the instructions given to Sir Anthony Mason, AWB has in my opinion disclosed the substance of legal advice it had obtained, as at 20 October 2005, both in Australia and in the United States, as to the applicability of Resolution 661. This disclosure encompasses Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of 22 September 2005 and Professor Wippman's advice of 27 September 2005. Thus far, I have identified the principles which define the boundaries of the waiver that is to be imputed to AWB, including the boundaries of any waiver of associated material. The remaining task in disposing of the waiver arguments is to determine precisely what documents fall within these boundaries. I have carried out that task by inspecting the documents over which claims of privilege have been made, reviewing the evidence concerning each document, and applying the principles identified above. As a result, I have determined that AWB has waived any legal professional privilege that would otherwise attach to the documents as listed under the heading 'Conclusions' below. THE IRON FILINGS CLAIM Communications between a lawyer and client which facilitate a crime or fraud are not protected by legal professional privilege. This principle is often referred to as the 'fraud exception' to legal professional privilege, but this does not capture its full reach: Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500 (' Kearney' ) at 515; Propend at 546; Clements, Dunne &amp; Bell Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (2001) 188 ALR 515 (' Clements' ) at 521-522 [30]. The principle encompasses a wide species of fraud, criminal activity or actions taken for illegal or improper purposes: see North J's review of the authorities in Clements at 522-526 [35]-[44]. The scope of conduct caught by the principle has been articulated in a variety of ways, often without particular precision: Propend at 545. Classic formulations have spoken of communications in furtherance of a 'crime or fraud': R v Cox and Railton (1884) 14 QBD 153 (' R v Cox' ) at 165; a 'criminal or unlawful proceeding': Bullivant v Attorney-General (Vic) [1901] AC 196 (' Bullivant' ) at 201; 'any unlawful or wicked act': Annesley v Anglesea (1743) 17 St Tr 1139 at 1229; and 'all forms of fraud and dishonesty such as fraudulent breach of trust, fraudulent conspiracy, trickery, and sham contrivances': Crescent Farm (Sidcup) Sports Ltd v Sterling Offices Ltd [1972] Ch 553 at 565. In Kearney , the High Court applied the principle to deny legal professional privilege to legal advice obtained by the Northern Territory Government which was prima facie a 'deliberate abuse of statutory power' to defeat a land claim under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth). In his reasons for judgment, Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason and Brennan JJ agreed) stated at 515 that 'legal professional privilege will be denied to a communication which is made for the purpose of frustrating the processes of the law itself, even though no crime or fraud is contemplated.' Some authorities have expressed the principle as applicable to prevent a 'fraud on justice' in a broad sense. The concept of a 'fraud on justice' was adopted by Lander J in Gartner v Carter [2004] FCA 258 (' Gartner v Carter' ) to deny protection to a communication between a lawyer and client for the purpose of the client putting assets beyond the reach of the legitimate claims of secured creditors: at [130] and [139]-[140]. The principle extends to 'trickery' and 'shams'. A 'sham' refers to steps which take the form of a legally effective transaction but which the parties intend should not have the apparent, or any, legal consequences: Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471; see also Beazley v Steinhardt (1999) 106 A Crim R 21; affirmed on appeal in [1999] FCA 1255 (' Beazley' ). The recent case of Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Mercorella (No 3) [2006] FCA 772 provides an example of the denial of legal professional privilege to documents in furtherance of a sham transaction. In that case, creditors of a managed investment scheme claimed privilege over documents relating to securities obtained from the defendant and certain companies in the scheme. The transactions were allegedly entered into so as to advance those creditors' interests over the interests of other creditors to the scheme. Mansfield J found that the communications were prima facie in furtherance of a sham and, as such, were not privileged. After referring to Lander J's decision in Gartner v Carter and Barclays Bank plc v Eustice [1995] 4 All ER 511 (' Barclays Bank '), his Honour stated at [95]: 'It is a short step from those decisions to the present facts, as prima facie found. The [creditors] engaged in the transactions reflected in the Deed, and the granting of the securities within the structures it created, to secure or advance their interests over others who had advanced money to [the first defendant] or to the Scheme. There is a prima facie case that the ""restructure"" of the advances so that they appear as advances to the partnership of Ajay and Opey is a sham.' Mansfield J drew a distinction at [96]-[100] between communications to obtain advice in relation to what, if anything, could lawfully be done to improve the prospects of being repaid or of obtaining the interest to which the client was entitled (which were privileged), and communications which have the effect of concealing the true nature of a transaction and which enable a client to present a picture which is not true (which were not privileged). Where a client is engaged in fraudulent conduct, communications with his or her lawyer in furtherance of the fraud are not privileged, regardless of whether the lawyer is a party to the fraud or not: Clements at 562 [213]. The principle applies to communications passing between a client and lawyer where the lawyer is innocent of the fraud or improper purpose: R v Bell; Ex parte Lees [1980] HCA 26 ; (1980) 146 CLR 141 at 145. Further, the fraud need not be that of the client or the lawyer; it may be that of a third party: Capar v Commissioner of Police (1994) 34 NSWLR 715; R v Central Criminal Court; Ex parte Francis &amp; Francis [1989] AC 346, cited with approval in Clements at 562-565 [217]-[218]. It is important to bear in mind that the fraud exception is based on public policy grounds. The principle is sufficiently flexible to capture a range of situations where the protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client would be contrary to the public interest: see Kearney at 514-515; R v Cox at 614. This aspect of the principle is reflected in the statement that '[t]he privilege takes flight if the relationship between lawyer and client is abused': Clark v United States (1933) 289 US 1 at 15; see also Kearney at 514 and 524. In Barclays Bank , communications between the client and his lawyer in relation to the setting up of transactions at an undervalue so as to prejudice the bank were held to be 'sufficiently iniquitous for public policy' to require those communications to be discoverable. Schiemann LJ (with whom Aldous and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed) stated at 524: 'If that view be correct, then it matters not whether either the client or the solicitor shared that view. They may well have thought that the transactions would not fall to be set aside ... either because they thought that the transactions were not at an undervalue or because they thought that the court would not find that the purpose of the transactions was to prejudice the bank. But if this is what they thought then there is a strong prima facie case that they were wrong. Public policy does not require the communications of those who misapprehend the law to be privileged in circumstances where no privilege attaches to those who correctly understand the situation.' For the principle to apply, there must be more than a mere assertion or allegation of fraud or impropriety: Bullivant at 201, 203 and 204-205. In Propend at 514, Brennan CJ expressed the test as being one of 'reasonable grounds for believing' that the relevant communication was for an improper purpose. The requirement has also been described as one of a 'prima facie case': Butler v Board of Trade [1971] 1 Ch 680 (' Butler' ) at 689; cf Baker v Evans (1987) 77 ALR 565 at 574. In Kearney at 516, Gibbs CJ approved the test formulated in O'Rourke v Darbishire [1920] AC 581 at 604, namely that 'there must be something to give colour to the charge'; 'the statement must be made in clear and definite terms, and there must further be some prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact'. The High Court in Propend applied this test: at 514 per Brennan CJ, at 521 per Dawson J, 534 per Toohey J, 546 per Gaudron J, 556 per McHugh J, and 592 per Kirby J. It is not necessary to prove an improper purpose on the balance of probabilities. The 'prima facie' test arguably reflects the fact that issues of legal professional privilege are usually dealt with in the interlocutory stages of a proceeding, but the authorities have not departed from that formulation where a declaration is sought in relation to privilege issues: Butler ; Propend; Beazley . It must also be established, on the same prima facie basis, that the communication which is the subject of the claim for privilege was made in furtherance of, or as a step preparatory to, the commission of the fraud or wrongdoing. In Butler, Goff J found at 687 that a letter written by the plaintiff's lawyer which volunteered a warning that the plaintiff may incur serious consequences if he did not take care was not shown to be 'in preparation for or in furtherance of or as part of any criminal designs on the part of the plaintiff': see also Zemanek v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (unreported, Federal Court, Hill J, 2 October 1997). In Propend , the High Court considered whether a charge of improper purpose must be based on evidence that is admissible in the proceeding. The only evidence of alleged illegality before the trial judge in Propend was the sworn information which supported the issue of a search warrant for the relevant documents. The Court held that, while the sworn information was admissible to establish the basis upon which the warrant was issued, it was not admissible to show that the copy documents were not privileged: see at 514 per Brennan CJ, 557 per McHugh J, 576 per Gummow J, 547 per Gaudron J, and 593 per Kirby J. The iron filings claim refers to a claim by GBI for a rebate of US$2,016,133.00 on account of the fact that earlier shipments of wheat by AWB to GBI had been contaminated by iron filings. Lindberg agreed to pay this sum to GBI in settlement of the iron filings claim in about October 2002 during the course of a visit to Bagdad. An email dated 7 November 2002 from Chris Whitwell of AWB ('Whitwell') to Lindberg and others reporting on the trip to Iraq in October 2002 stated that the responsible Iraqi Minister had asked for repayment of the iron filings rebate through the 'inland transport mechanism'. The same email referred to the fact that the Iraqi Minister was seeking cabinet approval for repayment of the Tigris debt. At the outset of this case, the Commonwealth contended that any legal advice that AWB obtained in connection with the Tigris transaction was waived by virtue of AWB's production to the Commission of a partly masked memorandum of 7 February 2003 dealing with the subject of the iron filings payment and Tigris petroleum fee. On the first day of the hearing, AWB announced that it was no longer seeking a declaration of privilege in respect of documents connected with the Tigris transaction which the Commonwealth sought to challenge on the basis of the fraud exception. Subsequently, AWB made it clear that this concession did not extend to six documents relating to the iron filings rebate payment. During the course of the hearing in this Court, AWB produced an unmasked copy of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 and provided it to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth tendered the memorandum as an exhibit in this proceeding, without any objection from AWB. The memorandum contains a fairly full description of the way in which AWB planned to pay the iron filings claim to GBI. The memorandum, which was sent by Whitwell to Messrs Geary and Long, with copies to Scales, Johnson, Hogan, Johnstone, Cooper, Lyons, Hockey and Thomas, states: ' PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL This memo is in respect to refunding the Grain Board of Iraq the quality rebate of approx USD 2,016,133 through the inland transport payments for the new contract as requested by the Minister of Trade, Iraq. In addition, for the record IS &amp; M has negotiated (through an uplift in price] the recovery of a USD 8.375 million outstanding debt to Tigris by IGB through this contract. AWB will repay this debt back to Tigris less an agreed recovery fee of USD 500 K on a pro rata basis as tonnage is shipped. Overview Delegation led by Andrew Lindberg (August 2002) to Baghdad agreed to settle the contamination of the 'Iron Filings' vessels by paying them USD 6 pmt for each vessel total = USD 2,016,133 After being approached by Tigris Petroleum AWB and IGB have agreed to allow the new contract to be the conduit for a repayment of USD 8,375,000 owed to Tigris by IGB for a cargo of wheat shipped in 1996. IGB have agreed to raising the contract price by the debt amount and when payments are made under the Letter of Credit AWB will pay Tigris its debt less AWBs recovery fee. We have suggested the following during our last two visits. &#8226; Offsetting the debt against the Outstanding debt to 'Tigris petroleum' (approx USD 8.35 million) &#8226; Reducing the any new contract price [sic] by the amount of the rebate on a pmt basis &#8226; Repaying the debt through the provision of aid in some form - Wheat, Health supplies etc. However, in discussion with the Minister of Trade he has continually , insisted on repayment directly as an addition to the inland transport and said that this was his understanding of the agreement with Andrew Lindberg - Michael Long was present and confirms that this was discussed. Now that the new contract has been concluded ISM need a sign off to organise this payment when shipments start. Issues &#8226; Possible implications for AWB on a corporate governance basis ie/ direct payment to a company with links to the Iraqi regime may be construed to be in contravention of the UN Sanctions. The relevant UN Security Council Resolution is 661 (1990). This resolution provides at clause 4: ""...All States shall not make available to the Government of Iraq or to any commercial, industrial or public utility undertaking in Iraq any funds or any other financial or economic resources and shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territories from removing from their territories or otherwise making available to that Government or to any such undertaking any such funds or resources and from remitting any other funds to persons or bodies within Iraq.... except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs."" In summary, this means that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be obliged to prevent AWB Limited from making any remittance of funds to the IGB. AWB Legal opinion in this regard is set out below. This does not mean, however, that a payment might not be able to be made which will comply with the terms of the UN Resolutions. As a minimum, if AWB management determines to make the payment, then it should be made in the following circumstances: 1. The payment is made in installments over time and coincides with payments for future shipments of wheat (ie not a lump sum payment); 2. The payments preferably be made to a company other than the IGB and in a jurisdiction other than Iraq; and 3. The payments be recorded as being made as a part of a settlement reached between AWB and IGB, the terms of which contemplated that IGB would agree not to take any action against AWB for the alleged contamination of the 8 vessels in 2002 with iron filings AND would agree to enter into contracts for the purchase of Australian bulk wheat in the future in exchange for a renegotiation of the price on the 8 vessels. If we ensure that the above requirements are met, then Legal consider it will be at least arguable that we are not 'making funds or financial resources available to the Iraqi Government'. Instead, we are repaying part of the contract price for the 8 vessels following a re-negotiation of the sale price due to a downgrading of the grain (which potentially contained iron filings). In addition to the above the UN Security Council resolutions also require (resolution 986 (1995) clause 8) that the cost of food exports to Iraq must be met by draw down from the UN ""escrow account"". Furthermore draw down from the escrow account is only allowable under strict conditions. Those conditions include, at clause 8(a)(iii) that the goods to which payment is referable shall have arrived in Iraq. In this case, the goods have already arrived in Iraq and HAVE been paid for in full. However, the Resolutions are SILENT on the procedure for any repayment of part of the price in circumstances where there has been a quality complaint (and a subsequent renegotiation of price). This may therefore give us more scope to make the repayment to IGB. Even if we make payment as outlined above, there is still a risk that the Australian Government and/or the United Nations will take a contrary view on the interpretation of the above mentioned resolutions and declare that AWB has breached the terms of those resolutions by making the payment. This is a commercial and political issue, which AWB's management will need to consider. &#8226; According to an informal discussion with DFAT any repayment of a quality rebate should be either re-payed through UN ESCROW account or as a contract price reduction however they have not had a full legal argument put in front of them or been told officially. In Public affairs opinion as long as the repayment is legal and could not be seen to be breaking UN Sanctions then we should proceed (with the proviso that we have an independent legal opinion to that effect - see above legal opinion). Public Affairs also expressed concern that this would not be well received by the UN OIP office and that there was a reasonable chance of them finding out. IS &amp; M on the other hand do not want them involved and feel confident that this issue could be handled without the need for the OIP to be consulted. It has been articulated to us and we have circumstantial evidence that other participants in the OIP program (Russian and Pakistani companies) have had to sort out quality problems in a similar way and it is unlikely either their national governments or the OIP were consulted &#8226; IS &amp; M feel strongly that a failure to repay the IGB as discussed will lead to serious consequences for AWBs relationship with the IGB. IS &amp; M also believe that failure to refund this agreed debt in this way would have serious implications for the execution of the new contracts. AWBI are aware of all the issues laid out above and in light of the commercial imperative of this situation agree with the recommendation as laid out below. They do however insist that the Managing Director is appraised of the situation. Actions Whilst IS &amp; M have received a number of different opinions from different areas of AWB and an informal opinion from DFAT we still feel this issue is a grey area with no prescriptive answers. Based on the opinions we do have and the commercial circumstances surrounding this issue IS &amp; M recommend and seek approval for the following: &#8226; IS &amp; M is to repay debt as per method outlined in AWBs legal opinion (and requested by the Minister of Trade) directly to Alia Transport in Jordan in instalments. IS &amp; M will also look to obtain written agreement from IGB to the payment in the format agreed by legal however it is not guaranteed. &#8226; Managing Director only to convey our intentions to the Australian Government at the appropriate time prior to Shipment. The timing of such a disclosure is important and we would recommend that nothing be done until at least Letters of Credit are in place for these contracts. Given that this is unlikely to happen until after a war with Iraq it may allow us a further chance of renegotiation with a new regime. &#8226; IS &amp; M to finalise as soon as possible a written agreement with Tigris with regard to the settlement of their debt.' [Original emphasis omitted] The evidence before me establishes to the requisite prima facie standard that the price in contracts A1670 and A1680 was inflated to cover both the amount of the iron filings claim and the repayment by GBI of the debt which it owed to Tigris. A surcharge of US$8.375 pmt was added to each contract in respect of the Tigris debt, as shown by an email from Nigel Edmonds-Wilson to Scales and others at AWB dated 12 December 2002. The same email shows that in each contract the inland transportation fee was set at US$51.15 pmt. At the Commission, Mr Geary of AWB gave evidence that the prices in these two contracts were inflated to cover a component for the Tigris debt and a component for the US$2 million iron filings rebate. He also said that the United Nations was not advised at any stage that the prices for wheat in these two contracts had been inflated in this way so as to cover the Tigris debt and the iron filings claim. To adopt the words of Viscount Finlay in O'Rourke , the evidence gives ample 'colour to the charge' that the prices in these two contracts were falsely misrepresented. The evidence shows that the prices in the two wheat contracts were inflated as a means of extracting money from the United Nations' escrow account. Having regard to the terms of the memorandum of 7 February 2003, there are reasonable grounds for believing that, having extracted approximately US$2 million from the escrow account to meet the iron filings claim, AWB planned to pay that money in instalments to GBI via the mechanism of inland transportation fees. The material before me, including Whitwell's email of 7 November 2002 and his memorandum of 7 February 2003, indicates clearly that AWB knew that paying inland transportation fees to Alia was a means of making payments to the Iraqi Government. This plan was concealed from the United Nations. The planned payments of the iron filings claim were never carried into effect because the invasion of Iraq intervened. Scales gave evidence to the Commission that the iron filings money has never been paid and remains in AWBI's accounts. However, the fact that the payments were never made to the GBI will not prevent the application of the fraud exception so long as there is sufficient evidence that the communications were in furtherance of, or preparatory to, the commission of the fraud or impropriety in the broad sense described above: see Butler; and Clements at 562 [213]. In my view, the evidence establishes a more than adequate prima facie case that AWB knowingly and deliberately disguised the true nature of the prices in contracts A1670 and A1680. If it be relevant, I also consider that the evidence establishes the foregoing matters on the balance of probabilities and to a level of satisfaction commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation: see Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362 per Dixon J. No question arises here of evidence which would not be admissible in a final hearing: cf Propend . AWB argued that there was no evidence that the transaction furthered any particular fraud, iniquity or illegality. It submitted that it is common ground that the United Nations' resolutions were not in terms incorporated into Australian law. AWB submitted that, consequently, the fraud exception is not available to take the documents out of the operation of the doctrine of legal professional privilege. This narrow approach is at odds with the authorities that stress the wide range of fraudulent or iniquitous activities that fall within the principle. I have inspected the six documents that were said to relate to the iron filings claim. My inspection of AWB's documents revealed a further four documents that fall within this category and are still the subject of a privilege claim. I am satisfied that these 10 documents are not privileged. The documents were, prima facie, brought into existence in furtherance of an improper and dishonest purpose, viz inflating the prices of contracts A1670 and A1680 so as to extract payments out of the United Nations' escrow account that would then be utilised, in part, to satisfy a compensation claim by GBI. Prima facie, the evidence establishes that the transaction was deliberately and dishonestly structured by AWB so as to misrepresent the true nature and purpose of the trucking fees and to work a trickery on the United Nations. It would be contrary to public policy for the privilege to enure in communications of this kind. The 10 documents in question are listed below in my conclusions. There is an alternative basis for rejecting AWB's claim for privilege over the 10 iron filings documents. AWB's disclosure of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 and its tender by the Commonwealth as an exhibit in these proceedings, without any objection or claim to confidentiality by AWB, effects a waiver over the subject matter of the legal advice set out in the memorandum. My inspection of the 10 documents relating to the iron filings claim confirms my view that those documents relate to the subjects and issues that are canvassed in the memorandum of 7 February 2003. If, contrary to my view, any privilege subsisted in any of the documents, it has been waived by AWB. When the Commonwealth tendered the unmasked version of the memorandum of 7 February 2003, I asked Mr Judd why AWB's production of that document did not waive any privilege that subsisted in documents relating to the iron filings claim. Mr Judd's response was that the Commonwealth did not put its case on that basis. I do not think that is entirely correct. In the particulars of its case, the Commonwealth contended that AWB's disclosure of the masked version of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 worked a waiver of any privilege in documents relating to Project Water and the Tigris transaction. The Commonwealth has never varied from the position that the iron filings claim was an integral part of the Tigris transaction. However, the Commonwealth did not in its closing address make any submission that privilege over the six documents had been waived by the production of the unmasked memorandum. To that extent, Mr Judd's response was correct. Despite these matters, I have concluded that the Court cannot ignore the effect of the evidence before it, especially as AWB is seeking a declaration that the 10 documents are privileged. CONCLUSIONS It is not feasible in these reasons for judgment, when so many documents are at issue, to set out separate reasons for the decision I have reached on each particular document. I have reached the conclusions set forth hereunder after inspecting all of the documents in AWB's revised list of privileged documents and by applying the legal principles and factual findings identified above. AWB has not made out its claim for privilege in respect of the following documents: 229, 245-247, 279, 280, 362B, 469A, 495, 542, 565, 586, 675, 784, 867, 872, 890AN, 1090, 1091, 1095, 1096, 1098, 1099, 1118 and 1262. These documents fall into the following categories : (a) documents for which there is no evidence of purpose to satisfy the dominant purpose test (documents 229, 469A, 542 and 565); (b) documents where the evidence does not satisfy the dominant purpose test, having regard to the nature and content of the document and the vague and formulaic evidence contained in the relevant segments of the affidavit evidence (documents 279, 280, 495, 675, 784, 867, 872, 890AN, 1095, 1096, 1098, 1099, 1118 and 1262); (c) a document that was provided to a third party and therefore was not a confidential communication for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice (document 362B); (d) documents which are partly not proven and partly waived (documents 245-247, 586, 1090, 1091 which are discussed further below). If, contrary to my view, privilege does attach to any of these documents, there has been a waiver of privilege in respect of all of them, other than documents 362B, 784, 872 and 1118. The waived documents are included in the list at [237] below. In addition, there are 10 documents relating to the iron filings claims. They are as follows: 30, 31, 32, 32A, 33, 41, 594, 595, 595A and 596. Privilege does not attach to these documents as they were brought into existence in furtherance of a fraud or other impropriety. Alternatively, any privilege has been waived by AWB. These documents are included in the list at [237] below. AWB has waived any legal professional privilege that subsisted in the following documents: 12, 301-33, 41, 56, 77-79, 81-85, 100-106, 110-117, 120-124, 126, 127, 129-132, 136, 137, 139, 140, 161, 213, 229, 235, 240, 241, 245-247, 250, 252, 253, 257-259, 263, 265-268, 271, 279, 280, 283, 284, 290, 292, 294-301, 308-310, 313, 326, 327, 330-333, 335A-342, 344, 348, 353A, 355-357, 359, 361, 362A, 365, 375, 377-380, 385, 386, 394, 422, 423, 424, 425, 432, 443, 445-449, 455, 461, 463, 465, 469A, 486, 487, 495, 507, 508, 513, 523, 524, 533, 534, 541-544, 547, 548, 553-555, 557, 563, 565, 568-579, 582-590, 592, 594-596, 599, 601-603, 675, 681, 681A, 689A, 689B, 699-704D, 704J-704P, 704T, 704X, 704AA, 704FF, 704KK, 711-715, 721, 722, 725, 729-733, 736-739, 749, 753, 755-757, 762, 771, 788, 794, 798, 815, 817, 820, 823, 824, 837, 840, 847, 867, 890AA, 890AD, 890AE, 890AH, 890AI, 890AJ, 890AK, 890AM, 890AN, 890AP, 890AQ, 1005, 1006, 1009, 1011-1013, 1025, 1026, 1028-1030, 1032, 1033, 1051, 1056, 1059, 1070, 1088-1096, 1098, 1099, 1119- 1121, 1123, 1124, 1144-1152, 1161-1163, 1183-1187, 1221, 1222, 1262 and 1297. In broad terms, the documents over which privilege has been waived comprise documents falling within the following categories: documents which define the scope of AWB's internal review or which identify what investigations were carried out; summaries, chronologies and other documents which record or analyse the results of those investigations; witness statements and other notes or records of interviews of AWB personnel; records of meetings and periodical reports concerning the findings of the review; and documents seeking advice, or comprising or recording advice provided to AWB, as to whether AWB or any of its employees engaged in wrongdoing in connection with wheat sales to Iraq under the OFF Programme, including any wrongdoing in connection with the Tigris transaction. As I have explained, waiver does not turn on whether the documents attracted the description 'Project Rose' or 'Project Water'. On inspection, I determined that numerous documents marked 'Re: Project Rose' or the equivalent fall outside the scope of any waiver as they related to distinct matters about which AWB sought or obtained legal advice, such as the powers and jurisdiction of the PSI and IIC investigators, other US legal issues, the memorandum of understanding between the IIC and AWB, representation of AWB employees at IIC hearings, the powers of the Wheat Export Authority, and issues of directors' and officers' insurance and corporate governance. There are a number of documents where, on inspection, I have determined that the document is only capable of attracting privilege as to part (the balance of the claim for privilege not having been proved), but that such privilege has been waived. These documents require some further explanation: (a) Documents 245 and 246 are drafts of an information paper dated 13 August 2004. Document 247 substantially replicates the draft information paper in a power point presentation format. AWB claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents, as indicated on the face of the documents. In substance, AWB contended that these parts attracted privilege because they recorded legal advice. On inspection I concluded that the claim is not established in respect of the first part of the documents. I have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but AWB has waived privilege in respect of that second part. (b) Document 586 is a table of various legal advices in the possession of Blakes. AWB contended that the table recorded legal advice. On inspection I concluded that this claim is not sustainable , save for the entries listed at 23, 24 and 25 of the table which disclose the substance of legal advice given by Mr Tracey QC. I have determined that AWB has waived privilege in respect of entries 23, 24 and 25 of the table. (c) Documents 1090 and 1091 are, respectively, the minutes of AWB and AWBI board meetings dated 22 February 2005. AWB claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents, as indicated on the face of the documents. It contended that these parts recorded legal advice. As to the first part claimed, this is not borne out by my inspection. I have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but AWB has waived privilege in respect of that second part. There are also a number of documents which I have determined to be privileged only as to part of the claim made by AWB. After inspecting the documents and applying the principles I have discussed, I have determined that certain parts of the documents are privileged, while privilege in another part or parts of the documents has not been proved or it has been waived. It is necessary to deal with each of these documents: (a) Document 138 contains three pages of handwritten file notes. Privilege has not been established in respect of the first page of the document. If (contrary to my view) privilege is attracted, it has been waived. Privilege is established in respect of the second page of the document. Privilege has not been established in respect of the third page of the document; or if privilege is attracted, contrary to my view, it has been waived. (b) Document 251 is a document consisting of a number of entries in a spreadsheet. AWB claims privilege in certain parts of the document, as indicated on the face of the document. AWB has waived privilege in respect of the parts claimed on pages 367, 368, 380, 390, and the first of the two parts claimed on each of pages 388 and 395. The page numbering refers to the system that AWB has adopted for its document control purposes. Otherwise, the document attracts privilege to the extent claimed. (c) Document 376 is a handwritten file note headed 'Iraq Report for JIS'. I have determined that the document attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document that relates to the Tigris transaction, namely the second entry commencing with the words 'completion of Iraq mkt. access arrangements' and concluding with the words 'confirm there is compliance'. (d) Documents 503, 520, 522, 526, 527 and 965 contain various drafts of a briefing paper initially prepared by ABL. I have determined that each of the documents attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of each document under the headings 'Legal Review' and 'Key Messages'. (e) Document 516 is another draft of the briefing paper referred to in the preceding subparagraph. I have determined that the document attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document under the heading 'Legal Review'. (f) Document 691 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal AWB employees and external lawyers. AWB said that the document attracted privilege in part. Dr Fuller gave evidence that it recorded legal advice of Leonie Thompson. I have determined that the passage on page 028 of the document opposite the entry 'Leonie T' is privileged. As to the remainder of the document, it does not record any legal advice and is not privileged. (g) Document 696 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal AWB employees and external lawyers. AWB claimed that the document was part privileged, and relied on Dr Fuller's evidence that it recorded legal advice given by Leon Zwier. I have determined that the passage on page 037 of the document opposite the heading 'Leon Zwier' (to the balance of the page) is privileged. Privilege has not been established in respect of the remainder of the document. If any privilege attached to the remainder, it has been waived. (h) Document 704S is a record of various matters discussed between AWB's external and internal lawyers. I have determined that AWB has waived privilege over the six lines commencing with the entry which includes the words 'iron filings case'. The balance of the document is privileged. (i) Document 704II is a handwritten record of various conversations on 20 and 28 September 2004. On the face of the document, it appears that a claim for privilege is made only over the part of the document which is dated 28 September 2004. Privilege has been established over the entry dated 28 September 2004. However the evidence of Ms Peavey in relation to document 704II addresses the entry of 20 September 2004. If privilege is claimed over the part of the document which is dated 20 September 2004, it has not been established. (j) Document 1097 is the minutes of a meeting of the AWB and AWBI joint board committee. There are two parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made on the ground that they record legal advice. On inspection I determined that the part of the document consisting of the first bullet point under the heading 'Project Rose' is privileged. However, privilege has not been established over the third bullet point. If privilege is attracted over that part of the document, it has been waived. Document 1297 is a redacted copy of an email from Cooper to Lindberg and Scales, copied to Quennell, dated 16 November 2004. It appears that the redactions mask those parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made. Prima facie, the document appears to be within the scope of the waiver I have identified and applied in these reasons for judgment. However, I propose to invite further submissions from the parties as to whether document 1297 is in contest and, if so, I will direct that an unredacted version of the document be filed with the Court for its inspection. As for the remaining documents, AWB has in some instances claimed privilege over the entire document and in other instances it has only claimed privilege over a designated part or parts of the document. AWB has established that legal professional privilege attaches to the following documents to the extent claimed by it: 20, 21, 55, 89-98, 107, 108, 119, 133, 135, 143-146, 150-152, 154-160, 162-190, 194, 196, 197, 199-201, 204-211A, 215, 217-222, 224-228, 230-234, 237-239, 254-256, 260-262, 264, 269, 270, 273-278, 281, 282, 285, 286, 288, 293, 302-306, 311, 315-324, 334, 343, 345-347, 349-353, 354, 358, 362, 368, 374, 381, 382, 384, 387, 388-393, 395, 398-408, 410, 412-414, 416-421, 423A, 426-428, 430, 431, 433-442, 444, 450-454, 456, 457, 459, 460, 462, 464, 465A, 467, 468, 470-473, 475-485, 488, 490-494, 496-502, 504-506, 509, 510, 514, 515, 517-519, 521, 525, 529, 530, 536-540, 549-552, 556, 558-562, 564, 566, 567, 581, 591, 593, 600, 605, 671, 672, 673A, 679, 694, 696A, 704E 704I, 704Q, 704R, 704U-704W, 704Y, 704Z, 704BB-704EE, 704GG, 704HH, 704JJ, 706-710, 724, 727, 740-745, 747, 748, 751, 752, 754, 758-761, 763-766, 768-770, 772, 773, 775, 777, 779-781, 785, 787, 790, 792, 797, 799-802A, 804, 806-814, 816, 818, 819, 821, 822, 826-831, 835, 849-852, 856, 857, 860, 861, 863, 865, 866, 868-870, 873, 876, 877, 879, 881-883, 885, 887-889, 890AB, 890AC, 890AG, 890AIA, 890AL, 890AR-AZ, 890BA-890BG, 937AJ, 937AP, 942, 947, 948, 950-953, 956-964, 966, 970-992, 994, 995, 997, 998, 1000-1004, 1071, 1073-1081, 1082A, 1083, 1086, 1087, 1112-1113A, 1114-1117, 1118A, 1152A, 1155, 1158-1160, 1190, 1195, 1196, 1200, 1206, 1213-1215, 1218, 1225, 1226, 1229, 1231, 1232, 1234, 1237, 1239, 1240, 1243, 1246-1250, 1252, 1255, 1256, 1260, 1261, 1293 and 1299-1301. COPY DOCUMENTS AWB has filed a list of duplicate privileged documents. The list is Exhibit JM5 to the affidavit of John Mitchell sworn 28 July 2002. Each document in the list is a duplicate of an identified document in AWB's list of privileged documents. The duplicates fill 17 lever arch folders. AWB has sought a declaration that the documents in this list are, or record, confidential communications that are protected from production to the Commissioner by legal professional privilege. At the hearing, neither AWB nor the Commonwealth directed any substantive submissions to the status of these duplicate documents. In its written submissions, AWB referred to the principles enunciated in Propend as to the circumstances in which a copy of an unprivileged document can itself attract legal professional privilege. In those written submissions, AWB contended that the qualification which Brennan CJ expressed in Propend at 512 does not represent the law. The Chief Justice's qualification was that if the original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or it is not produced, and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is available to prove the contents of the original document, then privilege cannot be maintained over the copy. However, AWB did not make any submissions as to how, or why, this qualification might be relevant to its claims. AWB adopted the position that the status of the duplicate documents depends on my decision as to the status of the corresponding original document. The Commonwealth did not make any submission to the contrary at the hearing, although its written submissions contended that AWB had failed to identify the purpose for which particular duplicates were created, or to establish that they were kept confidential. It would seem a harsh result if AWB were to lose the benefit of privilege in original documents simply because it has not explained or is unable to explain the circumstances in which copies were made. In large organisations and within law firms, it is hardly unexpected that multiple copies of privileged documents will be brought into existence and that, long after the event, it may be difficult to adduce evidence as to the circumstances in which the copies were made. The submissions of the parties were so cursory that I did not gain any meaningful assistance from them. However, I have reached the following conclusions. Where I have held that specified original documents do not attract legal professional privilege, no case has been made out that duplicates of those documents are entitled to privilege. Where I have held that specified original documents attract legal professional privilege, I have concluded that privilege attaches to the duplicates. The duplicates come from the custody of AWB, and there is nothing to suggest that the duplicates were dealt with, or communicated, in ways that would deny the privilege claim. Furthermore, the material before me does not identify any specific grounds for concluding that the duplicates do not attract privilege. A number of documents in AWB's revised list of privileged documents are said to be duplicates of other documents in the list. There is no evidence as to some of those documents (documents 291, 307 and 580) and others have been removed (documents 26 and 1031). Consequently, I have not made any findings about those documents; it is unclear whether they remain in contest. It is necessary to make specific reference to a number of other duplicate documents in the list: (a) Document 582 is a copy of document 140. I have determined that AWB has waived any privilege attaching to the documents. (b) Document 998 is a copy of document 995 and document 1001 is a copy of part of document 1000. I have determined that the originals are privileged. For the reasons given at [247] above, privilege attaches to the copy documents. (c) Document 1006 is said by Chesterman to be a copy of document 1005. My inspection of the documents has revealed that this is not the case. There is therefore no evidence capable of supporting the claim for privilege in respect of document 1006. However, even if there were evidence that document 1006 attracted privilege, I am satisfied that AWB has waived the privilege. RELIEF I have determined that specified documents are not the subject of legal professional privilege and that other documents attract legal professional privilege. The Court has power to make declarations to this effect. I propose to give AWB and the Commonwealth an opportunity to make submissions as to the form of any declarations that should be made to give effect to these reasons for judgment. AWB's second further amended application also sought declarations relating to the construction and validity of the Amending Act. In addition, AWB sought a declaration that the exercise of powers by the Commissioner under s 6AA(2) of the RCA, while these proceedings are pending before this Court, would constitute a contempt of Court, and injunctions restraining the Commissioner from making a decision under s 6AA(2) of the RCA. No live issues arise concerning these claims for relief: see AWB Ltd v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 2) [2006] FCA 913. Neither AWB nor the Commonwealth put any submissions to me, whether orally or in writing, concerning these claims for relief. It is unnecessary to address them further. Accordingly, the only orders I propose to make at this stage are as follows: (1) Within 3 business days AWB and the Commonwealth file an agreed minute of orders that give effect to these reasons for judgment. If AWB and the Commonwealth are unable to agree upon appropriate orders, within 3 business days AWB and the Commonwealth shall each file and serve a minute of the orders that it contends are necessary and appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment. (2) The proceeding be adjourned to Monday 25 September 2006 at 10.15am for any argument as to the orders. I certify that the preceding two hundred and fifty-one (251) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.

cited,Waters v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349,"As observed by Brennan J in Waters v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349 at 378 in considering the concept of reasonableness in a similar legislative provision: 'It is not possible to determine reasonableness in the abstract; it must be determined by reference to the activity or transaction in which the putative discriminator is engaged. Provided the purpose of the activity or transaction is not to discriminate on impermissible grounds, the reasonableness of a requirement or condition depends on whether it is reasonable to impose the requirement or condition in order to perform the activity or complete the transaction. There are two aspects to this criterion of reasonableness: first, whether the imposition of the condition is appropriate and adapted to the performance of the activity or the completion of the transaction; second, whether the activity could be performed or the transaction completed without imposing a requirement or condition that is discriminatory...or that is as discriminatory as the requirement or condition imposed. These are questions of fact and degree. Effectiveness, efficiency and convenience in performing the activity or completing the transaction and the cost of not imposing the discriminatory requirement or condition or of substituting another requirement or condition are relevant factors in considering what is reasonable.' 57 In the absence of submissions by the applicant, it is difficult to understand how the Barplus procedures, which required account of documents and monies received by flight attendants during the performance of their duties, were other than a reasonable requirement in the circumstances. 58 Accordingly in my view there is no merit in the applicant's submissions that he has been the subject of unlawful discrimination within the meaning of the DD Act ."
referred to,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50,"These proceedings were commenced on 20 December 2005 as an application for a declaration that the applicant, who had been removed from Australia, was entitled to an absorbed person visa pursuant to s 34 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act). The applicant also sought an order that the respondents arrange the return of the applicant to Australia, a declaration of wrongful imprisonment and damages. Since then, a number of events have occurred which have altered the issues that need to be determined. First, the applicant has been returned to Australia by the Commonwealth. Secondly, the High Court has given judgment allowing an appeal against a judgment of a Full Court of this Court. The Full Court's judgment underpinned part of the case originally advanced by the applicant. The parties agreed that judgment in this matter could be reserved until the High Court gave its judgment. The High Court gave judgment, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 , on 8 November 2006. The judgment of the High Court had the effect of removing two of the grounds relied on by the applicant. The High Court's judgment is discussed shortly. 2 The facts agreed upon by the parties were as follows. The applicant was born in Paris, France on 4 December 1966 to parents who were then both citizens of Yugoslavia. In 1968, when the applicant was two years of age, his parents migrated to Australia with him and his siblings. The applicant and his family members were granted permanent entry permits on their arrival into Australia. In 1983, the applicant's parents became Australian citizens. The applicant was not included in his parents' application for citizenship. From 19 September 1984 to 4 November 1984, the applicant travelled with his father to that part of Yugoslavia which, up until very recently, was known as Serbia and Montenegro, and then returned to Australia as the holder of an old visa of a kind known as a ""Return Endorsement"". 3 On 1 September 1994, the applicant became the holder of a transitional (permanent) visa by operation of reg 9 the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 1994 (Cth). Between 1979 and 2001, the applicant was convicted of a number of criminal offences. On 15 October 2002, the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs made a decision pursuant to s 501(2) of the Act to cancel the applicant's transitional (permanent) visa. The applicant was removed from Australia on 18 June 2004. 4 Before the decision of the High Court in Nystrom the principal ground relied on by the applicant was that he held an absorbed person visa by operation of s 34 of the Act and that the failure of the Minister to take into account that he held that visa gave rise to jurisdictional error. One of the statutory criteria for that visa was that the applicant had not, on or after 2 April 1984, left Australia. The Minister contended this criterion had not been satisfied by the applicant having regard to his travel to Yugoslavia in late 1984. Submissions were directed to the meaning of ""left Australia"". 5 Another argument advanced by the applicant was that s 200, and not s 501, was the applicable source of the power on which the Minister might have acted and that there was a direct repugnance between s 501 and ss 200 and 201, with the result that the first respondent's decision was vitiated by jurisdictional error. 6 It is not necessary to consider those arguments in light of the High Court's decision which held that where a person held two visas (the same visas the applicant contends he held in this matter), each of which conferred the same substantive rights, in cancelling one the Minister was not bound to take into account the ""nature"" of the other because there was no consideration relevant to the applicant's absorbed person visa which was not relevant to and considered when the Minister cancelled his transitional (permanent) visa (at [129] per Heydon and Crennan JJ). Gummow and Hayne JJ held that nothing in the text of s 501 or s 501F provided any support for reading into s 501(2) a requirement to consider the possible effect of s 501F on the visa holder (at [41]). Even if the applicant held an absorbed person visa in addition to his transitional (permanent) visa, s 501F(3) operates to cancel the absorbed person visa. 7 The other issues which Nystrom resolved concerned whether there was repugnancy between ss 200 and 201, and s 501 of the Act. The issue was whether s 501 of the Act, as a general provision, yielded to the more specific provisions in s 200 and s 201 governing the deportation of non-citizens who have committed criminal offences with the result that the Minister had no power to cancel a visa under s 501 in circumstances governed by s 200 and s 201. 8 The High Court in Nystrom rejected this proposition and held that (at [61] per Gummow and Hayne JJ): ...the two powers do not deal with the same subject-matter so as to attract the operation of the maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum and the reasoning which underpins Anthony Hordern and other decisions. The scheme of the Principal Act does not treat as having the one identity deportation and cancellation of a visa. This is so notwithstanding that, by reason of other provisions of the Principal Act, the exercise of both powers may well result in the same practical outcome. and at [67], and [69]-[70]: The powers in s 501(2) and s 200 have different provenances, and persons in respect of whom a deportation order has been made have a different status and different rights under the Principal Act. Those differences cannot be ignored by an ellipsis which regards s 200 and s 501 as directed to the same practical outcome. ... Section 501(2) and ss 200 and 201 have different consequences for the status of individuals in the context of the Principal Act. Where a deportation order is made, the individual has the status of a lawful non-citizen who is subject to deportation. If an order under s 501(2) be made, the status of the individual changes to that of unlawful non-citizen. The Principal Act attaches significance to each status. Accordingly it is not open to characterise the powers as dealing with the same subject-matter in the sense of the Anthony Hordern line of cases. In the circumstances of this case, the inapplicability of s 200 (by reason of non-satisfaction of s 201(b)(i)) cannot deny the application of s 501(2) by reference to s 501(6)(a). 9 The remaining grounds in this matter concern the procedures adopted by the Minister in reaching the decision to cancel the applicant's transitional (permanent) visa. 10 The applicant submitted that Direction 21 required the decision-maker to consider certain international obligations found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Direction 21 was made under s 499 of the Act which provides that the Minister may give directions to a person or body about the performance of functions under the Act or as to the exercise of powers under the Act, but such a direction must not be inconsistent with the Act or the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth). A person or body receiving the direction must comply with the direction. Direction 21 concerns ""visa refusal and cancellation under section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 ""."
considered,NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413,"Proceedings before the Tribunal, it will be recalled, are but part of an administrative decision-making process and not adversarial litigation. An administrative determination by one Tribunal thus results in no conclusive determination binding on subsequent Tribunals called upon to make a subsequent decision, even in respect to the same claim. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 , 215 CLR 518 at 540 1 Gummow and Hayne JJ explained the position as follows: [71] In adversarial litigation, findings of fact that are made will reflect the joinder of issue between the parties. The issues of fact and law joined between the parties will be defined by interlocutory processes or by the course of the hearing. They are, therefore, issues which the parties have identified. A review by the Tribunal is a very different kind of process [Mahon v Air New Zealand Ltd [1984] AC 808 at 814; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 282]. It is not adversarial; there are no opposing parties; there are no issues joined. The person who has sought the review seeks a particular administrative decision -- in this case the grant of a protection visa -- and puts to the Tribunal whatever material or submission that person considers will assist that claim. The findings of fact that the Tribunal makes are those that it, rather than the claimant, let alone adversarial parties, considers to be necessary for it to make its decision. Those findings, therefore, cannot be treated as a determination of some question identified in any way that is distinct from the particular process of reasoning which the Tribunal adopts in reaching its decision. See also: NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 at [25] [28] per Siopsis J."

The Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court by Ms Yang has much in common with the Notice of Appeal as filed by Ms Mead in her own appeal. Again the same approach has been pursued of attempting to discern in any of the purported "" Grounds of Appeal "" whether there is any error in the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate or whether Ms Yang has any "" counter-claim, set-off or cross demand "" which has not hitherto been addressed. None can be discerned. Whatever may have been the difficulties confronting Ms Yang when before the Federal Magistrates Court, no such difficulties were claimed in this Court. Her appeal was presented on her behalf by Ms Mead."
followed,Graywinter Properties Pty Ltd v Gas &amp; Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund (1996) 70 FCR 452,"Section 459G(3)(a) states that an application to set aside a statutory demand can only be made if an ""affidavit supporting the application"" is filed within 21 days of service of the demand. Unless such an affidavit is filed and served in time, there is no application under s 459G and, consequently, s 459H will not apply. If there is no application, the Court has no jurisdiction and the situation cannot be remedied by filing further supporting material at a later stage; Graywinter Properties Pty Ltd v Gas &amp; Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund (1996) 70 FCR 452 at 455 and 459. If there is a valid application, further affidavits may be filed to supplement the case made in the initial supporting affidavit; Graywinter Properties at 460. The defendant submits that the affidavit filed on 21 December 2006 does not set out a genuine offsetting claim and is therefore not a supporting affidavit for the purposes of s 459G(3)(a). Consequently, it is submitted, the Court's jurisdiction to set aside the statutory claim is not enlivened. 16 The leading authority on the question of the minimum requirements for an affidavit to be a ""supporting affidavit"" as required by s 459G(3)(a) is generally accepted as being the decision of Sundberg J in Graywinter Properties. His Honour observed at 459: In order to be a ""supporting affidavit"", an affidavit must say something that promotes the company's case. An affidavit which merely says ""I am a director of the company but am too busy at present to make a full affidavit, and I will do so later"" would not support the application. It would in no way advance, further or assist the company's cause, which is to have the notice set aside. At the other extreme, the affidavit need not detail, in admissible form, all the evidence that supports the contention of a genuine dispute.... That evidence must be available at the hearing of the application to set aside, because that application is for final and not interlocutory relief... 17 In Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd v MacDougal [2004] NSWSC 560 at [7] , Barratt J, echoing comments he had previously made in Process Machinery Australia Pty Ltd (t/as DCL Engineering) v ACN 057 260 590 Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 45 at [21] - [22] , said of the "" Graywinter principle"": What it means is that the application ... and the affidavit in support of that application, both filed and served within the 21 day period stipulated in s 459G(3) , must fairly alert the claimant to the nature of the case the company will seek to make in seeking to have the statutory demand set aside. The content of the application and affidavit must convey, even if it be by necessary inference, a clear delineation of the area of controversy so that it is identifiable with one or more of the grounds made available by ss 459H and 459J for setting aside statutory demands. The process of delineation may not be extended after the end of the 21 day period although it is open to the plaintiff to supplement the initial affidavit by way of additional evidence relevant to the area of controversy identified within the period. 36 The plaintiff also relied on a supplementary affidavit of Dr Chisholm filed on 10 August 2007. Annexed to this affidavit are purchase orders, bills of lading and invoices relating to the dye supplied by the defendant in early 2005. The affidavit provides additional factual detail in support of the plaintiff's claim to have an offsetting debt. Given that the first affidavit had clearly indicated the general nature of its case it is entirely legitimate for the plaintiff to expand the factual grounds on which it relies in this way; SMEC International 38 ACSR at 599, Graywinter Properties 70 FCR at 460."
referred to,SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365,"French J, at first instance , in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365 at [74] said: The finding of fraud should have specified, in one place in the reasons what was said that was fraudulent, how it was fraudulent and how it was acted upon. This statement was approved by the High Court in that case on appeal: SZFDE at [41]. 56 The Authority, as part of its case on the issue of fraud, did not seek to prove what information it actually had received and relied upon in making its several decisions to approve and register under ss 19(1) ; 20(1). 57 Rather, senior counsel for the Authority referring to the statement of French J said: We know what was the fraud, we know how it was effected and how it was acted on. It was acted on by the making of the registration. The fact that it was operative ... flows from the legislation that it was operative ... 58 Accordingly, the case for the Authority is that the provision of the fictitious name and address of Evergreen being particulars prescribed under Regulations 15 and 16 necessarily leads, as a matter of inference, to the conclusion that each approval and registration was procured or induced by fraud. I do not agree. 59 Section 11(1)(a) and (b) together provide in effect that an application to the Authority under s 10 for approval of an active constituent or for registration of a chemical product must be made in writing in or to the effect of the approved form and contain, or be accompanied by, any information that the Authority requires. There is no evidence as to whether the various applications were made in or to the effect of the approved form. No reliance was placed upon the wording of the approved form. It was not referred to in submissions."
cited,House of Spring Gardens Ltd v Waite [1985] FSR 173,"Thus in Den Norske Bank ASA v Antonatos [1999] QB 271, Waller LJ (with whom Chadwick and Millett LJJ agreed) said in a passage at 290, upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance: 'It is finally important to recognise that it is only in exceptional circumstances that cross-examination will be ordered on an affidavit sworn pursuant to a Mareva order: see House of Spring Gardens Ltd v Waite [1985] FSR 173 at 181, per Slade LJ. The anxieties expressed by Scott J in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540 relating to the court wanting no part of a star chamber process must constantly be borne in mind...' The passage from the reasons for judgment of Slade LJ in House of Spring Gardens, referred to by Waller LJ above, reads as follows: 'I can very well see that on the particular facts of many cases perhaps most cases the court might not consider it ""just and convenient"" to order the cross-examination of a defendant who has filed an affidavit in purported compliance with a Mareva order, in a case where the plaintiff has not yet seen fit to issue a motion for contempt and is not seeking an order for the swearing of a second affidavit by the defendant concerned...' Whether there has occurred 'purported compliance with a Mareva order' must surely be viewed in terms of substance as well as mere form. Lord Justice Slade made those remarks in the course of overruling the decision of Scott J at first instance, which decision had been to the effect that a court did not have the power under s 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK) to make an order requiring cross-examination ancillary to compliance with a Mareva order, in the absence of circumstances whereby a justiciable issue is before the Court in respect of which the evidence of the deponent is relevant to the resolution thereof, for instance where the deponent of the disclosure affidavit was the subject of a contempt motion. The 'anxieties expressed by Scott J', and also referred to by Waller LJ in Den Norske Bank , appear in Scott J's earlier reasons for judgment in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540. In that latter case, Scott J was concerned with an application seeking orders that the defendant submit to cross-examination on a wide range of matters in aid of earlier Anton Piller and Mareva orders made by the Court. Scott J referred to the scope of the cross-examination contemplated at 543 as follows: 'Mr Prescott [for the plaintiff] made clear that the purpose of his proposed cross-examination of the first defendant is a free-ranging one. He proposes to question him as to the whereabouts of his assets world-wide. He proposes to question him as to his knowledge of and part played in transactions in counterfeit Baygon wherever they may have happened.'"
followed,Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; (2005) 223 ALR 27,"Registrar accepted that while use of the Pioneer KK marks had been demonstrated on computer peripherals, no use had been shown on the remaining removal goods and the removal services within the relevant period and Pioneer KK could not establish circumstances that were an obstacle to the full use of the registrations. On the basis that it is not necessary for exceptional circumstances to exist before the Registrar may apply the power found in s 101(3) in favour of an opponent ( Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; (2005) 223 ALR 27 at [98] per Lander J), the Registrar concluded that, despite non-use being established for a range of the removal goods and for the removal services, it was not viable to limit the registrations by removing the removal goods and the removal services from the Register. The basis for this was that the difference between computer goods on the one hand and audio, audio-visual and home entertainment products on the other does not enable the drawing of ""fine lines"" between those goods for which use was demonstrated and those the subject of non-use. The Registrar considered the evidence as to the likelihood of deception or confusion among consumers. She concluded that Pioneer KK had a significant reputation in the Pioneer KK marks and in the word ""Pioneer"". The Registrar took into account the time before the relevant period, when Pioneer KK produced and sold entire computer systems under the brand ""Pioneer"" and under the first Pioneer KK mark, although such sales were limited, as well as evidence as to its future plans for research and development of products that combine home entertainment and computing in one package. The Registrar concluded at [37] that it was not appropriate to make a distinction between the computers and associated products of Pioneer Computers and the audio, visual and electronic products of Pioneer KK. She concluded that there was a ' high likelihood of deception or confusion in the marketplace '. While recognising that Pioneer Computers had seemingly used PIONEER honestly for over 10 years, had goodwill in the computer marketplace and intended to continue to use the trade mark PIONEER in connection with goods and services unless prevented from doing so, the Registrar concluded that the public interest was best served by declining to amend the registrations. Rather, she concluded that the public interest was best served by retaining the registrations in total and preserving the established trade marks. In Kowa Company at [98], Lander J rejected the submission that a party seeking the exercise of the discretion needs to show ""exceptional circumstances"". In E &amp; J Gallo at [198], Flick J agreed with Lander J that there is no requirement to establish exceptional circumstances. With respect, I also agree with Lander J that there is no warrant to read a requirement for exceptional circumstances into s 101(3)."
considered,Enterprise Oil Limited v Strand Insurance Company Ltd [2006] EWHC 58 (Comm),"In any event, the principle formulated in Lumbermens has been the subject of controversy. A little over a year after judgment in Lumbermens , Aikens J in Enterprise Oil Limited v Strand Insurance Company Ltd [2006] EWHC 58 (Comm) said at [166- 171]: Therefore, contrary to the view expressed by Colman J at paragraph 47 of his judgment in Lumbermen's , in my view those cases do not establish that it is a pre-condition for recovery under a liability policy that the insured has 'ascertained', by virtue of the wording of a judgment, or award or settlement agreement itself, the 'specific cost to the insured of discharging its insured liability'. In other words, in my view an insured does not have to show an amount of its loss to be claimed under an insured peril covered by the liability policy has been 'specifically ascertained' in the wording of a judgment, award or settlement. I say this for two particular reasons, quite apart from the fact that neither case uses such language. [original emphasis] The most important, if obvious, point is that an insurer always has the right to challenge whether the insured's right to indemnity under the policy has been established. Therefore it has the right to challenge whether the insured was, in fact and law, liable to the third party. It has the right to challenge the quantum of the liability. And it must also have the right to challenge whether, on the facts of the case, the insured's liability to the third party is a loss within the scope of the liability policy, whatever is stated in a judgment, award or settlement. Apart from anything else, the insurer will not be a party to the judgment, award or settlement, unless specifically involved. I accept that in the case of judgments and awards, the conclusion of a competent tribunal on the merits as to liability and quantum is unlikely to be upset in an action on the liability policy. But I cannot see why, in principle, it should not be challenged. In the case of settlements, Colman J himself specifically accepted that an insurer is not bound by a settlement agreement between the insured and the third party as to liability, or quantum. However, Colman J draws a distinction between two functions of 'ascertainment' by judgment, award or settlement. He describes one function as a 'source of evidence' as to liability and quantum of the insured to the third party. He says that cases affirming an insurer's right to challenge issues of liability and quantum in a settlement agreement are concerned only with that function of 'ascertainment'. But he states that the primary function of 'ascertainment' is to identify and 'thereby represent the assured's loss attributable to the relevant liability'. I cannot find that function identified in any of the cases to which Colman J refers. Moreover, it seems to me wrong in principle for the reason that I have already given, ie. that a judgment, award or settlement between an insured and a third party is not concerned to 'ascertain' the loss of the insured under a liability policy; it is irrelevant to those parties. I accept that if the insured has negotiated a settlement which identifies certain heads of claim as being referable to certain causes of action that are within the perils insured under the insured's liability policy, then that will be evidence that the insured has suffered a loss that is covered by the policy. But, as the case of MDIS Ltd v Swinbank shows, that can be challenged by underwriters. If it is challenged, then the question of whether there has been a loss covered by the policy terms will be decided on evidence that is extrinsic to the settlement agreement itself. If that exercise is permissible, which it must be, then I cannot see the basis for saying that an insured has no cause of action against a liability insurer unless it can demonstrate that there was a pre-existing determination, in the settlement agreement itself, of the precise amount of its liability to a third party that is attributable to a peril insured under the liability policy. Therefore, on principle, I think that it is open to an insured to assert and prove, by extrinsic evidence, that it is liable to a third party for a particular sum under a settlement that has been made and that the particular sum represents a loss covered by an insured peril under the liability policy. Equally, if an insured had made a settlement which purported to identify a particular sum as representing the quantum of liability for a particular type of loss that equated to an insured peril under the liability policy, the insurer would be free to challenge the insured's liability to the third party, the quantum of the liability and whether the particular liability identified in the settlement did, in fact, constitute a loss covered by an insured peril under the policy. These comments are obiter. Nevertheless they were adopted by Morrison J, also in obiter, in AIG Europe (Ireland) Limited v Faraday Capital Limited [2006] EWCH 2707 (Comm) at [69]."
referred to,Perpetual Plantations of Australia Ltd v United Tree Farmers Ltd (1993) 10 ACSR 82,"Finally, I would not grant G &amp; J Gears leave to amend the motion to seek injunctive relief restraining the winding up proceeding. Counsel for G &amp; J Gears referred to decisions concerning applications for injunctive relief in winding up proceedings, as for example, Perpetual Plantations of Australia Ltd v United Tree Farmers Ltd (1993) 10 ACSR 82 ("" Perpetual Plantations "") and Shanefield Pty Ltd v McLaren [1999] QSC 366. As these authorities recognize, a court, on a winding up application, may refuse a winding up order where the alleged ground for winding up is deemed insolvency and the court is satisfied that the debt is genuinely disputed as relevantly defined. Any such statement is subject to the Corporations Act , including s 459S. 65 Finally, Brobo's counsel submitted, and I accept, that if a litigant commences separate proceedings to restrain a winding up ( ex hypothesi , in the same court as the winding up proceeding) there will always be a question as to whether the litigant should have presented its defence to the winding up in the winding up proceeding itself: see Perpetual Plantations at 85-6 per Burley J; also David Grant at 279; and Marlan Financial Services Pty Ltd v New England Agricultural Traders Pty Ltd [1999] VSC 435 per Byrne J. According to Brobo, there were numerous matters that indicated that G &amp; J Gears should present its defence case in the winding up, including that the Davis affidavit was in non-specific terms and did not show that the purpose of the statutory demand was other than to achieve a winding up (see the discussion at [60] above). I accept Brobo's submission. It would appear likely that G &amp; J Gears will have an opportunity, at the hearing of the winding up petition, to rely on the matters in opposition to the winding up that it could not put forward on its application to set aside the statutory demand. These matters would not appear to fall within the prohibition in s 459S of the Corporations Act ."

In Bhardwaj , supra , Callinan J concluded: [163] ... If one thing is abundantly clear, it is that the Tribunal must, if an application has properly been made as it was here, review the Minister's decision. This means that the Tribunal must exercise the jurisdiction of reviewing the Minister's decision: that is to say, it must make a decision on the application and any documents properly submitted by an applicant, with, as part of, or relevant to it. To fail, or refuse to receive and consider such a document, and to make a decision without regard to it, is a failure to exercise jurisdiction. This is more than a failure to give a party a hearing. It is to proceed on a false basis that such a document simply does not exist or has not been communicated to the Tribunal. The Tribunal would in these circumstances no more be exercising its jurisdiction than a court would be in deciding a case in favour of a defendant without looking at the plaintiff's initiating document and pleading, or even knowing that they had been filed in the registry of the court.

The requirement to review the decision under s 414 of the Act requires the Tribunal to consider the claims of the applicant. To make a decision without having considered all the claims is to fail to complete the exercise of jurisdiction embarked on. The claim or claims and its or their component integers are considerations made mandatorily relevant by the Act for consideration ... It is to be distinguished from errant fact finding. The nature and extent of the task of the Tribunal revealed by the terms of the Act ... make it clear that the Tribunal's statutorily required task is to examine and deal with the claims for asylum made by the applicant. ...

applied,Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515,"Earlier on 25 August 2004, a complaint had been lodged with HREOC by the present applicant Mr Jeremy Jones, in his capacity as President of the said Executive Council of Australian Jewry. Contained within that letter of complaint was the following: 'We write to lodge a formal complaint under the anti-racial-hatred provisions (Part IIA) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) in respect of material published on the Australian website http://www.biblebelievers.org.au (""The website""). The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak representative organisation of the Australian Jewish community, complains that: (i) the material on the website is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate and intimidate Jewish Australians; and (ii) one of the reasons that the material has been published is the race or national or ethnic origin of Jewish people, including Jewish Australians. The specific matters complained of are as follows: 1. At http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/nl242.htm under the heading Lies and the First Anniversary of the 9/11 Conspiracy where the following words appear: We have all seen how the holocaust hoax of six-million Jews claimed to have been gassed and cremated by Germany in World War I failed to deceive the mob in 1919. Whereas monopolistic control of the media, film, and a more boldly pursued holocaust hoax of six-million Jews claimed gassed and cremated by Germany in World War II has produced such powerful psychological and material results the entire world is enslaved to the beneficiaries of the lie and Temples of Equivocation affront the intelligence of humanity in major cities world-wide. 2. At http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/wasthere.htm the following words appear: The Holocaust has become the greatest instrument of sympathy which any nation has ever been able to use to gain support for wars, expansion and foreign-aid: This has made Israel the world's sixth strongest military power. The gravest threat to all this wealth and influence is the growing doubt over the question of whether or not a real holocaust of 6 million Jews actually took place. 3. At the "" wasthere.htm "" webpage the following words appear at the conclusion: The main theme of Jewish fund-raising is the holocaust and has been for 38 years. When they don't use the holocaust the money collection sharply drops off. Thus the more the Press, TV and Hollywood promotes the holocaust the more money the United Jewish Appeal and other Zionist funds can extract from gullible people... Jewish leaders have discovered that by repeating holocaust stories over and over again they can instil a guilt complex within all Gentiles. This effectively silences most critics of Zionist political goals... Why doesn't the Jew-controlled press, TV and film industry give massive media attention to real victims and to proven holocausts of Gentiles in recent history. ... In our submission, the above material breaches the provisions of Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act because it conveys the following imputations: (a) there is serious doubt that the Holocaust occurred; (b) it is unlikely that there were homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz; (c) Jewish people who are offended by and challenge Holocaust denial are of limited intelligence; and (d) some Jewish people, for improper purposes, including financial gain, exaggerated the number of Jews killed during World War II and the circumstances in which they were killed. ... In this respect, we refer you to the case of Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 in which the Full Court of the Federal Court upheld the decision of Branson J at first instance that it is unlawful under Part IIA of the Act to publish material that conveys inter alia the imputations particularised above. In our submission the material complained of conveys further imputations that are also in breach of Part IIA of the Act, namely that: (a) Jews as a group are inherently malevolent towards other people; (b) Jews as a group are engaged in a global conspiracy to dominate other people; and (c) the State of Israel, as the State of the Jewish people, is a product of that conspiracy. We further submit that none of the material complained of falls within the exemptions contained in s 18D of the Act. You will be aware that this Council has brought two cases of racial hatred before HREOC in the past, one against Olga Scully and the other against Fredrick Toben. Both cases were ultimately heard and determined in favour of the Council by the Federal Court of Australia. In both cases the Court was satisfied that Jews, and Jewish Australians in particular, constitute a race or a national or ethnic group for the purposes of the Act. In the Toben case, the Court also found that the publication of material on the internet is an act that is done otherwise than in private for the purposes of s 18C of the Act. We are seeking to have the material complained of removed from the internet and an apology to Australia's Jewish community being given publicly by the website's owner/s.' The reference in the above letter to 'Jewish Australians' and 'Australian Jewish Community ' may be observed. The connection of the BBC and of Mr Grigor-Scott to the foregoing Bible Believers' website will be further indicated in these reasons. The grounds or particulars of the complaint were at least implicitly adopted by Mr Jones therein and subsequently pursued in the present proceeding. 7 The foregoing decision on appeal in Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515 was made on 27 June 2003 by a Full Federal Court comprising Carr, Kiefel and Allsop JJ in favour of Mr Jones as complainant also in those proceedings, in line with the decision at first instance of Branson J in Jones v Toben (2002) 71 ALD 629. Mr Jones, being the applicant for relief there involved, is the same representative person for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry as here constituted. 8 The circumstances leading to the Court's decision-making in Toben [2003] FCAFC 137 ; 129 FCR 515 were similar in substance to those which have led to the bringing of the present proceedings, and reflected a not dissimilar theme to the subject matter of complaint involving denial of the Holocaust which preceded and continued throughout World War II, an attack upon the widespread exposure of those circumstances on the part of Jewish people, and assertions that Jewish people exaggerated the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust for improper purposes. The language the subject of complaint in Toben was described by Carr J at [45] as 'deliberately provocative and inflammatory' and a 'flamboyantly-worded challenge' , and lacking in good faith, those being descriptions adopted by the applicant in relation to its case against the respondents. 9 I observe moreover that in the concurring appellate judgment of Kiefel J in Toben [2003] FCAFC 137 ; 129 FCR 515 , her Honour concluded, at [77], that: ' [t] he likelihood that the appellant wrote only to pursue the truth of those subjects is rendered implausible by this unnecessary aside, which appears to have no real purpose in such a debate other than to disparage Jewish people. In my view, it confirms what a reading of the article as a whole raises as a prospect, namely that it was published with Jewish people in mind, as those responsible for concocting the Holocaust and, indeed, as an attack upon them'. A similar approach has been adopted by Mr Jones in his presentation of the present case. Her Honour agreed with Carr J that there was no proof of the appellant's (ie Toben's) good faith. 10 In the further concurring judgment of Allsop J, his Honour made the following observation at [98]: '98. The above history (taken from the works of scholars, Lerner and Schwelb, working contemporaneously with events) is given to illuminate what it was that the international community was dealing with. By this time in the twentieth century, the nations of the world had experienced a century stained by, amongst other catastrophes, racial slaughter, pogroms, forced removal and relocations of whole peoples, religious and ethnic genocide, and were undergoing the trauma involved in the break-up and disintegration of colonial empires and national and regional political structures based on racial characteristics. The unexpected recrudescence, in the winter of 1959-1960, of some of the most recent and horrific manifestations of racist behaviour enlivened the world community to act swiftly and (with an inevitable degree of variation in political perspective) unanimously, to take steps towards the elimination [his Honour's emphasis] of the perceived evil. The perceived evil was all [again his Honour's emphasis] forms of racial discrimination and racial prejudice, the manifestation of which had been, in recent generations, at times horrifically violent and strident, at times overt, and at times less overt and less brutal, but nevertheless insidiously pervasive. In any form, it was recognised, by all nations in the international community, to strike at the dignity and equality of all human beings.' Thereafter at [100]-[101], his Honour added: '100. Racial hatred was one form or manifestation of the perceived evil. Unhappily, it was a form with which the nations in the General Assembly in 1960 to 1965 were all too familiar. It was the form of the perceived evil most likely to lead to brutality and violence, but it was not the only form of the perceived evil antithetical to the dignity and equality inherent in all human beings upon which the Charter of the United Nations was based. It was to all [his Honour's emphasis] such forms and manifestations that the Convention was directed. 101 The definition of ""racial discrimination"" in Art 1 of the Convention confirmed the wide aim of the Convention: Article 1 1. In this Convention, the term ""racial discrimination"" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.' His Honour then referred at some length to the public discussion and debate, and to issues as to in-roads into freedom of speech, which led to the enactment of the RD Act in Australia. 11 The material relied on, in particular, by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry was The Bible Believers' Newsletter #242 , (the copy before the Court bearing the date 9 May 2005). It is 15 pages in length and contains the following segments ( inter alia ): '(i) an introduction commencing 'We focus on the PRESENT Truth what Jesus is doing NOW...' 'Seven Pillars of Jewish Denial' 'Landmark Court Ruling Against Holocaust Denier' 'September 11 US Government Accused' 'Thinking Up a Pretext for War' 'Lies and the First Anniversary of the 9/11 Conspiracy' (ii) the following concluding material: 'Pass it on... Send this article to someone you know Brother Anthony Grigor-Scott is a non-denominational minister. He has ministered full-time since 1981, primarily to other ministers and their congregations in other countries. He pastors Bible Believers' tiny congregation, and is available to teach in your Church.' Below that appeared reference to the details of the BBC website. 12 The website also contained the following material: (i) an article by Dr E R Fields headed ' Was there Really a Holocaust '? (ii) an abridgment of a book titled ' The International Jew , The World's Foremost Problem ' (the author whereof was stated to be Henry Ford Senior) containing the ' Editor's Forward ' of one page in length, together with a summary of the life of Henry Ford contained in a journal apparently published, and which referred to the circumstances that Mr Ford ' was accused by many Jews' and 'was a resolute opponent of Roosevelt's policy of ""controls"" in industry and commerce ...'. 13 Following upon that material being placed before HREOC, Mr Grigor-Scott purportedly on behalf of the BBC or in any event in the name of the BBC, wrote further to HREOC the following communications in support of his request that it terminate what he described as 'Mr Jones unwarranted complaint' (now forming Exhibit A1 in the present proceedings): (i) letter dated 5 November 2004; (ii) letter dated 18 November 2004 (which comprised in all some 11 pages); (iii) email dated 19 November 2004; (iv) letter dated 18 January 2005."

applied,Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165,"eBay contends that a contract in writing was made on the terms displayed on the Online Fulfilment website. eBay argues the contract was, in effect, signed electronically by the purchaser through his or her clicking on the relevant buttons agreeing to the terms and conditions, making payment and receiving the webpage and email confirmations of the order. On this analysis the contract was signed and completed after the payment and nominated purchaser details were accepted. The terms of the signed contract were those set out in the webpages detailing the terms and conditions in accordance with Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165. 25 eBay argues that, objectively, a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have concluded that terms and conditions upon which the ticket was sold to the purchaser were those repeated five times throughout the process on the different webpages. These incorporated old condition 6. The ticket that was delivered in consequence of a transaction occurring online before 8 November 2006, however, contained new condition 6 which eBay says can have no contractual force or effect because it had been added without agreement after the contract was made. Thus, eBay says, in addition to the other inaccuracies it claims, the ticket in such cases is misleading because of its different terms and it conveys a false representation that new condition 6 is a part of the contract. 26 Creative contends that new condition 6 is merely a statement in different language to the same force and effect of old condition 6 and has no difference in substance. 49 The Ticketmaster online purchase was a contract in writing signed by the parties. By clicking on the relevant buttons and, by the computer bringing up all terms needed to purchase a ticket, on behalf of Ticketmaster as agent for Creative, the whole transaction was in writing, signed and agreed by the parties. A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have regarded the transaction completed on Ticketmasters' webpage as the contract: Toll (FCGT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165."
considered,Rail Access Corporation v New South Wales Minerals Council Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 517,"The Full Court confirmed the distinction between 'above rail' (transportation) and 'below rail' (infrastructure) services in its decision in Rail Access Corporation v New South Wales Minerals Council Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 517 (' Rail Access Case '). The Rail Access Case concerned the question of whether the NSW Rail Access Corporation provided a 'government coal-carrying service' within the meaning of Part IIIA of the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 (Cth) which could therefore not be a 'service' within the meaning of Part IIIA of the Act. Rail Access Corporation did not carry coal itself or offer the service of carrying coal, but it owned the railway line which Freight Rail Corporation used to carry coal and provided a below rail service to third parties seeking to run trains to transport coal on its tracks and related infrastructure. 85 In considering the definition of 'service' in s 44B, the Full Court held, at 524: The definition of ""service"" in s 44B of the Act makes clear that a service is something separate and distinct from a facility. It may, however, consist merely of the use of a facility. The definition of ""service"" distinguishes between the use of an infrastructure facility, such as a road or railway line, and the handling or transporting of things, such as goods or people, by the use of a road or railway line. The fact that one service provider, such as Freight Rail Corporation, is using the railway line infrastructure facility made available to it by Rail Access Corporation for the purposes of carrying coal by rail does not mean Rail Access Corporation is carrying on, or is the provider of, a service of carrying coal by rail. There is a clear distinction, enshrined in the Transport Administration Act and confirmed by the NSW Rail Access Regime, between the service provided by Rail Access Corporation and the service provided by Freight Rail Corporation. Freight Rail Corporation provides the service of transporting coal. Rail Access Corporation provides to Freight Rail Corporation the different service of making available the infrastructure facility which is necessary to enable Freight Rail Corporation to provide the transportation service. The respondent is seeking access to the service provided by Rail Access Corporation, not the service provided by Freight Rail Corporation. 86 The Full Court concluded that the provider of a rail network or permanent way provides a different service to an entity that provides the service of carrying or transporting the coal using the rail network."
cited,Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal [1990] HCA 31 ; (1990) 170 CLR 70,"The second aspect of procedural fairness or natural justice is that a person should not be a judge in his or her own cause. Here, each committee has acted as a protagonist in this Court in their own cause and they now suggest they should be returned to the position of being a judge, in the sense of a lay tribunal charged with functions of administrative decision-making, in the same cause. That is an unsatisfactory outcome which should not occur unless it is necessary under the legislation: see Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal [1990] HCA 31 ; (1990) 170 CLR 70 at 81-82 per Mason CJ and Brennan J, 96 per Deane J. I am of the preliminary opinion that it is not necessary, but I will hear the parties, if they desire, on whether I should make orders of the following nature: (a) An order in the nature of a writ of prohibition in the first instance issue prohibiting each of the first respondents from further constituting Professional Services Review Committee No 295 [293].

affirmed,SZMDG v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1075,"This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, delivered on 1 August 2008 and published as SZMDG v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1075. The learned federal magistrate dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal""), signed on 27 February 2008 and handed down or sent on 18 March 2008. The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to this appeal, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (""the Minister""), to refuse to grant to the appellant a protection visa. 2 By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (""the Migration Act ""), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms ""Refugees Convention"" and ""Refugees Protocol"" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to call these two instruments, taken together, the ""Convention"". For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who: owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country 3 The appellant is a citizen of Indonesia, who arrived in Australia on 14 August 2007. On 27 September 2007, he applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a protection visa. The decision of the Minister's delegate refusing to grant the visa was made on 15 November 2007. The appellant then applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision."
cited,In Re K.L. Tractors Ltd [1961] HCA 8 ; (1961) 106 CLR 318,"rule continued to apply to other incorporated associations. At least in respect of partially executed contracts, the absence of power may not have precluded their enforcement: In Re K.L. Tractors Ltd [1961] HCA 8 ; (1961) 106 CLR 318. That is not this case. There may also be circumstances where, notwithstanding that the corporation has acted ultra vires, relief may be available: see Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (Butterworths Looseleaf Service) at [12,060]. However, the rule was in any event ameliorated by provisions similar to that in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) in most, if not all, of the States' Associations Incorporation Acts: see s 17 Associations Incorporation Act 1981 (Vic); s 26 Associations Incorporation Act 1981 (Qld); s 27 Associations Incorporation Act 1985 (SA). There was no such provision in the Associations Incorporation Ordinance 1963 (NT) or in the Associations Incorporation Act 1978 (NT). Those enactments were repealed and replaced by the Associations Act (NT), enacted in 2003. There is also no such provision in the Associations Act (NT). Part 6 of the Associations Act (NT) deals with the transfer of property of an incorporated non-trading association. Each of the Housing Associations is not permitted to trade: Item 1.5 of the Schedule to their Constitutions. Section 54 Associations Act (NT) permits the transfer of real property by one association only to another body formed for promoting objects similar to its own or charitable objects, or to a council for the area in which the property is situated. That section also imposes procedural requirements. It is not necessary to refer to them. It is not suggested the grant of the proposed subleases is authorised by s 54 independently of the Constitutions of the Housing Associations. Nor, on the other hand, is it suggested that the grant of the proposed subleases is unlawful so as to prevent the Housing Associations from agreeing to enter into them. Section 54 is expressly subject to s 110. Section 110(2) restricts a Housing Association from disposing of, or charging, prescribed property, which appears to include a lease under the SPL Act or the CL Act (see the definition of prescribed property in s 4), except with the consent of the Minister administering that Act (and, by the NTNER Act, that would include the Minister) without the Minister's consent. It is also not necessary to further discuss those provisions as they were not relied upon, or referred to, either by the Residents or by any of the respondents, as informing the proper construction of the Constitutions of the Housing Associations either to grant or not to grant the proposed subleases. There is no doubt good reason for that. The CATSI Act does have a provision similar to that in s 125 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Section 96.1 relevantly provides: (1) An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation has the legal capacity and powers of an individual within and outside Australia. (2) An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation also has all the powers of a body corporate, including the power to, if the corporation's constitution permits, distribute any of the corporation's property among the members, in kind or otherwise. (3) An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation's legal capacity to do something is not affected by the fact that the corporation's interests are not, or would not be, served by doing it."
cited,Wily (as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Fuller) v Fuller [2000] FCA 1512,"In my view, to the extent that this is a cause of action under ss 51AA and 52 (and in my view the relevance of s 51AA is dubious) it is not one in respect of which the applicant has suffered personal injury within the meaning of s 116(2)(g) Bankruptcy Act . This is because, notwithstanding the claim that the applicant has suffered personal injury: a. Other than a statement that the applicant suffered personal injury, no injury is particularised or connection drawn between how a failure to warn and advise the applicant caused the applicant to suffer personal injury. A bare allegation that the applicant has suffered personal injury or wrong, without particularising the injury or wrong, or without stating the connection between the conduct complained of and the claimed personal injury or wrong, is not adequate to provide the applicant with standing to pursue litigation in the very limited circumstances of his bankruptcy. Particularising the damage and establishing the nexus would be necessary in any event. As explained in well-known comments of Bowen LJ in Ratcliffe v Evans (1892) 2 QB 524 at 532: 'The necessity of alleging and proving actual temporal loss with certainty and precision in all cases of the sort has been insisted upon for centuries... In all actions accordingly on the case where the damage actually done is the gist of the action, the character of the acts themselves which produce the damage, and the circumstances under which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved. As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on, both in pleading and proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and to the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done. To insist upon less would be to relax old and intelligible principles. To insist upon more would be the vainest pedantry.'

If the claim is to be categorised as a claim in negligence which has resulted in financial loss, it properly lies with the trustee in bankruptcy: Faulkner v Bluett . d. If the claim is to be categorised as a breach of fiduciary duty or trust it properly lies with the trustee in bankruptcy. As pointed out by RD Nicholson J in Pridmore v Magenta Nominees Pty Ltd (1999) 161 ALR 458 at 468: 'In relation to s 58(1)(a) 'the property of the bankrupt' as defined in par 116(1)(a) would include any choses in action which the applicants had to enforce equitable rights. Such rights, being property being divisible among the creditors of the bankrupt, would vest in the official trustee. If the equitable rights arose after the sequestration order it would for the same reasons be 'property that is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt' within s 58(6) and thus property to which s 58(1)(b) applies so that again the exercise of the rights would vest in the official trustee...' (note also Wily (as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Fuller) v Fuller [2000] FCA 1512 ; Pascoe, in the matter of Hudson [2006] FCA 785) e. If the claim is categorised as a breach of ss 51AA or 52 , it is claim with respect to a commercial transaction which has now vested in the trustee in bankruptcy."
discussed,Blatch v Archer [1774] EngR 2 ; (1774) 1 Cowp 63,"submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn against the applicants for failing to call their solicitors: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 ; Blatch v Archer [1774] EngR 2 ; (1774) 1 Cowp 63.

It that it was within the applicants' power to call their solicitors and their evidence should be assessed as Lord Mansfield CJ described in Blatch 1 Cowp at 65: ""[i]t is certainly a maxim that all evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was within the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other to have contradicted."""

cited,The University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1656,"The decision refusing the University's application was given on 1 December 2006: The University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1656. I noted in the reasons that Dr Gray did not contend that the material sought was irrelevant. He argued rather that it was of ""tangential"" relevance. It was not in issue that he treated patients during the relevant period but no issue about that treatment was raised on the pleadings. He maintained through his solicitors that it would be oppressive to require that he sort out and produce from the large number of documents in existence those which fell within the class the subject of the proposed order. I found the case advanced by the University for access to those records to be less than convincing. The class sought by its minute overreached in seeking a range of clinical data relevant to patients treated with an invention the subject of the proceedings. It was not limited to data flowing from such treatment. The description of records by reference to records of treatment with an ""invention"" would require judgments about what was meant by ""invention"". I also expressed reluctance about having the clinical data of individuals put in play in the proceedings without good reason. 7 The University has now adverted to discovery item 1804 which it had not previously raised in Court and seeks inspection of those documents. They may fall within, although they are not necessarily congruent with, the class of documents for which the University in effect sought additional discovery in October 2006. The question therefore is whether, clinical records having been discovered, the University is entitled to inspect them. 8 Order 15 relevantly provides: '1 After a directions hearing under Order 10, any party may, with the leave of the Court and within any period fixed by the Court for this purpose, by notice for discovery, in accordance with Form 21, filed and served on any other party, require any other party to give discovery of documents. 2(1) A party required to give discovery must do so within the time specified in the notice of discovery (not being less than 14 days after service of the notice of discovery on the party), or within such time as the Court or a Judge directs. 2(2) Unless the Court or a Judge orders otherwise, a party must give discovery by serving: (a) a list of documents required to be disclosed; and (b) an affidavit verifying the list. 3 Without limiting rule 3 or 7, the documents required to be disclosed are any of the following documents of which the party giving discovery is, after a reasonable search, aware at the time discovery is given: (a) documents on which the party relies; and (b) documents that adversely affect the party's own case; and (c) documents that adversely affect another party's case; and (d) documents that support another party's case. ... 6(1) A list of documents required by or under this Order shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be in accordance with Form 22 and conform to the requirements of this rule. ... 6(7) A list of documents shall appoint a time within 7 days after service of the list when, and a place where, the documents in the list may be inspected. ... 10(1) Where a pleading or affidavit filed by a party refers to a document, any other party may, by notice to produce served on him require him to produce the document for inspection. (2) Where a notice to produce a document is served on a party under subrule (1), he shall, within 4 days after that service, serve on the party requiring production a notice: (a) appointing a time within 7 days after service of the notice under this subrule when, and a place where, the document may be inspected; (b) claiming that the document is privileged from production and sufficiently stating the grounds of the privilege; or (c) stating that the document is not in his possession, custody or power and stating to the best of his knowledge information and belief where the document is and in whose possession, custody or power it is. 11(1) Where: (a) it appears from a list of documents filed by a party under this Order that any document is in his possession, custody or power; ... the Court may, subject to any question of privilege which may arise, order the party: (d) to produce the document for inspection by any other party at a time and place specified in the order; or (e) to file and serve on any other party a copy of the whole or any part of the document, with or without an affidavit verifying the copy made by a person who has examined the document and the copy. (2) An affidavit made pursuant to an order under paragraph (1)(e) shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, state whether there are in the document copied any and, if so, what erasures, interlineations or alterations. ... 15 The Court shall not make an order under this Order for the filing or service of any list of documents or affidavit or other document or for the production of any document unless satisfied that the order is necessary at the time when the order is made.'"

A declaration that Symbion Health is not bound by the provision for payment of the Symbion Health Break Fee and an injunction directed against payment of it directly affect Symbion Health's contractual obligations of Symbion Health to Healthscope and Healthscope's contractual rights against Symbion Health. 70 It is not practicable to formulate the relief sought in respect of the Symbion Health Break Fee so that it will affect only the rights and interests of the parties to the proceeding and not those of Healthscope.

The application of those statutory requirements was considered by Austin J in similar circumstances in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2000) 174 ALR 688. In that case the ACCC submitted that it had a public duty to improve competition and efficiency in markets and to foster a fair and competitive operating environment for businesses. One of the strategies used to achieve that objective is litigation in cases of serious breaches of the TP Act. The ACCC considered, in that case, that the conduct which it alleged was a serious example of price fixing and market sharing and that it had a duty in the public interest to reinstate and sue the perpetrator of some of that conduct. The former officers of the company then before the Court accepted that the ACCC had standing to apply as did his Honour. 10 In relation to standing, the present case is relevantly indistinguishable from that before Austin J. I find that the ACCC has the necessary interest in proceeding against the company in the discharge of its statutory functions such that it is ""a person aggrieved by the deregistration"" for the purposes of s 601AH(2). 11 In the case before Austin J the company whose reinstatement was sought had been placed in liquidation by a members' voluntary winding up. In the present case the company was voluntarily deregistered. A director of the company made a declaration of solvency on 7 December 2005 under s 601AA(2)."
cited,JMBV Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1474,"The respondents also contend that, having regard to the use of the present tense in s 138(3)(a), a condition precedent to a revocation order is a finding that the patentees were not entitled to the patent at the time of the application for revocation (or perhaps at the time of the hearing). I am far from persuaded that this construction is correct and it seems to be contrary to the views of Cooper J in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1999) 47 IPR 525, 536 and Crennan J in JMBV Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1474 , [130]-[131]. But even if this construction were correct, the way in which I would read the section is that if a person were not entitled to the patent at the time of grant then, at least in most cases, that non-entitlement would be (as here) a continuing state of affairs. So there is really nothing in the point."
cited,Hilder v Dexter [1902] AC 474,"It might be suggested that the Explanatory Memorandum ([21] above) is inconsistent with this principle insofar as it disregards ""any sort of discount or incentive"". However, the Memorandum is not to be taken too literally. For example, a range of ""kerbside valuations"" would hardly be a determination of market value binding on a court. In any event, an Explanatory Memorandum, however helpful, is not an expression of the will of Parliament and cannot prevail when a statute uses an expression, such as market value, to which courts of the highest authority have given a clear meaning. While Explanatory Memoranda are explicitly included in the extrinsic materials to which a court may give consideration under s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), there may still be something to be said for the trenchant view expressed by Lord Halsbury LC in Hilder v Dexter [1902] AC 474 at 477: ... I believe the worst person to construe (a statute) is the person who is responsible for its drafting. He is very much disposed to confuse what he intended to do with the effect of the language which in fact has been employed. 48 Mr Ferrier has applied a 10 per cent ""minority discount"". To some extent that overlaps with a further discount for litigation risk which he fixes at 25 per cent. 49 Mr Ferrier's figures quoted in [18] above do not take into account this latter discount because his instructions were to assume as a fact that the applicants (strictly speaking, that should be a hypothetical purchaser) would be able to establish oppression and obtain a winding up order. Mr Lipson's corresponding discount is 92.5 per cent, ie he assumes the chance of success at 7.5 per cent. The estimate of the prospects of success in litigation is probably not something within the specialised knowledge of a Chartered Accountant: see Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 79."
cited,Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537,"in my opinion, Clough was obliged under cl 3.3.2 of the Construction Contract to extend the validity of the performance guarantees so that they would be valid for 12 months plus 60 days from the date of completion of Works as varied. On the basis of the two variations to which I have referred, Clough, within a reasonable time of the date of each variation, was required to extend the performance guarantees to 31 March 2008 and June 30 2008 respectively. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact. It depends upon the circumstances and its limit is determined by what is fair to both parties: Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537 at 567-568. I do not accept Clough's submissions that the date for Practical Completion was at large and therefore that cl 3.3.2 could not be complied with because the duration of the extension was not clear. Even if it were the case that cl 3.3.2 required Clough to extend the performance guarantees at any time prior to their lapsing, as Clough contends, it was clear as at: (a) 16 April 2007 that Clough was not then prepared to extend the performance guarantees. In a letter to ONGC it advised ONGC that it required the three performance guarantees then held by ONGC to be returned and stated that it was willing to provide a performance bond to the value of 10% of the remaining work, in the amount of US$2.17 million; and (b) 1 June 2007 that the CEO of Clough had no relevant authority from Clough's Board to extend these and in any event such authorisation was, wrongly in my view, stated by him to be subject to ONGC agreeing to ""reach a negotiated exit solution"".

cited,Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) (2005) 215 ALR 301,"Ordinary sentencing principles are relevant, including specific and general deterrence. Thus in Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) (2005) 215 ALR 301 at [39], Goldberg J concluded: The penalty imposed must be substantial enough that the party realises the seriousness of its conduct and is not inclined to repeat such conduct. Obviously the sum required to achieve this object will be larger where the Court is setting a penalty for a company with vast resources. However, as specific deterrence is only one element and general deterrence must also be achieved, consideration of the party's capacity to pay must be weighed against the need to impose a sum which members of the public will recognise as significant and proportionate to the seriousness of the contravention. What is known in the criminal law as the ""totality principle"" is also relevant. That is, the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is appropriate for the entire contravening conduct involved: see Jurlique at [52]; Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1995) ATPR 41-375 at 40,169; Knight at [73]; and Visy Industries at [304].

applied,Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344,"The Court observes that in considering whether to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal under O 52 r 15(2) of the Rules, the Court must be satisfied that there is an acceptable explanation for the delay, that there would be no undue prejudice to the respondent if the Court were to grant leave, and that there is merit in the substantial application: see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349. There appears to be no valid reason why such considerations should not also apply to an application seeking an order of the Court that dispenses with the 21 day time limit prescribed by O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules. 22 As to delay, the applicant claimed at the hearing before the Court that her ignorance of Court procedure resulted in her failure to comply with O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules. Because the applicant is unrepresented and the delay is not extensive, the Court is prepared to accept this explanation. 23 There is no evidence before the Court that the Minister would be prejudiced if the Court were to grant an order dispensing with compliance with O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules."
cited,Harley v McDonald [2002] NZLR 1,"The Privy Council in Harley v McDonald [2002] NZLR 1, on appeal from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, held that the High Court of New Zealand had power to make costs orders against barristers and solicitors. In that country, as in Western Australia, there is a fused profession in which persons are admitted to practice as both barristers and solicitors. All have the same rights of audience in the courts. Lord Hope, delivering the judgment of their Lordships, said (at 23): '... it is hard to find a sufficiently clear dividing line between the style of practice of barristers on the one hand and that of solicitors on the other to justify giving an immunity from costs orders to barristers which is not enjoyed by solicitors. Recognition that barristers are subject to the same jurisdiction in this respect as solicitors is not inconsistent with any statutory provision or any rule of practice. In both cases there is the same public interest that a serious dereliction of duty to the Court by one of its officers should be dealt with by the Court. Their Lordships agree with the Court of Appeal that it is desirable in the public interest that the High Court should have power in appropriate cases to award costs against a barrister personally.' The distinction between solicitor and barrister appears to have no relevance in terms of principle in the exercise of the Court's powers to award costs against practitioners personally under s 43 or under O 62 r 9. Their distinctive roles may give rise to different applications of the general principles informing the exercise of the Court's powers."

cited,Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5 ; (1951) 83 CLR 1,"That reasoning dealt with what the Commission had provided in pars 10(f) and (g). But it avoided the real possibility that an inactive service with a soft dial tone might not be an ULLS service at all. Serviceability is one thing, existence another. As Fullagar J observed in Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5 ; (1951) 83 CLR 1 at 258: ""A power to make laws with respect to lighthouses does not authorize the making of a law with respect to anything which is, in the opinion of the law-maker, a lighthouse. A power to make a proclamation carrying legal consequences with respect to a lighthouse is one thing: a power to make a similar proclamation with respect to anything which in the opinion of the Governor-General is a lighthouse is another thing."" 173 In the way it was expressed, the Commission's final determination did not adapt the provisions of Code 569, because it presupposed the fundamental matter that an ULLS transfer request had to determine, namely, the existence of an ULLS to transfer. This created a fundamental uncertainty both as to how the final determination should be construed and the methodology for Telstra to follow postulated in par 10. If the presupposition is wrong in respect of a request made by Optus, will Telstra be in breach of the final determination since it can never supply the service over the identified pathway used by the soft dial tone? Alternatively, will Telstra be entitled to reject the request in any event because the omission of essential information in the ULLS transfer request process in cl 11 of Code 569 and or cl 13 of Guideline 587 (namely the ULLS identifier) entitled it to do so? 174 Neither scenario makes the final determination certain. The presupposition takes the place of the processes in cl 11 of Code 569 without establishing that the process in par 10(a) can be applied to a particular line with a soft dial which is not, in fact, an ULLS. And, notwithstanding that par 10(a) treats every request where a soft dial tone is present as an ULLS transfer request, if Telstra can reject each such request because it does not give an ULLS identifier, the process stipulated in the final determination is pointless."
followed,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"Further, it seems to me doubtful that invalidity would necessarily follow if Caltex's construction of the demand were adopted. By analogy with the approach taken in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [93] , I would ask whether it was a purpose of s 60(1) that to wrongly describe ""an amount equal to the amount of the Excise duty which would have been payable ..."" as a debt, when it is quite clear what is being demanded and why, should result in invalidity. Caltex did not advance any argument as to why such an error should result in invalidity, whether on a Project Blue Sky approach or otherwise. 172 As I have found the residual oils not to be ""refined"" or ""semi-refined"" products, they are not subject to excise duty under item 11 of the Tariff Act. Accordingly the Commissioner's objection decision the subject of the tax appeal must be set aside, together with the demand made by the Commissioner pursuant to s 60(1) of the Excise Act . The Commissioner should pay Caltex's costs of the tax appeal. 173 The s 39B proceeding is in substance dealt with by the result of the tax appeal. But for the agreement referred to at [44] it would have been necessary to fashion orders dealing with the numerous declarations contained in the application.

applied,Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99,"Mr O'Neill's decision was not within the expression ""decision to which this Act applies"" in s 3(1) of the AD(JR) Act because it was not ""a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment ..."" because: it was not a final, ultimate or operative determination, and was therefore not a ""decision"" for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 ("" ABT v Bond "") at 338); and it was not required or authorised by any enactment, and legal rights or duties do not owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision, or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement ( Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 ("" Tang "") at [78] [80]). The Guidelines are not ""an enactment"" as defined in s 3(1) of the AD(JR) Act, because they are not an instrument made under an Act: the most that can be said is that they were issued by the Commissioner to ATO officers as part of his general administration of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (""the ITAA""), s 8 of which provides: ""The Commissioner shall have the general administration of this Act"". With respect to whether the decision was made under an ""instrument"", the applicants submit that Tang establishes that the Guidelines are an instrument for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act. The High Court's decision in that case departed from previous authority to the effect that documents issued under a general power of administration could not constitute an instrument under the AD(JR) Act (as an illustration of that previous course of authority they refer to Australian National University v Lewins (1996) 68 FCR 87 ("" ANU v Lewins"") ). All earlier decisions on the matter must now be understood in light of the High Court's consideration in Tang of the expression ""a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment"". That case concerned a decision of Griffith University, through its relevant committee, to exclude a postgraduate student, Ms Tang, from a program leading to the award of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The decision was based on a finding that Ms Tang had engaged in academic misconduct. The relevant admission/exclusion, academic misconduct and appeal processes were the subject of policies adopted by the University Council. The policy documents were similar to the Guidelines in the sense that although the making of them was within the power and mandate of the Council as the University's governing body under the Griffith University Act 1998 (Qld), that Act did not refer, expressly or by implication, to the laying down of the policies. Rather, to do so was in the general power of the University Council as the body having the general functions and powers of management given it by the Act. Ms Tang applied for review of the University's decision under the Judicial Review Act 1991 (Qld). The issue was whether that decision was ""a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment"" a formula borrowed from the AD(JR) Act. The University sought summary dismissal. It failed at first instance in the Supreme Court of Queensland and then before the Queensland Court of Appeal. The High Court, however, by a 4:1 majority, allowed the University's appeal. Two judgments were delivered by the Judges constituting the majority, one by Gleeson CJ and the other by Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ (""joint judgment""). In their joint judgment in Tang , Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ pointed (at [60]) to dangers in looking at the expression ""a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment"" otherwise than as a whole. Their Honours quoted the following passage from Aronson MI, Dyer BD, Groves M, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3 rd ed, Lawbook Co, 2004) pp 73-74 (footnotes omitted): The recent trend is to treat decisions which can find no other statutory source of authority than such a clause [giving power or even a duty to administer an Act and to do all things necessary in that regard] as not being made under an enactment for ADJR purposes, although there has been scant attempt to identify why that approach should be adopted as a matter of principle. (Original emphasis.) Their Honours noted (at [78]) that while a decision, in order to be susceptible to review under the AD(JR) Act must be either expressly or by implication authorised or required by an enactment, requirement or authority is not alone sufficient. The further stipulation that the decision must be ""of an administrative character"" meant that there must be an affecting of legal rights and obligations. Their Honours said (at [80]): Do legal rights or duties owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement [cf R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett at 154] ? To adapt what was said by Lehane J in Lewins [ ANU v Lewins at 103], does the decision in question derive from the enactment the capacity to affect legal rights and obligations? Are legal rights and obligations affected not under the general law but by virtue of the statute? [ General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation [1993] FCA 473 ; (1993) 45 FCR 164 at 169]. Mr O'Neill's decision does not derive from the ITAA a capacity to affect legal rights and obligations. Nor do legal rights (of the Commissioner) or duties (of the applicants) in relation to the production of Documents 226 to 238 ""owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision, or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement"": Tang at [80]. It is O 33 r 12 and the general law that give the Commissioner procedural rights and impose on the applicants procedural obligations. Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ did not see it as an obstacle to their view the fact that the terms of the policy and other circumstances may well have created an expectation in Ms Tang that any withdrawal from her PhD candidature would only follow upon the fair treatment of complaints against her. Their Honours said (at [92]) that such an expectation would not create in Ms Tang any substantive rights under the general law, which would render the decision she challenged a decision made under the University's Act. A similar observation is to be made in relation to the Guidelines. They are calculated to create an expectation that they will be adhered to by the Commissioner. However, that expectation does not convert a non-reviewable decision into a reviewable one. The following summary paragraph (at [96] of the joint judgment in Tang ) concludes their Honours' discussion of the issues and immediately precedes their discussion of the orders to be made: The decisions of which the respondent complains were authorised, albeit not required, by the University Act. The Committees involved depended for their existence and powers upon the delegation by the Council of the University under ss 6 and 11 of the University Act. But that does not mean that the decisions of which the respondent complains were ""made under"" the University Act in the sense required to make them reviewable under the Review Act. The decisions did not affect legal rights and obligations. They had no impact upon matters to which the University Act gave legal force and effect. The respondent enjoyed no relevant legal rights and the University had no obligations under the University Act with respect to the course of action the latter adopted towards the former. This passage applies, mutatis mutandis, to the Guidelines and to Mr O'Neill's decision under them. I turn now to consider other authorities to which I was referred. In Tang , Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ described (at [84]) as a ""sound ground"" of non-reviewability, Black CJ's reference to the Commissioner's voting decision as one that was not given statutory effect by s 8 of the ITAA. For the reasons given above, the application is incompetent in so far as it relies on the AD(JR) Act. Sections 39B(1) and (1A) of the Judiciary Act In this case the jurisdictional question under s 39B(1) is whether the proceeding is a matter in which certiorari or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. It is not suggested that the Commissioner and Mr O'Neill (an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation) are not such officers. The applicants seek an order quashing or setting aside Mr O'Neill's decision and an injunction restraining the respondents ""from seeking access to"" Documents 226 to 238. The Court therefore has jurisdiction under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act . The question that remains in relation to s 39B(1) is whether the applicants have no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding (ie gaining the order and injunction they seek). In the present state of the evidence and exploration of the legal issues involved, I am not persuaded that they have no reasonable prospects of success of doing so. Evidence has not been filed."

cited,Applicant NABD of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2005] HCA 29 ; (2005) 216 ALR 1,"After setting out the passage which appears at [45] in Applicant NABD of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2005] HCA 29 ; (2005) 216 ALR 1 (per McHugh J) the writer continues: Proselytizing in Indonesia is prohibited by law where it is considered a criminal offence. Breach of such law may lead to imprisonment and other penalties. We also note that Proselytizing by Christians is viewed generally as contrary to the beliefs of Islam. The latest Report on Religious Freedom in Indonesia states that: ""The government bans proselytizing, arguing that such activity, especially in areas heavily dominated by members of another religion, could prove disruptive. A joint decree issued by the Ministries of Religion and Home Affairs in 1979 prohibits members from one religion from trying to convert members of other faiths."" Example of criminalization of proselytizing is Regulation 86UU No.23 2002 Child Protection which says: 'Any person who purposely uses deception, lies and enticement to make a child choose another religion not of his own free will, whereas it is known or should be assumed that the child is not of age and not responsible according to the religion they followed, will be prosecuted by imprisonment for five years and/or a fine of RP 100,000,0000 [sic].' It is submitted that the law criminalizing proselytizing is not a law of general application. We submit that the law prohibiting proselytizing is persecutory not prosecutory. 71 Whether a law banning proselytization is a law of general application will depend upon its terms and the way in which it is enforced. The ""example"" cited in the above extract could hardly be said to be anything other than a law of general application. It prohibits misleading conduct directed at children. There could be little doubt that such legislation was designed to serve a legitimate public purpose. A child's religion is a matter for his or her parents or guardians. However it seems to have been accepted that there is a wider prohibition upon proselytization in Indonesia, the source and terms of which are not in evidence. In particular there is no evidence as to whether the law only bans attempts to persuade persons to adopt a particular religion, or whether it also applies to attempts to dissuade persons from following one religion or all religions. In the former case it might be said that the legislation applies only to persons who wish to recruit adherents and that, in that sense, it applies only to persons who are already members of particular religious organizations. In the latter case, the application is wider and perhaps more easily characterized as being of general application. 72 For present purposes it is sufficient to note that the question of legislation prohibiting proselytization was raised by the appellant's solicitors who submitted that such legislation was not of general application. The question having been raised by the appellant, the Tribunal necessarily had to address it. I can see no basis for holding that before doing so, it was obliged to invite the appellant further to address the matter. The appellant was not entitled to assume that the question would be resolved in her favour. The Tribunal offered her an opportunity to advance her case at the hearing. No more was required. 73 On appeal the appellant again asserted that the Tribunal was obliged to give notice of its intention to find against her on the basis that the law was of general application and/or that it was appropriate and adapted to a legitimate social purpose. For reasons which I have given I reject that submission in so far as it concerns the question of general application. As to the question of whether the law was appropriate and adapted to a legitimate purpose, I consider that in raising the question of the law's general application, the appellant's solicitors inevitably raised the question of appropriateness. To attempt to distinguish between the two aspects, given the way in which the matter has been treated in the cases, would be quite artificial. There was no obligation on the Tribunal to invite the appellant further to address the issue. 74 I turn to the question of whether the Tribunal addressed the extent to which the appellant would be restricted in her chosen method of practising her religion. In my view, the Tribunal disposed of this ground by its finding that laws restricting proselytization were general laws, appropriate and adapted to a legitimate purpose, and by its finding that such harassment as the appellant might experience in Indonesia would not amount to persecution, particularly given the availability of state protection. The effect of those findings was that the appellant would be free to engage in works of mercy, subject to her complying with the law as to proselytization, and subject to the risk of low level harassment against which she would have state protection. Such findings have not been challenged. The first-mentioned limitation was not discriminatory, and therefore not persecutory. The second limitation did not amount to persecution as defined in s 91R. It follows that the appellant did not have a well-based fear of persecution for reason of her religion."
cited,Application by GasNet Australia (Operations) Pty Ltd [2003] ACompT 6 ; [2004] ATPR 41-978 ; [2003] ACompT 6,"They also distinguish Application by GasNet Australia (Operations) Pty Ltd [2003] ACompT 6 ; [2004] ATPR 41-978 ; [2003] ACompT 6 (GasNet) at [47] as directed to the need to apply the CAPM in a conventional way. According to their submissions, the Tribunal was not there suggesting that the CAPM formula could be applied only in a way that was consistent with an acceptance of its underlying assumptions. Consideration General 252 As previously noted, Telstra led expert evidence from Professor Stephen Faulkner Gray, Professor of Finance at UQ Business School, University of Queensland, and also the Managing Director of The Strategic Finance Group: SFG Consulting. Also as noted above, Optus led expert evidence from Jason Peter Ockerby, a director of the Competition Economists Group. The non-Optus access seekers led expert evidence from Dr Thomas Nicholas Hird, also of the Competition Economists Group. The three economists provided a ""Joint Report of Experts"" (Joint Report) to the Court. They also provided their own independent reports and gave extensive oral evidence. The authorities 253 The authorities referred to by Telstra (see [219] above) concerned statutory contexts different from the present one. They required that a ""value"" or a value of a particular kind or an amount of ""compensation"" be determined, and in some instances the basic expressions were elaborated upon or defined. Accordingly, the argument was open in those cases that the statute had been misconstrued. 270 I see no ground for criticism of ACCC's reasoning process by which it rejected Telstra's capital strike proposition. It was at liberty to consider that in the real world investors do not behave in the way in which the capital strike proposition would have them behave. Accordingly, in this respect ACCC did not behave unreasonably or irrationally, and neither error of law nor Wednesbury unreasonableness is made out. Inconsistency and Application by GasNet Australia (Operations) Pty Ltd [2003] ACompT 6 ; [2004] ATPR 41-978 ; [2003] ACompT 6 271 Telstra's contention that there is a fundamental inconsistency in relying on the CAPM and accepting the heterogeneity of investor expectations is well expressed at [68] of Telstra's submissions to ACCC: ...the conventional versions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model ("" CAPM ""), [to] which both the Commission and the Tribunal refer in their previous regulatory decisions, do not extend in any simple way to heterogeneous investor information and expectations. As a result, if the Commission and the Tribunal genuinely hold the view that investors have heterogeneous information and expectations, they cannot continue to rely on the models they have conventionally used to determine allowed rates-of-return. To do so would be to contradict the requirement the Tribunal has set out in earlier decisions that the CAPM be applied in a manner consistent with its underlying assumptions. The reference in the last section to ""earlier decisions"" is a reference to the Tribunal's decision in GasNet at [47]. The Tribunal there stated: The ACCC erred in concluding that it was open to it to apply the CAPM in other than the conventional way to produce an outcome which it believed better achieved the objectives of s 8.1. In truth and reality, the use of different values for a risk free rate in the working out of a Rate of Return by the CAPM formula is neither true to the formula nor a conventional use of the CAPM. It is the use of another model based on the CAPM with adjustments made on a pragmatic basis to achieve an outcome which reflects an attempt to modify the model to one which operates by reference to the regulatory period of five years. The CAPM is not a model which is intended to operate in this way. The timescales are dictated by the relevant underlying facts in each case and for present purposes those include the life of the assets and the term of the investment. The reference to ""s 8.1"" is a reference to s 8.1 of the National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems. Section 8.1 set out the objectives according to which a ""Reference Tariff"" and ""Reference Tariff Policy"" were to be designed. I do not think that the Tribunal's observation at [47] set out above is relevant to the question whether ACCC was obliged, in order to be consistent, to accept as according with the real world the assumptions according to which the CAPM was formulated. Inconsistency and the expert evidence 272 I do not find it necessary or think it desirable to attempt to describe comprehensively the effect of the totality of the evidence of the expert witnesses, but certain aspects of the Joint Report, in particular, are noteworthy. 273 The experts agreed that: the required return on equity capital cannot be estimated with great precision; the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM relies on a number of assumptions that are unrealistic, one of which is that of homogeneous investor expectations about the future prospects of each firm; the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM pricing relation can be derived adopting assumptions different from those originally employed by Sharpe and Lintner, one of those different assumptions being that investors have heterogeneous expectations about the future prospects of each firm, but other assumptions are required to arrive at the relation, and the pricing relation may hold only approximately; the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM allows investors to have heterogeneous attitudes towards risk (different levels of risk aversion); the pricing relationship used by ACCC was consistent with that originally developed by Sharpe and Lintner and also that subsequently derived from it using the assumption of heterogeneous expectations and other additional assumptions; heterogeneity of risk aversion is already allowed for in the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM."

followed,"Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437","The present and well-entrenched state of Full Federal Court authority is that a claim to refugee status is not established by those who could reasonably avail themselves of the real protection of the country of nationality elsewhere within their country of nationality: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 (' Randhawa' ) per Black CJ at 440 (cf my remarks in dissent in NALZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 320 ; (2004) 140 FCR 270 at [8] ). The question is whether the person can relocate to another area of the country, and, it is said, whether he or she could reasonably be expected to do so. However, answering this question is influenced by the principle that: 'notwithstanding that real protection from persecution may be available elsewhere within the country of nationality, a person's fear of persecution in relation to that country will remain well-founded with respect to the country as a whole if, as a practical matter, the part of the country in which protection is available is not reasonably accessible to that person' (per Black CJ in Randhawa at 442). 57 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal incorrectly took a general approach that there must be a safe haven somewhere in Indonesia, and did not consider, as a matter of practical reality, the issues raised by the appellant as required ( Randhawa at 443). The appellant submitted that the specific issues which the Tribunal was obliged, but failed to consider were: 1. the psychological difficulties of continuing to live anywhere within a country and culture in which the appellant had experienced rape on two occasions; 2. the appellant's need, as a single mother (her husband having died in January 2001), for the support of her family; 3. the appellant may face discrimination and/or harm living as a single woman with children without any family protection; 4. the appellant has never lived outside Cenkarang (apparently a suburb of Jakarta) in Indonesia as a single woman; and 5. the only family the appellant has who are outside Cenkarang live in Australia. The Tribunal did not advert to the fact that all of the appellant's relatives living in Indonesia live in Cenkarang. 58 The Tribunal also failed to take into account its finding that the incidence of rape of women in Indonesia generally is a problem and the fact of a general social prejudice against ethnic Chinese Indonesians. These are probable issues for the appellant, who would effectively be without family support. In oral submissions counsel added that the Tribunal did not take into account that the appellant may have her children with her if she relocates, unlike her experience in Australia, which had encouraged the Tribunal to regard her as a relatively resilient person. 59 The Minister denied the claim that the Tribunal merely assumed there was a safe haven within Indonesia, and argued that it is for the Tribunal to determine the significant issues in assessing the matter of relocation. It cannot be assumed that, because the Tribunal has failed to refer expressly to an issue, it has failed to consider it. The proper inference is that the issues referred to by counsel for the appellant were not considered by the Tribunal to be as significant as those the Tribunal mentioned. Also, of the issues listed by the appellant's counsel, factors (1) and (3) go to whether the appellant would want to live in Indonesia at all, rather than to whether she could relocate. Issues (2) and (5) concern the appellant's wish to have family support, which was acknowledged by the Tribunal, and issue (4) could properly be considered not to carry great weight, given that the appellant had successfully made her way in the unfamiliar cultural environment in Australia. The brevity, it was submitted, of the Tribunal's reasons on this matter 'does not detract from the breadth of the consideration'."
referred to,Yovichevich v Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists [2005] NSWSC 1208,"the time of commencement of the subject proceedings in this Court on 31 March 2005, there was already pending in the Supreme Court of New South Wales a proceedings having a similar purported context brought by the applicant as plaintiff against the College as defendant, and which had commenced in December 2004 ( Yovichevich v Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists [2005] NSWSC 1208). In relation to those Supreme Court proceedings, as well as in relation to the subject proceedings commenced in the Federal Court, the applicant pleaded causes of action purportedly based upon the absence of the grant to him of a Fellowship from the College. Unlike the Supreme Court proceedings however, no claim for damages was advanced in the subject Federal Court proceedings. The circumstantial context to the Federal Court proceedings at least largely mirrored the factual context the subject of the Supreme Court proceedings. On 30 November 2005, the Supreme Court (Adams J) found that the proceedings in that Court were defective as framed, and leave was granted to the applicant to file and serve an amended statement of claim within 28 days, failing which the Supreme Court proceedings was to stand dismissed. I will later explain in more detail the reasons for his Honour's findings. Apparently the Supreme Court proceedings has been subsequently repleaded. It is necessary to summarise the Supreme Court proceedings in force at the time at least of commencement of the Federal Court proceedings. The cause of action originally pleaded by the applicant in the Supreme Court was for breach of duty of care in relation to its conduct of examinations in radiology and pathology in which the applicant participated as a student. It appears from the reasons for judgment of Adams J that the applicant sat for examinations conducted by the College in May and November 1995 and in November 1997, and passed the examination in pathology on the last of those three occasions but failed the examination in radiology on three successive occasions. Moreover in November 1999, the applicant was examined but failed once more in radiology, and as a consequence, the applicant requested a review and reconsideration of his radiology examination results. On 9 December 1999 he was notified by the College that it was satisfied from the records of that radiology examination that the same was conducted (inclusively of marking) professionally and equitably, and that the examination outcome recorded accurately and fairly reflected the applicant's performance. Consequentially upon the applicant's short-fall in performance seemingly in relation to that examination, he failed to gain admission to the College. The causes of action pleaded by the applicant in the Supreme Court proceedings including the following averments: (i) the College did not properly or at all undertake a review of his examination performance as required by its procedures and has continued to fail to do so; (ii) the College failed to provide the applicant with a copy of examination questions and his answers thereto; (iii) the College breached its duty of care to him to conduct with reasonable care, skill, diligence and competence its relevant qualification examinations and its review and consideration as an examiner of the performance of the applicant; (iv) the College breached its duty of care to inform him of all relevant aspects of those examinations, including the criteria and method of assessment, and to administer the examinations properly and fairly and in such a way as to enable his performance to have been considered and reviewed, and by way of the provision of an effective and fair appeal process; (v) the College breached its duty of care to have proper procedures in place to ensure that the examinations, and any appeal in respect of the results thereof, would be conducted fairly, competently and impartially; (vi) the College also breached its duty of care by failing to inform him beforehand of relevant aspects of the examinations, including the criteria for assessment and the method of marking; (vii) the College failed to administer the examinations appropriately by not keeping proper and adequate notes in respect thereof, and by not having in place a procedure permitting adequate and fair reconsideration and review of his performance by reason in the meantime of its destruction of, or failure to properly safeguard or keep, the questions and answers and other documents and materials that recorded that performance, and by the way in which his performances was assessed; and (viii) in consequence of the foregoing breaches by the College of its duties said to be owed to him, compensatory damages should be awarded for his loss of income sustained from 1997 onwards for [at least] seven years, and an order should be made for his admission to the College as a Fellow."

cited,Mitchell v Bailey (No 2) [2008] FCA 692,"2 July 2008 I handed down judgment in Mitchell v Bailey (No 2) [2008] FCA 692. Having considered a petition which had been filed in the High Court and referred for trial in this Court I concluded that the Australian Electoral Officer (""AEO"") for Victoria had erred in ruling that nine ballot-papers, cast in the election for a Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of McEwen, held on 24 November 2007, were formal. I found that a further 142 votes, which the AEO had determined were informal were formal and should have been counted. As a result of these decisions I determined that the first respondent had been certified correctly as the candidate who had been elected for the Division. She had been so elected by a margin of 27 votes after the preferences of other candidates had been distributed. The parties sought an opportunity to consider my reasons before making submissions as to what orders should be made by the Court. The parties agreed on the orders which they wished the Court to make. Pursuant to O 35 rule 10 of the Federal Court Rules , they submitted minutes of consent orders on 4 July 2008. The agreed orders were: ""1. The petition is dismissed. The Commonwealth pay the Petitioner his costs of and incidental to the petition, including costs reserved by Crennan J on 21 February 2008 and any other reserved costs, on a party/party basis. The Commonwealth pay the First Respondent her costs of and incidental to the petition, including costs reserved by Crennan J on 21 February 2008 and any other reserved costs, on a party/party basis."" Written submissions were filed by all parties supporting the making of these orders. At no stage was the Commonwealth a party to the proceeding. The second respondent expressly disavowed any right to speak on behalf of the Commonwealth in relation to costs issues. For this reason I listed the matter for hearing on the question of whether a costs order could be made against the Commonwealth without the Commonwealth being afforded the opportunity to be heard. At the hearing senior counsel for the second respondent advised the Court that an appropriate officer within the Department of Finance and Deregulation had been advised of the proposed orders and would write to the Court advising that the Commonwealth did not oppose the making of such orders. By letter dated 7 July 2008 Mr Marc Mowbray-d'Arbela, the Assistant Secretary, Legislative Review Branch, Financial Management Group of the Department of Finance and Deregulation advised the Court that he was authorised ""to convey the position of the Commonwealth in relation to costs."" That position was that the Commonwealth did not object to the Court making the orders which were sought."

cited,Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333,"On 4 August 2008, the respondent's solicitors sent a letter to the solicitors for the applicant in these terms: We refer to the abovementioned matter listed to be heard before His Honour Justice Greenwood on Friday 8 August 2008, Saturday 9 August and Sunday 10 August 2008. We are instructed our clients are prepared to settle the Proceeding on the following basis (""Offer""). 1. The Proceeding be dismissed. 2. There be no order as to costs, alternatively an order that each party bear their own costs. This offer will remain open until 5.00pm on Wednesday 6th August 2008 after which time it will lapse and will not be available for acceptance by your client. In the event that this Offer is not accepted by your client and orders are made at hearing which are not more favourable then the terms of this Offer, our client will rely on this letter and produce it to the Court as and when appropriate in support of an application for indemnity, solicitor/client or party/party costs on the basis of the principles set out in Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 ALL ER 333 , Cutts v Head [1984] 1 C8 290, Mutual Community Limited v Lorden Holding Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, per Byrne J, 28 April 1993) and M T Associates Pty Ltd v Aquamax Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (3) [2000] VSC 163 , 3 May 2000. We look forward to receiving your reply ... 5 The letter was put to the applicant expressly as a Calderbank letter. It would have been plain to the applicant that the respondents were seeking to mitigate the unrecoverable costs to which they would ultimately be exposed in resisting the applicant's claim to relief by attempting to lay the foundation for a more favourable costs order should the applicant be unable to establish a right to that relief. 6 The applicant however elected not to respond to the letter. The controversy proceeded to a hearing. 7 The respondents say that the ultimate orders were more favourable than the terms of the offer. The action was dismissed with an order that the applicant pay the respondents' costs of and incidental to the action. Under the offer, the applicant could have chosen to withdraw and discontinue with no costs order against it. The applicant chose to press for the relief and the price it must pay as a matter of the proper exercise of the discretion as to costs is an order that it pay the respondents' costs of the proceeding. Thus, the ultimate orders were more favourable than the offer. 9 That assessment will take account of the complexity of the issues and the basis upon which the Court resolved the controversy. Although an applicant may have been unsuccessful in obtaining the relief sought, the applicant may have successfully resisted a significant proportion of what was said to be an answer to the relief claimed. An applicant may have established the integers of the cause of action upon which the relief is based yet relief may be refused on discretionary grounds. Although in an absolute sense, a respondent simply seeks to resist the relief sought in the proceeding and any successful ground of doing so is sufficient , the basis upon which the Court resolves the controversy assists in understanding whether an unsuccessful applicant acted reasonably in electing to proceed and thus assume the risk of a less favourable outcome than that available when choosing to go on. The letter of offer need not nor should it, engage in an analysis of the underlying contentions. The focus of the letter is to put the offer in clear and precise terms so that the recipient can understand what is offered and the Court can later see without obfuscation just exactly what was offered and rejected.

distinguished,Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430,"The duty of a judicial officer to provide reasons for decisions made, and the content of that duty, were best articulated by Meagher JA in Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430. His Honour there initially addressed the obligation to provide reasons and then the purpose of providing reasons. His Honour, at 441 2, thus observed: The obligation to provide reasons for decision. It is well settled that a judge or magistrate at first instance in particular cases has an obligation to provide reasons for the judgment given.... That obligation arises as a matter of judicial duty ... but only as a normal, not universal incident of the judicial process.... It does not arise from legislation as it does in the field of administrative law: see, for example, Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act (Cth) s13, Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act (Cth) s28, s37 and s43. ... Despite the fact that the obligation on courts to provide reasons may have a different origin, the former being an incident of judicial duty and the latter being a legislative requirement, there is no reason in principle or as a matter of policy why the content of reasons for both types of decision should not be similar, if not the same: they essentially serve the same purpose. The purpose of providing reasons for decision Perhaps the primary reason for an obligation on courts to provide reasons is the fact that a party seeking an appeal may generally only appeal where the trial judge has made an error of law. The absence of reasons or insufficient reasons may not allow an appeal court to determine whether the trial judge's verdict was or was not based on an error of law or an appealable error. However, the provision of full reasons has other benefits. A failure to provide sufficient reasons can and often does lead to a real sense of grievance that a party does not know or understand why the decision was made.... This court has previously accepted the proposition that a judge is bound to expose his reasoning in sufficient detail to enable a losing party to understand why they lost.... One reason is obvious: if decisions cannot be understood, a feeling of injustice can arise and, as Justice Brennan of the United States Supreme Court (see Huxtable, ""A Question-Mark Over The Adversarial System"" (Dee 1995) 30 (No 11) Australian Lawyer 17) recently perhaps overstated: ""...Nothing rankles more in the human heart than a brooding sense of injustice. Illness we can put up with. But injustice makes us want to pull things down."" Aside from the sense of injustice which can be caused, there is a broader interest in maintaining public acceptance of judicial decisions and the judicial system. The requirement to provide reasons can operate prophylactically on the judicial mind, guarding against the birth of an unconsidered or impulsive decision. It enhances judicial accountability. The provision of reasons has an educative effect: it exposes the trial judge or magistrate to review and criticism and it facilitates and encourages consistency in decisions. The educative effect does not stop with judges but extends to other lawyers, to government and to the public. Decisions of courts usually influence the way in which society acts and it is trite to point out that it is better to understand why one should act in a particular way. The provision of adequate reasons will save time for appeal courts both in reducing the number of appeals and in reducing the time taken in considering any appeals. Thus, any increase in judicial resources required at the trial level should be countered by a reduction in judicial resources required at the appellate level. ... 22 The position taken by the Respondent Minister, however, was essentially threefold, namely that: (i) the observations of Meagher JA in Beale as to the content of adequate reasons for a decision at first instance, do not provide an appropriate "" touchstone "" as to those matters which the Federal Magistrate was obliged to address in the present proceedings; (ii) the reasons in fact provided by the Federal Magistrate did adequately explain the decision reached; and (iii) in the event that there was a deficiency in those reasons, this Court, as a matter of discretion, should decline to allow the appeal if satisfied that the decision of the Federal Magistrate could be supported -- albeit for reasons not disclosed by the Federal Magistrate but which can be ascertained by this Court. 23 The first of those submissions must readily be accepted. There is a fundamental distinction between the responsibilities of a trial judge entrusted with the function of making findings of fact (as in Beale ) and the responsibilities of a judge conducting judicial review. Central to that distinction is that in judicial review proceedings the factual merits of the decision under review are left to the decision-maker and the court conducting the judicial review is confined to a review of the legality of the decision reached. 24 That distinction necessarily dictates a reconsideration of the approach set forth by Meagher JA in Beale. The Federal Magistrate's task in the present proceedings was to review the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. That was essentially a task of considering the terms of the relevant legislation and reviewing the conclusions expressed by the Tribunal as against the findings of fact and reasons provided. And that task is confined by s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). 25 Those matters which a Federal Magistrate, it is considered, should address in reasons for decision will depend upon the factual and legal issues involved. In those circumstances where the ground of judicial review being relied upon is a denial of procedural fairness, it may be appropriate for the Federal Magistrate to consider evidence not before the Tribunal, but evidence that is directed to the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded. That evidence may be contested and it may be necessary to make findings of fact. Where, however, the ground of review is said to be an error of law, it may be unnecessary to go beyond the findings of fact made by the Tribunal and the legislative provisions being applied. 26 Whatever the ground of review, however, the reasons of the Federal Magistrates Court must be sufficient to explain to both the litigant and others the basis upon which that Court proceeded and the reasons why the application to review the decision of the Tribunal is either to be dismissed or why the decision is said to be wrong in law. Reasons do not adequately address the grounds of review sought to be resolved if the litigant -- or this Court -- is left to speculate as to what it was that the Federal Magistrate had in mind when he reached the conclusions that formed the final decision. 50 It should finally be noted that the adequacy of reasons provided must necessarily be determined in the context of each individual case. As concluded by Meagher JA in Beale , supra , "" no mechanical formula can be given in determining what reasons are required "". The adequacy of the reasons provided by the Federal Magistrates Court must also be necessarily influenced by the volume of decisions (especially migration decisions) resolved by that Court. 51 The orders of the Court are: 1. The appeal be allowed. 2. The orders of Howard FM in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia on 17 January 2008 be set aside. 3. The proceedings be remitted to Howard FM for determination in accordance with law.

This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them ... (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation ...

cited,Rokobatini v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1238 ; (1999) 90 FCR 583,"Section 499(1) of the Act provides that the Minister may give written directions to a person or body having functions or powers under the Act if the directions are about the performance of those functions or the exercise of those powers. Section 499(2A) mandates that the relevant person or body (which includes the Tribunal: see Rokobatini v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1238 ; (1999) 90 FCR 583 at 591 (per Katz J)) must comply with such a direction. The power of the Minister under s 499(1) is limited by s 499(2), which provides that a direction must be consistent with the Act and regulations promulgated pursuant to it. 10 On 23 August 2001, pursuant to s 499(1), the Minister issued Direction No 21 entitled Visa Refusal and Cancellation under section 501 (""the Direction""). Part 2 of the Direction concerns the exercise of the discretion under s 501(2) once a decision has been made that the character test is not satisfied, a matter which is conceded by Mr Green in this case. Part 2 provides that, when exercising the discretion, ""decision-makers must have regard to"" three primary considerations, namely, the protection of the Australian community, the expectations of the Australian community and, if relevant, the best interests of any children involved. Other considerations, which are not ""primary considerations"" and are not mandatory, include the effects on the visa-holder's family, evidence of rehabilitation, the likelihood of breaching or evading obligations under a legal or other ongoing matter, the duration of the proposed stay in Australia and whether the visa is permanent or temporary. 11 Paragraph 2.5 of the Direction identifies three factors which are relevant to the protection of the Australian community. They are the seriousness and nature of the conduct, the likelihood of recidivism and whether visa cancellation would provide general deterrence. 12 Of importance to this case is the process laid down by the Direction for considering ""the seriousness and the nature of the conduct of a non-citizen"". Paragraph 2.6 outlines what the Minister views as serious offences, and paragraph 2.7 states that the sentence imposed for a crime is an appropriate indicator of the seriousness of the offender's conduct against the community. Paragraph 2.8 then provides that decision-makers must take into account certain mitigating considerations: 'When exercising discretion, decision-makers must also take the following factors into account as relevant considerations: (a) any relevant factors provided by the non-citizen as mitigating factors ; (b) the offence is not classified as an offence in Australia. ... (c) a lighter sentence would be incurred in Australia for a similar offence; or (d) the non-citizen has been pardoned' (Emphasis added.) 13 The Tribunal's reasons comprehensively set out at [10]-[76] the chronology of facts and the evidence relevant to this matter. The Tribunal summarised Mr Green's personal history, detailed his criminal record in Australia since 1978, and described the events leading up to the cancellation of his visa by the Minister and his detention on 16 August 2005. 14 The Tribunal's reasons summarised the evidence led by Mr Green, most of which pertained to Mr Green's explanation of his personal history, how and why he came to possess a criminal record, and also some mitigating circumstances. His reasons, in short, were that he had led a life of few opportunities, and that he had unfortunately been surrounded by ""bad kids, then bad adults"". The Tribunal described Mr Green's time in prison, and noted his evidence which stated that he was not a ""vicious outlaw type of criminal"", but rather more of the ""Robin Hood"" type. The Tribunal also discussed Mr Green's developing drug addiction, and the crimes he committed to support that addiction, as well as the rehabilitation which Mr Green had sought in art and family. 15 The Tribunal found Mr Green's evidence unsatisfactory in certain respects. It concluded at [53] that although Mr Green's evidence should not ""be entirely discarded, his tendency towards exaggeration and opportunistic fabrication dictates a certain caution in evaluating it."" An observation as to the need for caution in this context does not mean that Mr Green's evidence was rejected out of hand. 16 After making this finding, the Tribunal addressed the psychological and other evidence before it. Several psychological assessments of Mr Green were before the Tribunal and, although they appeared to ""differ in material respects"", the Tribunal found at [64]: 'It is difficult to derive much assistance from this part of the evidence, other than to conclude that the applicant has psychological problems, whether produced by drug abuse, incarceration, an unhappy childhood or a combination of all three. He has not to date been able to shake off anti-social or self-destructive patterns of behaviour but is not a hopeless case. He could be rehabilitated and his development of his artistic capacities, as well as his [drug rehabilitation] program are positive steps, as is the possibility of employment and of continuing his relationship with [a female friend].' 17 The Tribunal then summarised other evidence provided by friends and family of Mr Green, which detailed various matters of personal concern, including the likelihood of Mr Green obtaining employment after his release from prison, continuing an intimate relationship with a female friend, and succeeding in an artistic career."
applied,The Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2001] FCA 414 ; (2001) 108 FCR 453,"submission of Santos, Delhi Petroleum and the State that the application has no reasonable prospects of success is, in summary: (a) the Applicants do not seek a determination of native title in the present proceeding; (b) the definition of ""future act"" in s 233(1) of the NTA is that it is an act which, apart from the NTA, either validly affects (in the sense that word is to be understood in light of in s 227 of the NTA) native title in relation to the land or would, if valid, affect native title; (c) in light of Full Court's judgment in The Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2001] FCA 414 ; (2001) 108 FCR 453 ( Lardil ), to secure final relief of the kind sought by the Applicants it is not sufficient to establish only that an act might affect native title if native title were found to exist; (d) a corollary of this is that mere status as a registered native title claimant can never supply the requisite element in the definition of future act, which is also an element in any entitlement to the relief sought. The Applicants, in summary, make the following submission in response: (a) Lardil is distinguishable because it related to procedural rights conferred by s 24HA and s 24NA of the NTA and not the right to negotiate under Subdiv P of Div 2 of Pt 3 of that Act; (b) in any event, the declaration that the grant of a petroleum lease would not constitute a pre-existing rights based act does not require the Applicants to establish that they have native title because, if there is no valid ATP, it necessarily follows that there could be no valid grant of a petroleum lease. The latter submission entails some exploration of the ability of this Court to make any pronouncement in relation to the validity of an administrative actions arising only under State law. That is best considered in conjunction with the separate, jurisdictional challenge which Santos and Delhi Petroleum make. Lardil is not distinguishable. To the contrary, that case confirms, in a binding way, what a reading of the definition of ""future act"" in s 233 of the NTA would in any event suggest. That is, materially, that a future act is one which ""affects"" native title, not an act which, if native title existed, ""might"" affect it. To construe the definition in the latter way would, as French J (as the Chief Justice then was) observed in Lardil (at 473, [59]), ""require a re-writing of the statutory definition in s 233 which would significantly alter the operation of the act. Such a course is not justified by the language of a statute"". Similar sentiments are evident in the judgments of the other members of the Full Court in Lardil see p 476, [70] per Merkel J and p 486, [114] per Dowsett J. The ""right to negotiate"" claimed by the Applicants forms part (Subdiv P) of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA. Regard to the overview of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA, offered by s 24AA, also exposes the flaw in the Applicants' position. Thus, s 24AA(1) accurately informs the reader that Div 3 ""deals mainly with future acts, which are defined in s 233"" and that, "" Acts that do not affect native title are not future acts; therefore this Division does not deal with them "" (emphasis added). In turn, s 24AA(2) of the NTA offers the accurate general observation that, ""to the extent that a future act affects native title, it will be valid if covered by certain provisions of the Division, and invalid if not"". These general propositions, evident from the overview of Div 3, are expressly articulated in s 24OA of the NTA, which provides: 24OA Future acts invalid unless otherwise provided. Unless a provision of this Act provides otherwise, a future act is invalid to the extent that it affects native title. This section does not attend with invalidity a future act which might affect native title, were the same to exist. As in Lardil , the relief sought by the Applicants is final relief in a proceeding where no claim for native title is advanced. They rely on their status as the ""registered native title claimant"". Yet the advancing and successful vindication of a native title claim, not status as the ""registered native title claimant"", is, given the definition of ""future act"", just as central to the application of provisions upon which the Applicants rely as it was to those under consideration in Lardil . To seek to distinguish Lardil on the basis that the rights within Div 3 of Pt 2 with which that case was concerned were ""procedural rights"" ignores this centrality. For the purposes of s 31A of the FCA Act the Respondents have established that the Applicants have no reasonable prospect of securing any of the declaratory and injunctive relief which they seek, insofar as they rely on other than State law for any part of that relief. Jurisdiction &amp; Standing Section 81 of the NTA confers on the Court jurisdiction to hear and determine applications that ""relate to native title"". Read in isolation and as a matter of first impression and language, the jurisdiction conferred by this section appears to require nothing more or less than a relevant connection between the subject matter of an application and native title. In Lardil though (108 FCR at [156] and [68]), the conclusion was reached, after a consideration of the context in which s 81 appears in the NTA, that the section confers jurisdiction only in respect of applications under Pt 3 of that Act. This is not such an application. Perhaps recognising this, the Applicants did not point to s 81 as a source of jurisdiction to entertain their application. Instead, they adverted to s 213(2) of the NTA, to s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (Judiciary Act) and to s 21 of the FCA Act. Subject to the operation and effect of the other provisions of the NTA, s 213(2) confers jurisdiction on the Court ""in relation to matters arising under the Act"". For its part, s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act confers jurisdiction with respect to ""matters arising under any laws made by the Parliament"". The reference to s 21 of the FCA Act as a source of jurisdiction is misconceived. That section operates where some other provision has conferred original jurisdiction on the Court and, in such circumstances, empowers the Court to ""make binding declarations of right, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed"". In other words, s 21 is a source of power, not jurisdiction. Common to each of s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act and s 213(2) of the NTA is that the jurisdiction they confer is confined to the ""matters"" which those sections respectively specify. No point was taken in Lardil as to the absence in that case of a ""matter"". In the present case the amended statement of claim contains the following allegations: The applicants on behalf of the Wongkumara People are the registered native title claimant within the meaning of s 253 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NTA) in respect of land in south-west Queensland and north-west New South Wales, which land (""the Claimed Land"") is more particularly described in attachment B to Native Title Determination Application QUD52 of 2008 (as amended by leave granted by Dowsett J on 12 April 2008). The first respondent and third respondent are recorded in the register kept under s 80A of the Petroleum Act 1923 (Qld) (the Petroleum Act ) as the holder of an Authority to Prospect (ATP) 259P dated 31 January 1979 pursuant to the Petroleum Act in respect of land in south-west Queensland (the ATP Land), which land lies wholly within the boundaries of the Claimed Land. The second respondent is a Government party within the meaning of s 26(1) of the NTA for lands and water within the state of Queensland. 3A. Since the grant of ATP 259P the first and third respondents have prospected and continue to prospect for petroleum on the ATP Land including the Claimed Land. From about late 2005, representatives of the Wongkumara People and of the first respondent on behalf of the itself and the third respondent and other companies being joint venture partners of the first and third respondents have been engaged in negotiations for an indigenous land use agreement (""the proposed ILUA"") under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (NTA), which negotiations relate, inter alia, to proposed future acts under the NTA in respect of the Claimed Land covered by the ATP. 4A. The proposed ILUA is to replace an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (""the former ILUA"") that was part of an Implementation Agreement dated 16 January 2001 and which was in force for a term of five years. 4B. The former ILUA was never registered under the NTA. In the course of negotiations for the former ILUA and for the proposed ILUA the first respondent on behalf of itself and its joint venture partners has claimed that because ATP 259P predates the NTA and the grant of a petroleum lease under the Petroleum Act is a pre-existing rights based act (PERBA) within the meaning of Subdivision I of Division 3 of Part 2 of the NTA and as such is not subject to the right to negotiate provisions of Subdivision P of Division 3 of Part 2 of the NTA and should not be part of the negotiations for the proposed ILUA. Particulars Clause 9.4 of the former ILUA Letter dated 4 November 2005 from the first respondent to representatives of the Wongkumara People. The applicants have maintained that they are entitled to the right to negotiate under the NTA in respect of the grant of petroleum lease over the Claimed Land covered by the ATP and that the grant of a petroleum lease should be part of the negotiations for the proposed ILUA. Particulars Clause 9.4 of the former ILUA Letter dated 18 June 2008 from Eddy Neumann Lawyers, solicitors for the applicant, to the first respondent. ATP 259P was originally issued on 31 January 1979 for a term of four years commencing n 1 January 1979. From time to time thereafter, the term of ATP 259P has purportedly been varied, extended or renewed. Particulars (a) 22 December 1982: variation by which the term was renewed for four years commencing on 1 January 1983. (b) 18 December 1986: variation by which the term was extended for four years commencing on 1 January 1987. (c) 7 May 1991: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1991. (d) 20 September 1995: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1995. (e) 24 June 1999: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1999. (f) 12 December 2003: variation by which the term of the ATP was extended for four years commencing on 1 January 2003. (g) 3 January 2008: renewal by which the term of the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing January 2007. Read with the relief sought by the Applicants, the amended statement of claim offers, in my opinion, a paradigm example of an impermissible attempt to secure an advisory opinion. What is revealed is nothing more than a difference in contractual negotiating positions between the Applicants, who claim in other proceedings, but have not yet been determined to hold, native title in respect of the claimed land and Santos and Delhi Petroleum who may one day seek to obtain from the State a petroleum lease in respect over part of the claimed land on the strength of ATP259P. It is not pleaded that any such lease has been granted or is even imminently to be granted. In effect, what the Applicants seek is advice as to whether, were it to be determined that they hold native title and were a petroleum lease to be sought by and granted to Santos or to Delhi Petroleum by the State, that lease, if otherwise valid, would be an invalid future act if the negotiation requirements found in Subdiv P of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA were not complied with? The hypothetical nature of the application is self evident. To adapt the language employed by Zamir I and Lord Woolf in the passage quoted, the question would only be whether the Applicants, Santos and Delhi Petroleum were generally obliged to act in a certain way? Before anything more meaningful than an answer to that question could be given, the legal and factual issues just mentioned would have to be determined and occur. In Lardil (at 490, [136]), Dowsett J expressly adverted to the question of whether the Applicants in that case had standing to pursue the claim for relief insofar as it sought a declaration of invalidity under State law. His Honour doubted that they had standing. Nonetheless, he went on to consider the State law question, ultimately concluding that the decision sought to be impugned was valid. Of the other judges, French J, in the minority as to this aspect of the case, was of the view that there was no jurisdiction to determine the State law question. Though Merkel J expressed his agreement with the conclusion reached by Dowsett J as to the validity of the decision under State law, his Honour did not, in terms, expressly extend that agreement to the doubt as to standing which had been expressed by Dowsett J. In Lardil , the majority concluded that the Court had jurisdiction to decide the State law question of the validity of an act under that law because deciding that question was an essential step in any determination of whether there was a ""future act"" under the NTA. Here, the Applicants have commenced an application not materially distinguishable from Lardil which, in light of that case, is doomed to fail with respect to its Federal aspects. The essential connection with the Federal question provides the only jurisdiction which the Court could have to decide the State law question. In those circumstances, if there were jurisdiction to entertain the Federal question, the deciding of the State law question would be a matter of accrued jurisdiction in respect of which s 23 of the FCA Act would operate so as to confer jurisdiction. In light of Lardil and the fact that the present case is not materially distinguishable from that authority, the present case was doomed to fail. The Federal law aspect of the application was therefore, in the sense the term is used in the cases ""colourable"". That has the consequence that there is no jurisdiction to entertain the State law aspect of the claim, even if the Applicants had standing. Exercise of Discretion In the event that the foregoing conclusions are wrong, I should nonetheless not be disposed to the grant declaratory relief in respect of so much of the claim as remained and relied for its foundation on the State law question of whether it was lawfully possible to grant petroleum leases on the strength of ATP 259P. That would turn on a question as to whether on the particular dates pleaded there was a power of renewal in the Petroleum Act or otherwise under State law. Lardil indicates that jurisdiction would, in these contingent circumstances, exist to determine such a question in the accrued jurisdiction."
approved,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vizard [2005] FCA 1037 ; [2005] 145 FCR 57,"As the majority of the Court recognised, orders under s 206E are not susceptible of the classification that they are simply protective of the public; they have a punitive effect such that, inter alia, they give a personal defendant the right to claim privilege against self exposure as to penalties (220 CLR at 147 [37]). The effect of that decision was summarised by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vizard [2005] FCA 1037 ; (2005) 145 FCR 57 at 65 [35] as making clear that a disqualification order can be imposed not only to protect the company's shareholders against further abuse, but also by way of punishment and, importantly, for general deterrence. 51 Both McHugh J and Finkelstein J recognised that in cases of this kind the factors referred to by Santow J are cognate with the similar kinds of factors which judges sentencing in criminal matters would take into account in assessing what was the appropriate penalty for that conduct. As Finkelstein J said (145 FCR 65 [33] and see too Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Beekink (2006)57 ACSR 284 at [99] per Nicholson J): 'The sentence must be exemplary and sufficient so that members of the business community are put on notice that if they break the trust which has been reposed in them they will receive a proper punishment. It is vital, not only in the interests of the business community but in the interests of society, that leaders of that community will act honestly in all their dealings. Any slip from the high standards demanded of directors can put at risk the fortunes of their company and also the fortunes (large or small) of those who invest in them. In extreme cases, the misconduct can affect the economy as a whole.'"

cited,Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App Cas 439,"position is analogous to the situation in which parties to a contract enter into a course of negotiation which has the effect of one leading the other reasonably to suppose that the strict legal rights arising under the contract will not be enforced, or will be kept in suspense, or held in abeyance, pending the outcome of the negotiation. Here, Hoy Mobile's request of 10 July that Allphones hold a meeting on its terms, can be seen as such a suspension. In those circumstances equity would not allow the parties' strict legal rights to be enforced so as to deprive Allphones of a right to terminate the franchise agreement because it acted on Hoy Mobile's request to delay doing so: cp Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App Cas 439 at 448 per Lord Cairns LC (explaining the doctrine of equitable estoppel). Although no equitable estoppel was alleged here, a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood that nothing Allphones did after the exchange of emails on 10 July 2006 and until the meeting of 22 August 2006 amounted to an unequivocal election involving a choice between inconsistent rights."

cited,Mitchelson v Health Insurance Commission [2007] FCA 1372,"The Notice of Appeal filed on 8 May 2007 purports on its face to be an appeal to the court in its original jurisdiction from a decision of either a 'Professional Services Review Committee' ('the PSR Committee') or a 'Determining Authority' ('the Authority') established in accordance with ss 93 and 95 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ('the Act') and s 106Q of the Act respectively. For the reasons indicated in Mitchelson v Health Insurance Commission [2007] FCA 1372 , that document entirely fails as a document originating a proceeding as an appeal from a decision of either body, as no appeal lies to the court from such a decision. 4 However, as noted in the earlier Mitchelson decision, the document seeks to challenge the decision of the Authority on the ground that the Authority erred by failing to take into account relevant considerations in reaching its decision. That contention seems to be an attempt to enliven a ground of challenge that the making of the decision is an improper exercise of the power conferred by the Health Insurance Act 1973 (see s 5(1)(e) and s 5(2)(b) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth)('ADJR Act') and possibly on other grounds. 20 On 28 August, the court refused leave to amend the Notice of Appeal in terms of the amended application and made a direction that 'the applicant in the proceedings file and serve an Application supported by appropriate material for leave to amend the document described as the 'Notice of Appeal' filed on 8 May 2007 so as to properly formulate having regard to identified grounds and particulars of those grounds, an Application for an Order of Review of an identified decision for the purposes of the ADJR Act' ( Mitchelson [23]). By 28 August, the second time the question arose, 134 days had elapsed since Dr Mitchelson had received the decision material. Plainly enough, within that time, Dr Mitchelson ought to have been able to formulate precise grounds of challenge to the Authority's decision and the material facts in support of those grounds especially having regard to the statutory stay effected by s 106V(2) of the Act. The Court further directed that the application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal would be listed and heard on Tuesday 18 September 2007 at 10.15 am. When the matter came on for hearing on 18 September, the applicant relied upon a notice of motion filed on 12 September which simply sought leave to amend in terms of the same document filed on 24 August 2007. Dr Mitchelson has made no effort to reformulate the amended application to either identify with any precision the grounds of challenge or the material facts giving content and expression to those grounds. Shortly prior to Tuesday 18 September, Mr Royds sought approval to appear and argue the application for leave by telephone. Mr Royds then provided a mobile telephone number to the Court as the appropriate contact telephone number. Mr Moloney appeared in Court for the respondents. 21 Although an application in such a manner by a lawyer for a party seeking leave to amend a document such as the inadequate 'Notice of Appeal' in the context of a decision of the importance to Dr Mitchelson of the Authority's decision is unsatisfactory, ultimately the matter is one for Mr Royds against the background of the earlier Orders made in the proceeding which have not been met and the perceived strength of the argument for leave. If the material filed in support of the application is clear, precise and compelling, an election to seek and obtain approval to support the application by attendance before the Court by telephone or mobile network telephone attendance, might be thought to be cost efficient since Mr Royds practices in Cairns. However, Mr Royds did not file any reformulation of the earlier amended application and by 18 September, 156 days had elapsed since Dr Mitchelson had received the decision material with a continuing statutory stay of the Authority's directions. 22 Dr Mitchelson and Mr Royds have had more than enough time beyond the statutory 28 days prescribed by the ADJR Act to file a proper document."
discussed,Hunt Australia Pty Ltd v Davidson's Arnhemland Safaris (2000) 179 ALR 738,"The respondents relied on Hunt Australia Pty Ltd v Davidson's Arnhemland Safaris (2000) 179 ALR 738 ("" Hunt "") in support of the proposition that this proposed claim fell within the associated jurisdiction. In Hunt , a Full Court held that, on the facts of that case, a defamation claim was not completely separate and distinct from a claim under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and therefore the court had jurisdiction to decide it. The circumstances of Hunt , though different, are not completely dissimilar to the present case. The parties in Hunt were competitors and the dominant purpose of the defamatory publication was, so the court at first instance found, to injure the other party. The Court held that there was a common substratum of facts even though the publication that gave rise to the misleading and deceptive conduct claim was separate from the publication that gave rise to the defamation claim: see Hunt at 746 [30]. 12 I accept that the alleged sixth publication forms part of the one controversy and, for the reasons I am about to give, can be said to arise out of the same substratum of facts. The respondents' case is that the applicants have waged a campaign of defamatory conduct against them as part of the applicants' attempt to seize market share from the respondents. The cause of action with respect to the sixth publication is related to the other defamation claims pleaded by them. Similar factual and legal issues arise in respect of all the respondents' defamation claims. The applicants conceded that at least some of the respondents' defamation claims arise out of the same circumstances as the federal matters pleaded by them. In any case, as already noted, the applicants no longer contest the court's jurisdiction over the first to fifth defamation claims. I can discern no relevant distinction between the claim with respect to the sixth publication and the other claims. It is to be borne in mind that there is an issue as to whether the applicants were motivated by express malice in making the first publication; and there is a common temporal connection with respect to all the defamation claims and the remaining issues in the proceeding. 13 Accordingly, I would grant leave to the respondents to amend their pleading in the manner they have sought."

In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law. Such cases are, fortunately, rare. But when they occur, the court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion."

cited,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216,"Those findings were open on the evidence and are consistent with authority concerning the scope of the term 'scheme' ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 425, McHugh J; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 383, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 at 225, Gleason CJ and McHugh J [9], Gummow and Hayne JJ, 236 [43], Callinan J, 250 [85]). 76 Accordingly, having regard to the eight factors and the alternative postulate ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (supra) at 243, Gummow and Hayne JJ [66]) open on the evidence, the Tribunal concluded as was open to it, that the dominant purpose of entering into and carrying out the scheme was to obtain a tax benefit of non-inclusion of the amount of a capital gain in the assessable income of each taxpayer that would have been realised upon disposal, as contemplated by s 177C(1)(a). 77 Each taxpayer says that no tax benefit arose in connection with the scheme and thus s 177D(a) is not satisfied with the result that Part IVA does not apply to the sequence of transactions found to be a scheme. In other words, s 177D falls at the threshold and Part IVA has no application to the sequence of transactions. That result is said to arise because the statutory definition of a tax benefit contained in s 177C(1)(a) is subject to an express exclusion which removes the non-inclusion of a postulated capital gain from the assessable income of a taxpayer where the non-inclusion is attributable to the making of a choice or election expressly provided for by the 1997 Act (or the 1936 Act). 78 The relevant provisions are these. SECTION 177C TAX BENEFIT 177C(1) [Obtaining a tax benefit] Subject to this section, a reference in this Part to the obtaining by the taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as a reference to: (a) an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income where that amount would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out; or (b) ... and, for the purposes of this Part, the amount of the tax benefit shall be taken to be: (c) in the case to which paragraph (a) applies the amount referred to in that paragraph; and ... 177C(2) [Exclusions] A reference in this Part to the obtaining by the taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as not including a reference to: (a) the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income not including an amount that would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out where: (i) the non-inclusion of the amount in the assessable income of the taxpayer is attributable to the making of an agreement, choice, declaration, election or selection, the giving of a notice or the exercise of an option (expressly provided for by this Act or the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ) by any person, except one under subdivision 126-B, 170-B or 960-D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ; and (ii) the scheme was not entered into or carried out by any person for the purpose of creating any circumstance or state of affairs the existence of which is necessary to enable the declaration, agreement, election, selection, choice, notice or option to be made, given or exercised, as the case may be."
followed,Re Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson (1975) 38 FLR 184,"It is not considered that the "" final judgment or final order "" could be constituted by the order for costs made by the Supreme Court, either on its own or together with the Certificate of Determination of Costs : Franks v Warringah Council [2003] FCA 1047 , 131 FCR 287. A certificate that sets out the determination of the costs assessor, without being filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, is not sufficient to found a bankruptcy notice: Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 at [53] , 157 FCR 313 at 319 per Jacobson J. In Franks , the Land and Environment Court had there ordered that the Council's costs be agreed or assessed under the then Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW). A bankruptcy notice was served, the schedule to which stated that costs had been so assessed and annexed a certificate. Branson J summarised the submissions there being advanced as follows: [16] It was submitted by the Council that the argument that it could only recover its costs by filing in a court of competent jurisdiction a certificate issued pursuant to s 208J of the Legal Profession Act was contrary to established authority and the proper construction of the relevant legislation. The Council submitted that in respect of each order of the Land and Environment Court, having received the determination of the costs assessor, it had two options open to it for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act . The first option, it argued, was the option of filing the certificate issued under s 208J of the Legal Profession Act in a court of competent jurisdiction and issuing a bankruptcy notice on the judgment thereby deemed to have been obtained. The second option, it argued, was the option which it in fact adopted; that is, the option of issuing a bankruptcy notice founded on the order of the Land and Environment Court supported by the certificate issued under s 208J. The Council contended that the second of these options remained open to it even after it had filed in a court of competent jurisdiction the certificate issued by the costs assessor. Her Honour reviewed the authorities and then concluded: [30] The submissions of the Council identified in [16] are, in my view, unsustainable. Section 40(1)(g) does not, as it seems to me, admit of the possibility that a creditor may have obtained against a debtor more than one final judgment or final order in respect of the one debt, or perhaps more accurately, sourced from the same obligation. Further, s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act refers only to final judgments and final orders that can be enforced by a writ of execution (Re Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson (1975) 38 FLR 184 at 198 per Riley J). I incline to the view that Pt 44 r 7 of the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), as presently worded, does not allow a writ of execution to issue in respect of the orders of the Land and Environment Court on which reliance is here placed. It seems to me to be implicit in Pt 44, r 7, as presently worded, that a writ of execution may only issue in respect of costs determined under the Legal Profession Act to enforce a judgment entered as a result of the filing of a certificate under the Legal Profession Act . ... [32] I conclude that each of the bankruptcy notices should be set aside on the basis that it is fatally flawed because the judgment or order upon which it is founded, and which is attached to it as required by Form 1, is not ""a final judgment or final order, being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed"" within the meaning of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act . 36 The "" final judgment or final order "" in the present proceeding, it was ultimately submitted by the Applicant, was the judgment of the District Court. The form of a bankruptcy notice is that prescribed by reg 4.02 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth) and clause 2 to that form provides as follows: The creditor claims that the debt is due and payable by you. A copy of the judgments or orders relied upon by the creditor is attached. At the time of applying for this Notice, execution of the judgments or orders had not been stayed. If a bankruptcy notice is to satisfy the requirements of s 41(1) and (2) of the Bankruptcy Act as to form, it must correctly identify the source of the bankrupt's liability to make the payment demanded by the notice: Re Gibbs; Ex parte Triscott (1995) 65 FCR 80 , 133 ALR 718 at 721 per Drummond J. Only a judgment upon which a creditor is in a position to issue execution when he issues the bankruptcy notice can constitute a final judgment for the purposes of s 40(1)(g): cf. Pepper v McNiece [1941] HCA 27 ; (1941) 64 CLR 642 at 657 per Williams J.

An insurer under a loan protection policy refused payment because the deceased insured had falsely declared that he had never tested positive for HIV. Branson J held that no claim lay under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth). In the present case the alleged discrimination occurred before death but the claim was lodged after death. 38 In Stephenson at 296, Wilcox J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said the common law rule that personal actions do not survive the death of the plaintiff had no application where a right of action is created by statute. Guidance must be sought in the statute itself. 39 It is clear from s 60 that a complainant need not be the person against whom the discriminatory conduct was directed. Section 60(1)(f) specifically so provides. Moreover, pars (b)(ii), (c)(ii) and (d) of s 60(1) provide for complaints on behalf of classes of persons discriminated against. The Act contains no restriction on the size of the classes. It is an obvious enough possibility that between the alleged discrimination and the lodging of a complaint some members of the class might have died. 40 The orders that the Tribunal may make under s 89(1) include: (b) an order that the respondent ""redress any loss, injury or humiliation suffered by the complainant"", and (d) an order that the respondent pay ""to the complainant ... an amount the Tribunal thinks appropriate as compensation for any loss or injury suffered by the complainant and caused by the respondent's discrimination ... "". In this context, ""the complainant"" suffering the loss, humiliation, etc must be the person discriminated against, even though the complainant for the purposes of s 60 may be, as we have seen, some other person. There seems to be no logical reason, consistent with the beneficial policy of the Anti-Discrimination Act , why redress and compensation should not be ordered in respect of a deceased person. 41 Redress of humiliation (par (b)) may serve the educative function of the Act by a public finding that particular discriminatory conduct was unlawful. As Wilcox J pointed out in Stephenson at 297, the primary purpose of anti-discrimination legislation is directed towards the elimination of discrimination. An inquiry and determination by the Tribunal into a complaint may assist that purpose by a formal declaration as to the unlawfulness of the conduct concerned, notwithstanding the death of the person discriminated against. 42 Compensation (par (d)) may benefit those who have suffered financially as a result of the discriminatory conduct. To expand on the last-mentioned point, one obvious field where discrimination may occur is in employment. Indeed it is the first of the ""areas of activity"" mentioned in s 22(1). Suppose a man is dismissed by his employer on a ground prohibited by s 16(1). He cannot get another job. He has a wife and young children to support. Then he dies. It would be an odd construction of the Act which had the effect of exempting the unlawfully discriminating employer from any liability to the dependents of the deceased. 43 I conclude that Ms Campbell can bring her complaint notwithstanding that it relates to discrimination against a person who has died. Indeed, so much more should this be the case when the complaint is that there is a direct connection between the discrimination and the death."
discussed,Dacas v Brook Street Bureau (UK) Ltd [2004] IRLR 358,"The applicants drew attention to what was said to be 'the correct legal position' located within paras 52, 53 and 64 of the reasons for judgment of Mummery LJ in Dacas v Brook Street Bureau (UK) Ltd [2004] IRLR 358 (with which Sedley LJ was essentially in agreement). Brook Street was a United Kingdom Court of Appeal decision, the context whereof related to labour hire arrangements between Brook Street Bureau UK Ltd, a well known employment agency, and a local council's mental health hostel for the periodic cleaning thereof, which in the events that happened were physically undertaken at material times by the applicant Mrs Dacas. The Court of Appeal comprised Mummery and Sedley LJJ, whose reasons for decision were essentially in line, and Munby J who differed materially in what may be described as doctrinal reasoning to that of the other two members of the Court while reaching nevertheless the same ultimate decision. The difficulty to an understanding of the substrata to the appeal in its various aspects, as well as in its outcome, lies largely in relation to the procedural context to the appeal. For present purposes I will confine my consideration of the differences in principle concerning the implications of labour hire, though obiter , apparent in the reasons for decision of each of Mummery and Sedley LJJ compared to those of Munby J, and to the extent to which the statements of principle emerging from the respective reasons for judgment in Brook Street may have an operation in relation to the issues presently arising. 84 I would commence my consideration of the respective parties' approaches to the implications of Brook Street by recording that in the leading judgment, Mummery LJ observed that had the Court of Appeal been seized of all of the circumstances of the case, it may well have been open for the Court of Appeal to have found that Mrs Dacas was an employee of the local council to whom the services of Mrs Dacas had been provided by Brook Street Bureau by way of labour hire, and against which local Council their Lordships considered that her case for unfair dismissal should have been prosecuted rather than the labour hire agency Brook Street Bureau. As I foreshadowed, Sedley LJ took a similar approach in reasoning as well as in outcome to that taken by Mummery LJ. However Munby J adopted what I think may be described as the more conventional analytical approach. 85 It was in that context broadly stated that Mummery LJ made the following observations concerning the local borough Council's status as an employer or principal in relation to Mrs Dacas, which the applicants contended to be reflective of the correct approach here required to be adopted in principle: '17. The critical point is that, although the construction of the contractual documents is important, it is not necessarily determinative of the contract of service questions, as contractual documents do not always cover all the contractual territory or exhaust all the contractual possibilities. In determining the true nature of the relationship (if any) between each of the respective parties, it is necessary to consider the total situation occupied by the parties ... Although there was no express contract between the applicant and the end-user in this case, that absence does not preclude the implication of a contract between them. That depends on the evidence, which includes, but may not be confined to, the contractual documents.' ... 52. ... The formal written contracts... may not tell the whole of the story about the legal relationships affecting the work situation. They do not, as a matter of law, necessarily preclude the implication of a contract of service... There may be evidence of a pattern of regular mutual contact of a transactional character... from which a contract of service may be implied by the tribunal... . ... 53. I approach the question posed by this kind of case on the basis that the outcome, which would accord with practical reality and common sense, would be that, if it is legally and factually permissible to do so, the applicant has a contract, which is not a contract of service, with the employment agency, and that the applicant works under an implied contract, which is a contract of service, with the end-user and is therefore an employee of the end-user with a right not to be unfairly dismissed. The objective fact and degree of control over the work done by Mrs Dacas at West Drive over the years is crucial. The Council in fact exercised the relevant control over her work and over her... . The fact that the obligations were contained in express contracts made between Mrs Dacas and Brook Street and between Brook Street and the council does not prevent them from...being read across the triangular arrangements into an implied contract and taking effect as implied mutual obligations as between Mrs Dacas and the council. ... 86 CAO submitted that the foregoing analysis of Mummery LJ (and similarly that of Sedley LJ) 'falls rather short', and that '[t]he first question to be asked and answered is whether there was a contract at all between the worker and (1) the ultimate client of the labour hire agency or (2) the labour hire agency'. CAO seemingly acknowledged at the outset that in some circumstances there may be an overlap between the issue of intention to create legal relations and issues of agreement and consideration, reference being made in that regard to Carter J W and Harland D J, Contract Law of Australia (4 th ed, Butterworths 2002) p 163. In any event it was further submitted by CAO that whilst Mummery LJ did not explicitly identify what CAO described as that fundamental issue in contract law, there was conceivably 'just an echo of it' in his Lordship's reasons at [52] partly extracted above. Nevertheless, so the CAO submissions continued, his Lordship did not indicate it was necessary first to consider whether or not the relevant parties intended to enter upon legal relations. That absence of indication was said by CAO to also reside in the reasoning of Sedley LJ, where his Honour's discussion at [75] of the legal status of a worker was described by counsel for CAO as 'rather too compressed', and which reasoning had failed 'to address the fundamental questions of contractual analysis'. 87 CAO submitted further that it could not be correct, and would be contrary to Australian authority, for this Court to consider what is 'the nature of any implied contract before first answering the question did the parties intend to create legal relations', and further that '[t]he mere attendance by one party at the workplace of another does not give rise to the implication of a contract between those parties... [Sedley J's] reasoning impermissibly conflates the separate stages of contractual enquiry'. CAO further submitted, by way of contrast, that Munby J appeared to approach the case 'in a more conventional way' than was taken by Mummery and Sedley LJJ, and to have included the issue of intention 'in the mix of issues for considering what the facts actually proved including whether or not there was a contract with anyone at all'. I have explored in more comprehensive detail CAO's submissions in relation to Brook Street later in these reasons. 88 The applicants next drew attention to the decision of the United Kingdom Court of Appeal in Cable &amp; Wireless plc v Muscat [2006] IRLR 354 handed down subsequently to Brook Street , where it was found by majority that a labour hire worker was employed by the host rather than by the agency through which the host had directed that he be engaged. Whilst the applicants acknowledged the facts in Cable and Wireless were distinguishable from Brook Street , the applicants placed reliance upon the acknowledgment by the Court of Appeal in Cable &amp; Wireless upon the majority's views in Brook Street , which they submitted to be seemingly to the effect that so long as remuneration is being provided in reality by the employer, it matters not that it is not paid directly by that employer but by a third party pursuant to another arrangement made by the employer with that third party. Quoting from Cable &amp; Wireless , the applicants asserted that a person who would otherwise be the worker's employer did not cease to be his employer by arranging for the wages to be paid per medium of a third party, and further that '[t]he essentials of a contract of employment are the obligation to provide work for remuneration and the obligation to perform it, coupled with control', whether the arrangements for payment are made directly or indirectly. I will later return to a further discussion of Cable &amp; Wireless in the context of CAO's submissions. 92 It was therefore submitted by the applicants that 'the facts as to the total employment relationship demonstrate that there was an employment relationship between each of them and [CAO] from the commencement of their employment at the HVO'. Alternatively it was submitted by the applicants that 'an employment relationship came into existence before 1 July 2002', that being 'the commencement time of the claim'. Additionally, as I have foreshadowed it was submitted by the applicants that in principle, '[c]onduct which might not have manifested a mutual intention to enter into a contract had it lasted only a brief time may become unequivocal if it is maintained over a lengthy period of time', referring thereby to the reasons of Mummery LJ at [17] in Brook Street. Of course as I have already mentioned, Sedley LJ adopted a similar approach, but Munby J chose to differ. 157 I have taken the course of reviewing the United Kingdom Court of Appeal authorities of Brook Street and Cable &amp; Wireless in some detail because of the extent to which the applicants sought to place reliance upon the approach and findings apparent in the respective reasons for judgment, in the case of Brook Street referrable to the reasoning of Mummery and Selby LJJ, and in the case of Cable &amp; Wireless referrable to the approach taken generally in the joint judgment of all members of the Court of Appeal. CAO's submission was to the effect that the reasons in both decisions, other than that of Munby J in Brook Street , should not be accorded any effective, much less decisive, operation in relation at least to the relevant circumstances of the present case which CAO has outlined. I will first address CAO's submissions relating to Brook Street. 158 CAO emphasised at the outset the obiter nature of what it sought to isolate as significant aspects of the reasoning of Mummery and Sedley LJJ in Brook Street to the effect that should the tripartite arrangements the subject of consideration in those proceedings appear in the future differently structured, it may be open to an employment tribunal to find that a respondent such as Mrs Dacas was an employee of the Brook Street labour hire agency pursuant to an implied contract of service (see [68] appearing within the reasons of the leading judgment of Mummery LJ). CAO contended that obiter observations to any such effect should not be adopted by an Australian superior court. Moreover CAO drew attention to what was said to have been acknowledged by Mummery LJ at [49]-[50] to the effect that the notion of a contract of service requires the existence of at least minimum obligations as to the provision of work, and conversely of obligations to perform that work in the context of control by the provider of the work. CAO further emphasised in any event what was said by his Lordship at [49] concerning the need to eschew notions to the effect that 'an individual is an employee simply because he is not a self employed person' , but contended that '[i]f there was no interposed employment agency there would be no doubt that, even in the absence of an express contract, Mrs Dacas worked under a contract of service with the council: it was managing and controlling work done by her in the mutual expectation that she would be paid for what she was told to do and had in fact done', being a contention not at least directly relevant. 159 CAO drew attention to the purported characterisation of the so-called triangular arrangement appearing at [52]-[53] of the reasons of Mummery LJ. I have already extracted earlier (at [85] in these reasons) much of what appears in [53]; in [51] his Lordship referred to the legitimacy of having regard to ' the fact, if it be the case, that a series or a number of transactions are intended to operate in combination with one another or are ingredients of a wider transaction intended as a whole'. That approach does not sit readily with the approach taken in the Australian authorities in relation to circumstances involving labour hire operators (such as in Forstaff). CAO's contentions were in summary to the effect that the analysis of Mummery LJ (and implicitly therefore also of Sedley LJ) fell 'rather short', in that the first issue normally required to be resolved in labour hire cases, such as Brook Street , is simply whether there existed a contract at all between the worker and the client of the labour hire agency, or else between the worker and the labour hire agency. I was referred to Ermogenous and Teen Ranch , both of which involved an issue as to whether the parties mutually intended to enter into a contractual relationship, the element of intention in that regard being paramount. The respective factual circumstances in those United Kingdom and Australian cases were some distance removed from the industrial context of the relationships involved in the present proceedings. 160 CAO contended further in relation to Brook Street that neither Mummery LJ nor Sedley LJ 'clearly and crisply asked and answered' what CAO would contend to have been the critical issue, namely 'did the Council and Mrs Dacas intend to enter upon legal relations', before proceeding to consider the nature of any implied contract. CAO contended that it could not be correct, and would be contrary to Australian authority, for a court to enter upon a consideration of the nature of an implied contract before first resolving the issue as to whether or not the parties in dispute intended to create or enter upon a legal relationship in the first place. It was emphasised by CAO in that regard that merely the regular attendance by a person at the workplace of another person does not give rise to the implications of a contract between those persons, and moreover that his Lordship's reasoning geared to the doctrine of implied contracts 'impermissibly conflates the separate stages of contractual enquiry'. There is in my opinion force in principle inherent in those CAO submissions as to shortfalls in any assistance to be derived from the leading judgments in Brook Street . 161 The differing approach of Munby J, as the third member of the Court of Appeal in Brook Street , adopted at [83] what CAO described as a more conventional position in terms of authority. His Lordship's starting point was that 'the mere fact that there is a contract between the worker and the agency, and another contract between the agency and the end-user, plainly does not prevent there also being a contract between the worker and the end-user. Nor, of itself, does it prevent any contract between the worker and the end-user being a contract of service'. That approach is more in line with Australian authority and also with the United Kingdom approach taken subsequently in Viasystems in relation to what was described in the concluding sentence of [80] by Rix LJ . Where Munby J's reasoning departed at least implicitly from the approach of the other members of the Court of Appeal was in his isolation at [83] of two critical elements of an employment relationship, namely 'the obligation to remunerate and the right to control' . Munby J cited authority stating that the 'mutuality of obligation and the requirement of control on the part of the potential employer [are the] irreducible minimum for the existence of a contract of employment '. His Lordship further cited authority to the effect that ' [t] he significance of mutuality [is] that it determines whether there is a contract in existence at all' , and that ' [t] he significance of control [is] that it determines whether, if there is a contract in place, it can properly be classified as a contract of service, rather than some other kind of contract' . Moreover Munby J considered at [87] that ' [t] he requirement that there be mutuality of obligation necessarily focuses attention on the obligations (if any) undertaken by the end-user ', which his Lordship described as not inclusive of any obligation 'to provide the servant with work in addition to wages' , any such latter obligation being 'not very often to be found expressed in written contracts of employment' . 164 It was accordingly submitted by CAO that the reasoning of Munby J in Brook Street constituted 'a compelling demolition of the rather confusing approach by the majority [United Kingdom Court of Appeal] in that case', and a 'powerful cause for this Court not following that approach'. After concluding his analysis of authority, Munby J drew together at [101]-[103] (which I have reproduced below) his reasons for disagreement with the majority in Brook Street which I have foreshadowed, and in so doing, formulated an approach which CAO asserted to be here applicable to the determination of the present proceedings: '[101] Where, with all respect, I part company with my Lords is in relation to three matters. The first is the suggestion that the objective fact and degree of control over the work done by Mrs Dacas over the years is crucial. That, as it seems to me, somewhat overstates the position. And in any event it does not seem to me, with all respect, to meet the point made by Elias J in the Stephenson case. [102] The second is the suggestion that there is mutuality of obligation because the council was under an obligation to pay for the work that Mrs Dacas did for it and she received payment in respect of such work from Brook Street. In this connection [Mummery LJ] asks rhetorically, What was the council paying for, if not the work done by Mrs Dacas under its direction and for its benefit? The difficulty with this approach ... is that the council had no obligation to pay Mrs Dacas, that Brook Street's obligation to pay her arose independently of whether or not Brook Street was paid by the council, and that the Council did not set the rate of her pay. It needs also to be borne in mind that the sum contractually payable by the council to Brook Street was not simply the aggregate of the sums payable by Brook Street to Mrs Dacas and her fellow workers. It will also have included, in addition to Brook Street's profit, an element reflecting the cost to Brook Street of meeting its various obligations to the council. [103] The contract between Brook Street and the council was for the provision of services in accordance with a detailed specification and various other contractual documents ... The answer to my Lord's rhetorical question ... is that what the council was paying for was not the work done by Mrs Dacas and her fellow workers but the services supplied to it by Brook Street in accordance with the specification and the other contractual documents. The monies paid by the council to Brook Street were not payments of wages, nor were they calculated by reference to the wages payable by Brook Street to Mrs Dacas and her fellow workers. There was no mutuality.' The rhetorical question above '... what was the council paying for...' merits emphasis in particular in the light of what seems to me to be the prevailing authority at least in Australia to which I have referred, and would seek to follow. 165 Hence CAO submitted that it may 'clearly be seen', by reference to the evidence placed before this Court, that the critical elements identified by Munby J as fundamental to his Lordship's reasons for disagreement with the approach of the majority in Brook Street , and which were said by CAO to be fundamental to the resolution of the present issue arising according to the general law of Australia, require that this Court should find that there was no contract of employment made between CAO and each of the applicants. CAO identified that evidence to be in summary to the following effect: (i) there was no mutuality of obligation, CAO being under no obligation to make payment to either of Messrs Wilton or Cumberland for the work they respectively undertook at the HVO; (ii) instead the only obligation as to the payment of remuneration or other benefits to either of the applicants was an obligation which rested with MES and not CAO; (iii) moreover the obligation of MES to pay each of the applicants arose independently of whether or not MES had been or was to be paid by CAO for its supply of the applicants' services; (iv) the rates of pay which applied to each of the applicants were not set by CAO but by an industrial instrument to which MES was a party and to which CAO was not; (v) the charges levied by MES upon CAO pursuant to their discrete contractual arrangements did not simply represent the aggregate of the sums payable by MES to each of the applicants (and for that matter to any other MES supplied workers for the time being), but included a profit element for the benefit of MES and the costs otherwise incurred by MES in meeting its obligations to CAO, in relation to which Mr Touzell testified in his affidavit of 6 June 2006, being for instance costs of 'inducting' those employees at the HVO, personal protective equipment, administration costs such as processing the pay for the employees to be supplied (including of course Messrs Wilton and Cumberland), and other associated and incidental employment costs such as payroll tax and workers compensation insurance in respect of those employees so supplied; (vi) the Supply Agreement entered into between CAO and MES for the provision of services by MES to CAO accorded with a detailed specification; and (vii) what CAO was paying, purportedly in relation to the supply of services to it by MES, was not just for the work done by each of the applicants per se , but for the services supplied by MES, in accordance with the relevant specification and other contractual documents. In summary, so the CAO submission concluded, there was no mutuality of obligation between CAO and either of the applicants, and moreover there was no intention to create legal relationships between the CAO and either of the applicants; accordingly there was no contract at all between CAO and either of the applicants. 166 CAO further argued for completeness that 'the possible position left open in Brook Street' , being that the worker (Mrs Dacas) was an employee of the ultimate client of the labour hire agency, was distinguishable from the circumstances the subject of the present proceedings, because unlike the position described in the reasons for judgment of Mummery LJ in Brook Street at [64]: (i) the applicants and MES were undeniably in an employment relationship inter se ; consistently with that, MES paid to the applicants their respective wages; (ii) the role of MES was not merely that of an agency finding suitable work assignments for each of the applicants; (iii) MES provided certain clothing and personal protective equipment for use by the applicants in their working assignments in the HVO; (iv) CAO did not view MES as performing the task merely of 'staff supplier' or 'administrator of staff services'; and (v) CAO had its own individual instrument applicable to and governing its employment conditions, and what it was otherwise obliged to observe and undertake in relation to its own employees discretely from those of MES. 167 It was pointed out moreover by CAO that the United Kingdom Court of Appeal recognised in Brook Street in any event the force of the submission that control exercised by the end user in Brook Street was the product of the contractual arrangements between the labour hire agency and that end user. In that regard I was referred to [67] of the reasons for judgment of Mummery LJ, subsequent to which his Lordship acknowledged, at [68], at least the force of the arguments of Brook Street's counsel in attempted denial of the existence of any contract of service between that employment agency and Mrs Dacas. Incidentally in [67], his Lordship observed also that '[i] f the case raised policy issues as to the working conditions of people in the position of Mrs Dacas , that was a matter for legislation by Parliament and not for the courts' . 168 CAO drew further attention once more to the significance of the circumstance, that there was no contractual obligation imposed upon CAO to provide either of the applicants with work, and in that regard I was referred to Brook Street at [64]. CAO exemplified that circumstance by reference to the unavailability of work to the applicants, and hence of any requirement for them to report for work at the HVO, in the event of inclement weather or machinery breakdown, and further that it was open to CAO conversely to inform MES that it did not want a particular MES employee to work again at the mine for whatever reason (if any). 169 I would next move to a consideration of the detailed attention afforded by the parties to Cable &amp; Wireless , which I have earlier foreshadowed that I would do more extensively in the context of my recitation of CAO's submissions than did the applicants, CAO having given perhaps more extensive attention to Cable &amp; Wireless . That case was decided by the United Kingdom Court of Appeal subsequently of course to Brook Street by a different bench being Sir Anthony Clarke MR and Smith and Kay LJJ. The joint judgment of their Lordships at [35] expressed the opinion that '... the view of the majority in Dacas was correct'. It was submitted by CAO nevertheless that the decision in Cable &amp; Wireless was 'not compelling', in that the United Kingdom Court of Appeal once more did not address 'the fundamental problem of intention to create legal relations as a threshold question', or more precisely, to create a contractual relationship. In that latter regard, it was submitted by CAO that the Court of Appeal's reasoning in Cable &amp; Wireless was 'out of step with the law in Australia', exemplifying in that regard Ermogenous and Teen Ranch , and in any event, that the decision in Cable &amp; Wireless was of little relevance to the present case because of what was described as its vastly different factual circumstances. 170 The factual context to Cable &amp; Wireless was different and more complex than in Brook Street , and needs to be explained in some detail in order to provide an adequate understanding of the nature and extent of the issue which there arose for resolution, and any conceivably comparable context to that involved in the present case. The respondent Mr Muscat had been engaged as an employee of a telecommunications specialist with a company called Exodus Internet Ltd ('EIL'), when the company decided to reduce the number of its employees in order to facilitate a potential buy-out, but which nevertheless wanted to retain that worker's services. EIL informed Mr Muscat that he would have to become a so-called contractor, and to provide his services through a limited company. His employment was thereupon terminated and a company named E-Nuff Comms Ltd ('E-Nuff') was set up to receive his pay and car allowance. About three months later, EIL was effectively taken over corporately by Cable &amp; Wireless. Mr Muscat was described by Cable &amp; Wireless within the context of its organisational structure nevertheless as an employee, and he was given accordingly an employee number. The cost of all of the equipment upon or with which he worked was paid by Cable &amp; Wireless. Mr Muscat continued to submit invoices for his services provided in the name of E-Nuff. Since however Cable &amp; Wireless considered Mr Muscat to have remained associated with it, though by then as a contractor, Cable &amp; Wireless informed him that it would not deal with him directly, but that as in the case of all other contractors seeking to make arrangements for the provision of their services to Cable &amp; Wireless, he would have to engage with Cable &amp; Wireless through an agency entity called Abraxas plc, which had been retained to supply contracted personnel to Cable &amp; Wireless. On 13 August 2002, E-Nuff (at least implicitly at Mr Muscat's direction) entered into a contract for services in favour of Abraxas, which included as a retrospective element the period of time up to when Mr Muscat became aware of the requirement for him to deal with Cable &amp; Wireless per medium of Abraxas. It was that contract for services which was described as crucial to the resolution of the Cable &amp; Wireless proceedings, in that it was the case of Cable &amp; Wireless that such contract for services changed the status of Mr Muscat from that of its employee. Subsequently in late November 2002 Cable &amp; Wireless informed Mr Muscat that it would no longer require his services and on 31 December 2002 he ceased work directly or indirectly (that is, purportedly per medium of E-Nuff and no longer by himself directly) for Cable &amp; Wireless. In March 2003 Mr Muscat made a claim for compensation upon Cable &amp; Wireless for unfair dismissal. Cable &amp; Wireless contended in response that Mr Muscat was not its employee, but that contention was rejected, it being found that Mr Muscat held an implied contract of employment with Cable &amp; Wireless. The notion of implied contract of employment had been postulated by Mummery and Sedley LJJ in Brook Street . 182 As to the controversial notion of implied relationships of employment and the significance thereof adopted by the two substantially concurring members of the United Kingdom Court of Appeal in the labour hire context of Brook Street , I would conclude, as I have foreshadowed earlier in these reasons, that there is no good reason for any imputation to the present circumstances of any such notion, assuming that notion to be rightly cognisable in the general law of Australia, to the extent and for the purpose indicated in the Brook Street context of labour hire arrangements, being an association which I think to be at best doubtful. 183 It follows therefore, from what I have thus far concluded in relation to the applicants' submissions, that there are doctrinal obstacles of significant judicial precedent cognisable by the general law of Australia which stand in the way of recognition of any entitlement to the grant of the relief sought in the present proceedings. That is not to say of course that a contract of employment, whether oral or in writing, may not contain implied terms, and indeed such would I imagine normally or often be the case. Where the difficulty largely lies, as exposed by the traditional approach taken by the third judgment in Brook Street , is in imputing any implied contract of employment in circumstances of labour hire, that being a transaction which inherently constitutes dual contractual arrangements, one being between the provider of the hired worker and the hired worker, and the other being between that provider of the hired worker and a third person who hires the second-mentioned person from the labour hire provider in order to obtain the performance of work from such hired person. The implications relevantly of labour hire postulated in the reasons for judgment of Merkel J in Damevski at [174], as outlined in what is extracted in [34] above, are in my opinion apposite to the present context."
referred to,George v Hamilton-Smith [2006] FMCA 566,"The respondent applied for a review of the Registrar's decision to adjourn the hearing of the creditor's petition to 5 June 2006. On the review Federal Magistrate Raphael upheld the Registrar's decision to adjourn the hearing of the creditor's petition and in fact he altered the adjourned date from 5 June 2006 to 20 June 2006: George v Hamilton-Smith [2006] FMCA 566. The following passages from the Federal Magistrate's reasons of 21 April 2006 should be noted (at [4], [12] and [13]): '4. The debtor claims she is solvent. She says that she has tendered payment of the petitioning creditor's debt and has a substantial cross claim against Bernsteen which would effectively nullify any debt that she has to that company. Bernsteen is not in a position to make any payment to her as it is a company in liquidation. She argues that another petitioning creditor, CFS, who had initially claimed a sum in excess of $20,000.00, has had its claim reduced to some $4,297.53 which has now been paid. What the debtor does not do is provide the court with any evidence about her financial circumstances. There is no affidavit indicating what real property she owns, what is the status of her bank accounts and what other assets are owned by her. There is no evidence of other creditors. There is no evidence that it was the debtor herself who paid the CFS debt or provided the funds for the tender to the petitioning creditor. This lack of evidence meant that Registrar Christie was unable to be satisfied that the debtor was solvent and I am likewise unable to be satisfied of her solvency. As Registrar Christie said in her judgment: ""The debtor has not put before me the strong and tangible evidence necessary to establish that she is able to pay all her debts as and when they fall due (see Weinberg J in Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v Velissaris [1999] FCA 1359 at [17] ."" ... 12. Even though the existence of the proceedings may not constitute sufficient cause to dismiss the sequestration order their existence might bear heavily upon an application for adjournment. We are now in April. The proceedings between the debtor and Bernsteen are set down for hearing in May. The proceedings between the debtor and the creditor are set down for hearing in early June. I have heard nothing about any additional creditors but I am aware that the debtor has obtained an order for security for costs in the sum of $6,000.00 against Bernsteen in respect of those proceedings. It is possible, given the existence of these proceedings, that Bernsteen could obtain a similar (and probably larger) order against the debtor if she was permitted to pursue her cross claim. 13. I have taken all these matters into account when considering whether or not to adjourn this petition. As much as there is a public interest in bringing petitions to finality and thus preventing the possibility of insolvent trading or the incurring of debts a bankrupt is unable to repay there is also the fact that the making of a sequestration order has quasi criminal consequences: Re A Judgment Debtor [1908] 3 K.B. 474. It puts severe restraints upon a bankrupt's freedom of movement and ability to do business and it is these effects which must be weighed by a court considering an adjournment rather than the prejudice to the debtor or the prejudice to the creditor as suggested by Registrar Christie at [27] of her judgment. In truth evidence on both of these matters is sorely lacking but I note that the debtor has not been totally unsuccessful in her previous litigious skirmishes, e.g. in reducing the CFS debt down to a manageable figure. I am of the view that whilst the current timetable for the forthcoming proceedings remains fixed with hearings in May and June the petition should be adjourned to allow those proceedings to be heard. But if the debtor is unable to mount her cross claim without a significant adjournment or if the claim against the creditor is delayed then the rationale for the adjournment of the petition (the speedy resolution of outstanding disputes) will no longer apply. Registrar Christie was unaware of the date of the hearing of the claim in the Magistrates Court between the creditor and the debtor but I have been informed that it is to take place on 13 June. I will adjourn the petition until 20 June 2006 but I will grant the parties liberty to apply so that in the event that these hearing dates are not kept to an application can be made for an earlier hearing. The petition and any such application will be returnable before Registrar Christie.' 29 On 20 June 2006 Registrar Christie heard and refused an application for discovery by the appellant which had only been filed the day before and she made the sequestration order which was reviewed by the Federal Magistrate. 30 On 5 July 2006 Federal Magistrate Raphael heard the application for review and on 19 July 2006 he made the sequestration order which is the subject of this appeal."
cited,The Employment Advocate v National Union of Workers [2000] FCA 710 ; (2000) 100 FCR 454,"The case before me involves the application of civil remedy provisions, and penalties which can be awarded against the respondent if appropriate. In my view the issue raised by Mr Horneman-Wren may be addressed by recognising that the civil standard of proof - that is, the balance of probabilities is applicable as required by s 140(1) Evidence Act , however in applying the civil standard it is appropriate to take into account the issues prescribed in s 140(2). This does not mean that I am required to apply a higher standard of proof than the ""mere balance of probabilities"" as submitted by Counsel. It does, however, require me in this case, in applying the civil standard, to take into account the nature of the claim, the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and the gravity of the matters alleged. In particular in the context of a civil remedy provision, I take into account the fact and the nature of the penalties which can be awarded against the respondent. This approach is consistent with the approach taken by Nicholson J in Maritime Union of Australia 93 FCR at 65. The duty of the court in such cases to take into account issues specified in s 140(2) has also been recognised in other Federal Court decisions including The Employment Advocate v National Union of Workers [2000] FCA 710 ; (2000) 100 FCR 454 at 464 and Hamberger v CFMEU (2000) 104 IR 45 at 49."
cited,Tyco Australia Pty Limited v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115,"fact that O 15A incorporates a number of processes and obligations in O 15 is established by the authorities.

However, the fact that O 15A incorporates certain parts of O 15 does not mean that it incorporates all parts of the Order. Order 15A does incorporate the provisions of O 15 dealing with inspection (that is, Division 2) but that is done expressly by O 15A r 10. By contrast, O 15 r 8 is a free-standing power available in cases of discovery in existing proceedings. It is not expressly incorporated into O 15A and there is no compelling reason to think that it was intended to be available in a case where an applicant does not have sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in this Court, that is to say, an applicant for preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6. Put another way, while it might be convenient for there to be a power of the type identified in O 15 r 8 in the case of orders for preliminary discovery, it is not so obviously necessary in such cases that it can be implied in the same way as, for example, the provisions dealing with the contents of a List of Documents (O 15 r 6)."
cited,Alcoa of Australia Retirement Plan Pty Ltd v Thompson (2002) 116 FCR 139,"are three additional matters I should emphasise. First, I have emphasised that it is the review of the Trustee's decision that is of present concern. The present is not a case in which the Trustee was, in substance, deciding a question that was assigned by the Deed itself to an insurer: cf Chammas v Harwood Nominees Pty Ltd [No 1] (1993) 7 ANZ Ins Cas 61-175. Secondly, while both under the general law and under cl 3(1) of the trust deed the Trustee had no duty to give reasons for a determination adverse to Mr Kowalski, a failure to give reasons in circumstances where explanation might be called for is another matter. As Young J observed in Maciejewski v Telstra Super Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 601 at 604, in dealing with the suggestion that because a trustee is not bound to give any reasons, therefore the matter is completely unreviewable: Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, whilst trustees do not have to give reasons in a case where a plaintiff puts forward a prima facie case that the trustee's discretion has miscarried, the absence of reasons and the absence of any evidence before the Court as to what happened, will tend to make that prima facie case a virtual certainty. This view has been endorsed in many subsequent cases: see Baker v Local Government Superannuation Scheme Pty Ltd ; Hay v Total Risk Management Pty Ltd ; Alcoa of Australia Retirement Plan Pty Ltd v Thompson (2002) 116 FCR 139 at [37]; Flegeltaub v Telstra Super Pty Ltd ; see also Butler LM, ""Reviewing Trustees' Decisions: The Right to Reasons"" (1999) 7 Aust Property LJ 251. Thirdly, as the Trustee has considered Mr Kowalski's entitlement to a TPD Benefit on a number of occasions and has decided against it, an issue that presently arises is whether, if at all, it is obliged to reconsider that matter and, if so, in what circumstances. These issues have helpfully been considered by the Full Court of Western Australia in Tonkin v Western Mining Corporation Ltd (1998) 10 ANZ Ins Cases 61-397 and in a context not dissimilar from the present. In a judgment endorsed by the other members of the Court, Franklyn J made observations which though lengthy are presently relevant in several respects (at 74,270): In my view, having regard to the terms of the Deed and the relevant definition, there is no obligation on the trustee, on an application for the TPD Benefit supported by evidence inadequate to give rise to the necessary opinion, to seek out, on its own initiative, evidence for its consideration and so strain to obtain evidence relevant to the formation of the necessary opinion, thereby attempting to bring within the definition a member not otherwise within its terms. It may, however, in the exercise of its fiduciary duty and as a matter of discretion, if it considers it appropriate, seek and obtain additional medical evidence. It may also, as a matter of discretion, require medical evidence to be submitted to it for the purposes of its consideration. As trustee, it is not an adversary either for or against an applicant for the benefit. Relevantly, it has a duty only to act in accordance with the trust. If it fails to perform the same, the court will compel it to do so or do so for it. It is not bound by any rules as to how it exercises a discretion conferred on it, save such as it is obliged to comply with by the terms of the Deed, provided always that it must act honestly and in good faith, on an informed view of whether or not to exercise its discretion, and exercise the power with due consideration for the purpose for which it was conferred and for no ulterior purpose. In the case of powers conferred on it and as to whether it should do or refrain from doing something, it must exercise its judgment actively and honestly and act accordingly. The court will not control a trustee in the exercise of its purely discretionary powers unless it is acting mala fide or has misconceived the nature of its discretion and acted upon that misconception. When appointed to exercise a trust according to discretion, a trustee is not bound to state reasons for any conclusion at which it may have arrived and on which it has acted, but again the discretion must be exercised with an absence of indirect motive with honesty of intention and on a fair consideration of the issues. The duty of the court generally is to see that the discretion of the trustee has been exercised in this manner and not to deal with the accuracy of the conclusion at which it may have arrived. See Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia , 5 th Ed, p 372-379. In my opinion, it has at all times been open to the appellant to submit further medical evidence, including the reports relied on in para 17.2A to the respondent for its consideration pursuant to the Deed definition in respect of the claim for the TPD Benefit. In such case the respondent is bound to give them proper consideration. No time limit is fixed or imposed by the Deed for making application for the Benefit or for the required consideration of medical evidence. Whether any statutory limitation might apply is not relevant to our consideration as no issue in that respect has been raised. In the event of the respondent, having considered medical evidence before it, failing to form the necessary opinion there is nothing in the Deed or rules to inhibit the appellant from providing, for its further consideration, further medical evidence relevant to the formation of that opinion. There is nothing in the Deed to lead to the conclusion that, once having failed or refused to form the necessary opinion after consideration of the medical evidence then before it, the respondent is under no obligation to consider further medical evidence relevant to the formation of that opinion. Indeed, in my opinion, on the proper construction of the Deed and having regard to the fiduciary nature of the trustee's obligations, the respondent, if requested to do so, is bound to consider such evidence relevant to formation of the opinion as may from time to time be put before it. Consequently, medical evidence, whether coming into existence prior or subsequent to any particular failure or refusal to form the necessary opinion will necessarily have to be considered if made available by or on behalf of the applicant for that purpose. I should note that for present purposes the respondents have conceded that, beyond medical evidence, if other material is provided to a trustee and is of such character as would lead a reasonable trustee to consider whether or not to reconsider its former opinion, that material will have to be considered."
considered,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 1) [2003] VSC 123 ; (2003) 175 FLR 124,"On the other hand, Mandie J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 1) recognised, correctly in my view, that Fryer v Powell 159 FLR 433 laid down only a general rule capable of variation according to particular circumstances: see at [2003] VSC 123 ; (2003) 175 FLR 124 at 255, at [535]. In that case, the loss and damage suffered by the creditors of a company in their claim against the directors needed to be adjusted beyond the amount of the unpaid debt because of an interim dividend distributed by the administrator under a scheme of arrangement of the company and for a further dividend which those creditors were likely to receive. His Honour added at 256 [535]: To the extent that any allowance for actual unexpected dividends is contrary to what was decided concerning the meaning of ""loss and damage"" in Powell v Fryer (2001) 37 ACSR 589, 602-3 (sic), I understand the plaintiff to have conceded that such allowance should be made and I tend, with respect, to think that the concession was correct in principle. 34 I do not consider it is useful to import into the words of s 588M(2) a requirement that the loss and damage referred to in s 588M(1)(b) and s 588M(2) be characterised as liquidated or unliquidated. Clearly, s 588M(2) entitles the liquidator to recover the loss and damage, whatever its character, from the directors as a debt due to the company. It is the debt due to the company which entitles the liquidator to prove in the bankruptcy of the directors. Although the wording of s 588M(1)(b) and (c) indicate that the loss and damage of the creditor or creditors need not equate to the amount of the debt or debts (eg as Mandie J identified in Plymin [2003] VSC 123 ; 175 FLR 124), if there has been a distribution in the liquidation of the company to reduce that debt as at the date of the claim made in the bankruptcy by realisation of other assets of the company), s 588M(2) states that the loss and damage for the purposes of the claim against the directors be recoverable as a debt. I note that Hammerschlag J in Buzzle Operations Pty Ltd (in liq) v Apple Computer Australia Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 930 at [24] [25] adopted that position, albeit that the question was not apparently in contention before his Honour."
applied,Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8,"Having determined an appropriate level of penalty for each of the contraventions of the award, I must now look at the aggregate of those penalties ($91,300) to form a view whether that figure is out of proportion to the overall conduct of Mrs Healey; see Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 at [23] per Gray J. This exercise may also be described as did Graham J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [71] as ensuring that the figure provides an appropriate response to the conduct which led to their breaches. 31 The application of the totality principle does not mean that the figure arrived at before its consideration must be reduced. However, the Court must engage in what Gray J described in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [27] as an ""instinctive synthesis"" and arrive at a figure which Graham J said at [73] should be ""just and appropriate"". 32 The conduct which led to the breaches occurred over seven years. The only evidence before the Court to explain it is found in the agreed statement of facts at paragraphs 8 and 9 where reference is made to OWS receiving a complaint from Ms Tracey Pearce. At paragraph 9 the following is said: In her claim to OWS, Ms Pearce stated that during the course of her employment at the Theatre Royal Hotel, she was paid pursuant to wage rates contained in a purported AWA, and as a consequence believed that she had not been paid her correct rate of pay . 33 It is open to be inferred that, at least in the case of Ms Pearce, Mrs Healey attempted to apply an AWA which was inoperative for some reason relating to lack of compliance with legislative provisions concerning AWAs. There is no other evidence with respect to AWAs in which Mrs Healey is the employer. Even if the rates set were struck in accordance with incomplete AWAs, there is no evidence that any employee agreed to their terms. In any event, this does not explain other strange features of this matter such as the non-payment of Ms Jodi Buck, the downward adjustments in the rate applicable to Ms Hodgson and the attempt to give some loading to the rate of Mr Whitton but to no-one else."
cited,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 1) [2006] FCA 1101,"The respondents were represented, on the hearing of the winding up application, by Norman Carey their common director who was given leave to represent them. Mr Carey had applied to strike out the application in August 2006 on the basis that it was invalid for failure to comply with s 459Q of the Act which requires verification, by affidavit, of the currency of the debts at the time of the making of the application. On 16 August 2001 that motion was dismissed Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 1) [2006] FCA 1101. Other interlocutory orders refusing leave to issue certain subpoenas and requiring ASIC to provide a list of documents in its possession relevant to the question of solvency were made on the same day Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1193. 9 At the commencement of the substantive hearing counsel appeared for the respondents and applied for an adjournment. That application was refused. Counsel, whose instructions were limited to the application for an adjournment, then withdrew and Mr Carey represented the respondent companies in person. 10 At the hearing ASIC relied upon a number of affidavits including those of Oren Zohar and ASIC investigators, Kevin Chin and Richard Gomm. It also relied upon the affidavit of Wendy Chan, formerly an assistant accountant with Westpoint Corporation and David McEvoy, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers. The affidavits went variously to the records of intragroup debts in the books of Westpoint Corporation, the financial position of the respondents as disclosed in computer databases held by Westpoint Corporation, the way in which the accounting system operated, the service of the relevant statutory demands and of the originating process and supporting affidavits. There were no affidavits relied upon by the respondents. However Mr Carey gave oral evidence at the hearing. 28 The submissions by ASIC outlined the evidence upon which it relies in relation to each of the respondents. The factual outline in its submissions, with respect to each of the respondents, was supported by reference to the relevant parts of the affidavits filed in support of the application. It is convenient to refer to that outline in respect of each of the contested applications. It is not necessary to repeat individually the reference to the basis upon which the debts were asserted, the service of the statutory demands, the non-compliance with those demands and the currency of the relevant debts. Eastlands Pty Ltd (Eastlands) 29 Eastlands has two issued shares, one held by Heca Nominees Pty Ltd (Heca) and the other by Mr Carey. Mr Carey is the company's only director. 30 Eastlands is trustee of the Eastlands Unit Trust. The computer database containing the financial records of Westpoint Corporation and associated companies was kept on a ""Triumph"" accounting system. According to Mr Richard Gomm, an ASIC investigator, who examined records obtained by ASIC from that system in relation to Eastlands, its business records are almost exclusively concerned with its role as trustee of the Eastlands Unit Trust. The records relating to the Trust, as appears from Mr Gomm's affidavit of 16 October 2006, indicate that: (a) Eastlands Unit Trust earned no income and incurred expenses leaving a net loss before tax of $4,417.50 for the seven months to 31 January 2006. (b) At 31 January 2006 the Eastlands Unit Trust had: (i) net liabilities of $761.68 by way of a bank overdraft or debit; (ii) non-current assets comprising: an investment in land at Innamincka Road $178,000 motor vehicles and office equipment $270,000 a loan to the Quartz Trust $3,714,295 loans to various Westpoint subsidiaries and related trusts (iii) current liabilities of: Westpoint Corporation $3,594,000 Bowesco Pty Ltd (Bowesco) for the Dyson Family Trust $216,650 (iv) non-current liabilities of $96,440; (v) net negative assets of $220,460."

cited,Rodriguez v United States 480 US 522 (1987),"It may be possible to discern in Australian legislation, treaties, official guides, etc a declared antipathy to the death penalty. That antipathy, though, has not been pursued unqualifiedly in our legislation and guides in relation to dealings with foreign countries in respect of matters which could attract the imposition of the death penalty: cf the Mutual Assistance Act ss 8(1A) and (1B) and the Extradition Act 1998 (Cth) s 22(3)(c). It is unsurprising that it has not. In particular contexts, the call of other public interests may be the more powerful.

applied,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 , 205 CLR 507","the powers of the Court on appeal can only be exercised if there be appellable error. And, where an appeal is in the nature of a rehearing, the appellate Court can substitute its own decision on the facts and law as they then stand: Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40 at [23] , [2000] HCA 40 ; 203 CLR 172 at 180 to 181. Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ there made the following observations in relation to the powers of a Court when entertaining an appeal by way of a rehearing (references omitted): For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error, whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error. At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance. And the critical distinction, for present purposes, between an appeal by way of rehearing and an appeal in the strict sense is that, unless the matter is remitted for rehearing, a court hearing an appeal in the strict sense can only give the decision which should have been given at first instance whereas, on an appeal by way of rehearing, an appellate court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and the law as they then stand. Although this was a case concerning the Family Court, s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is not materially different to the equivalent provision of the Family Law Act 1976 (Cth): Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 at [75] , [2001] HCA 17 ; 205 CLR 507 at 533 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J.

cited,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 (2002) 209 CLR 597,"power the Tribunal thought it was exercising in looking at the document is not clear. If, in truth, it had completed the performance of its statutory function, the Tribunal could not look further at the merits of the case. Its adverse comments about the appellant's delay in handing up the document could not form part of any proper exercise of its powers. The Tribunal member could only have looked at the additional document for the purpose of determining whether the Tribunal's decision was tainted by jurisdictional error. If it found that there was jurisdictional error, the Tribunal could then disregard the decision and proceed to deal with the matter again. See Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 (2002) 209 CLR 597. In looking at the document, the Tribunal member wrongly concluded that the Tribunal had completed the performance of its statutory function. If it had recognised that the handing down of the decision without consideration of the additional document amounted to jurisdictional error, it could not have reached that conclusion. The Tribunal member also wrongly proceeded to determine whether consideration of the document would have altered the Tribunal's decision. The conclusion was that there was no need for the Tribunal to alter its decision. The Tribunal had no power to alter its decision. It had a power to deal with the matter afresh if it reached the conclusion that there was jurisdictional error. If it had dealt with the matter afresh, it would have been forced to decide whether it would refuse to consider the document on the ground that it was in a language other than English and untranslated. It is well-established that the Tribunal cannot refuse to consider material that is written in a language other than English.

cited,Futures Industry (NSW) Code in Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Lombard Nash International Pty Ltd (1986) 11 ACLR 566,"Commission accepted that because a card could be sent in substitution for another of the same kind, the substitute did not have to be identical with the original card. But, it argued that the words ""of the same kind"" in s 12DL(2) should be construed as meaning ""substantially of the same nature or type"" following the view of Young J on that expression as used in s 4(1) of the Futures Industry (NSW) Code in Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Lombard Nash International Pty Ltd (1986) 11 ACLR 566 at 569-570. The Commission argued that the word ""kind"" in s 12DL(2) did not relate back to just whether the card was a credit card or a debit card. This was because, it said, the definitions in s 12DL(5) did not create a bright line distinction between the two terms; indeed each card could have features of the other within their defined meanings. Thus, the Commission contended, one had to consider the functionality of each card in order to ascertain whether the cards were ""of the same kind"". This was a question of fact and degree. The Commission argued that the functionality of a Handycard was more limited than the new card. It said that the Handycard was used in a straightforward, simple manner requiring personal presence of the card holder and the use of his or her PIN to access the person's account at only two types of entry points, namely on EFTPOS or ATM machines. The Commission argued that this functionality was substantively different in kind to the broader range offered by the new card. It argued that because the new card could access different payment systems and be used by mail, over the telephone or on the internet, the risk of its unauthorised use was greater than that for a Handycard. It contended that these features amounted to a difference in kind."
applied,Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited (1991) ATPR p41-076,"primary purpose of civil penalties is deterrence: Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 per French J. Hence, in assessing the penalty to be imposed, a court will consider whether, in all the circumstances relevant to be taken into account (here under s 205F(3)), others would be deterred by the penalty and at the same time the licensee will be penalised or punished appropriately. The range of relevant matters under s 205F(3) ordinarily will include (borrowing from what French J suggested in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152-52,153): I agree with Flick J's approach to the construction of provisions like s 205F(3) of the Act. French J remarked in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 the other general objects of the criminal law apart from deterrence, namely retribution and rehabilitation, had no ""... part to play in economic regulation of the kind contemplated by Pt IV"" of the Trade Practices Act . The pecuniary penalties must put a price on the contraventions that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by Radio 2UE as the contravenor and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act and the disclosure standard: see CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 per French J. I am of opinion that there will be a substantial deterrent effect given to licensees by the penalties I will impose. The kind of contraventions that Mr Laws caused Radio 2UE to make and its inadequate attention to the requirements of compliance must be deterred if the purpose of the disclosure standard is to be upheld. I am satisfied that there will not be a repetition of Mr Laws' conduct only because he has retired from presenting his program on Radio 2UE. Radio 2UE has not had to deal with or test whether Mr Laws would now comply under its new measures. However, I am also satisfied that Radio 2UE has implemented genuine and satisfactory changes to its compliance systems that are likely to lead to compliance by its other presenters. And, I am also satisfied that no bad faith was involved on the part of Radio 2UE's management or Mr Mott. Licensees must be deterred from taking lackadaisical attitudes to compliance with their statutory and licence obligations. Takeovers and changes of control in ownership occur on a fairly regular basis in the broadcasting industry. Such events are not an excuse for a licensee to fail to comply with the Act, the disclosure standard or its licence. If Mr Mott and all the senior management were too busy to protect the very basis which generated Radio 2UE's entitlement to earn income, namely its licence, then a clear message must be sent by condign penalisation of that attitude. Such an attitude is unacceptable. It demonstrates an inattention to the public trust in commercial radio broadcasting licensees."

It is not necessary to resort to any implied power in this case. The source of the Court's power to award costs against practitioners is to be found in s 43 and O 62 r 9. The latter rule authorises costs against practitioners as a specific application of the discretion to award costs conferred by the Act.

The test is whether the disclosure in the specification will ""enable the addressee to produce something within each claim without new inventions or additions or prolonged study of matters presenting initial difficulty"": Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [25] . This requirement has been satisfied. 35 The reciprocation frequency and stroke length ranges are matters of guidance for the skilled addressee. They are not essential to the working of the claimed invention. As Maugham LJ said in No-Fume at 248, the specification does not have to define ... all the proportions, or all the dimensions, or all the temperatures, or all the materials which would give a similar or like result. 36 The preferred embodiment makes it clear that only two uses are disclosed. 37 The invention, so far is claimed in any claim, must be useful: Patents Act s 18(1)(c). This means that the invention as claimed must produce the desired result."

Traditionally they have included proprietary and financial interests (Davies J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Smithkline Beecham (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 250 at 259, Nicholson J in Allan v Development Allowance Authority (1998) 80 FCR 583 at 598). The distinction between rights which are ""private rights"" enabling commencement of proceedings by way, for example, of declaratory and injunctive relief, and ""public rights"" the enforcement of which lay at the feet of the Attorney-General, has however blurred over time to permit individuals to bring proceedings where the individual suffers special damage peculiar to himself or herself from the interference with the public right: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch at 114. Although this principle has received recognition in Australian law note for example comments of Gavan Duffy CJ, Starke and Evatt JJ in Anderson v Commonwealth of Australia [1932] HCA 2 ; (1932) 47 CLR 50 at 52; Mason J in Robinson v Western Australian Museum (1977) 138 CLR 238 at 327; Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR per Gibbs J at 526-527, Stephen J at 537-538 and Mason J at 547; Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd [1981] HCA 50 ; (1981) 149 CLR 27 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36, Davis [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18; Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association v Minister for Industrial Affairs of the State of South Australia [1995] HCA 11 ; (1995) 183 CLR 552 at 558; Allan v Development Allowance Authority 80 FCR per Wilcox J at 586-87, Nicholson J at 598 giving effect to the principle raises difficulties in itself. (A useful summary of cases, and difficulties of application of relevant principles, as existed at the time can be found in Heydon in Stein (1979) at 38-40, 45-54.) 41 Third, in order for a person to be ""aggrieved"" the test is objective, not subjective. A person does not qualify merely because he or she feels aggrieved by the conduct. He or she, in the judgment of the Court, must, in truth, be aggrieved by that conduct ( Cameron v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 46 FCR at 515) and not merely have an intellectual or emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings ( Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-548). The words do not include ""a mere busybody who is interfering in things which do not concern him: but they do include a person who has a genuine grievance because an order has been made which prejudicially affects his interests"": Attorney-General (Gambia) v N'Jie [1961] AC 617 at 634, Gibbs CJ in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 185. It is not sufficient that a person voices a particular concern and regards the actions of another as injurious to the object of that concern (Stephen J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 539, Gibbs CJ in Onus v Alcoa of Australia 149 CLR at 37). 44 Fifth, traditionally the term ""person aggrieved"" should not be interpreted narrowly: N'Jie [1961] AC at 634 , Koowarta 153 CLR at 185, Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 at 437; Ogle v Strickland (1987) 13 FCR 306 (especially Fisher J at 307-308 and Lockhart J at 314-315). Further, as Gibbs CJ said in Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd 149 CLR at 36 in relation to whether a person has a ""special interest"" sufficient to sustain litigation, The rule is obviously a flexible one since, as was pointed out in [ Australian Conservation Foundation ], the question what is a sufficient interest will vary according to the nature of the subject matter of the litigation."
cited,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang &amp; Ors [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"the extent that the appellant calls upon this Court to re-examine the underlying merits of the Tribunal's decision or consider ""afresh"" the decision reached by the Tribunal, it simply cannot do so. If the Tribunal misconceived the question to be addressed in conducting its review or failed to correctly identify the elements of the law to be applied or failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by failing to examine the central evidence relied upon by the appellant as a basis for his contended well-founded fear of persecution or failed to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act , a basis for review by this Court of the Tribunal's decision on grounds of jurisdictional error, arises. Otherwise, at least so far as this case is concerned in the context of the appellant's claims, he simply seeks a review by this Court of the underlying merits of the administrative decision of the Tribunal as an exercise of executive power. It is not open to this Court to undertake that task (see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang &amp; Ors [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey J, McHugh J and Gummow J adopting the observations of Brennan J in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35 and 36).

cited,Lawson v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517,"The adoption of a process of decision-making does not require all members of the claim group to be involved in making the decision. Nor does it require a unanimous vote ( Lawson v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517 per Stone J at [25]). The members of the claim group should be given every reasonable opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. It cannot, logically, be the case that all, in the sense of each and every member of the claim group must be involved in and agree to the proposed decision. That would, as has been pointed out in Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378 at [33] per O'Loughlin J include persons who are unable to participate by reason of age, mental capacity or unknown whereabouts and would permit an individual to prevent the progress of a claim. To cancel a meeting merely because one member is unable to attend would also constitute a waste of limited resources. The costs of holding a Njamal community meeting can exceed $13,000."

His Honour rejected the challenges to two of the three. The appellant in VBAP challenged the third basis of the decision on the ground of an alleged breach of s 424A. It was submitted that if such a breach was made out then, following the decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, the Tribunal's decision must be set aside. Responding to this submission his Honour said: "" SAAP does not stand for the proposition that if there be a breach of s 424A in relation to one ground upon which a decision is made, and there exists one or more other grounds upon which the decision is not or cannot be impeached, the decision nonetheless falls. SAAP was itself a case in which the only ground relied upon was a ground on which jurisdictional error was established. There was therefore no other basis upon which the decision in that case could be upheld. In the present case there are three other bases upon which the decision may be supported."""

There is a difference between a subsidiary carrying on its own business or whether it is carrying on the business of the parent company. At [72] his Honour observed that, where there is an integrated global enterprise, a subsidiary which is subjected to the exercise of control or influence of the parent should be viewed as carrying on business in Australia as agent of the parent. Justice Merkel emphasised the different factors that would be relevant to a determination of whether the relevant activities are those of the agent or those of the parent.

cited,"Rose v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1990) 21 FCR 241","First, the Act is remedial legislation in that it gives benefits to persons and thereby remedies Parliament's perceptions of social injustice (Social Services Consolidation Bill (Cth), Second reading speech, 15 May 1947, Minister for Health and Social Services, the Hon Senator McKenna). Accordingly, it calls for no narrow or pedantic construction: Lockhart, Gummow and Einfeld JJ in Rose v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1990) 21 FCR 241 at 244, Secretary, Department of Social Security v ""SRA"" (1993) 43 FCR 299 per Black CJ at 303 (for similar observations, I also note Director-General of Social Services v Hales (1983) 47 ALR 281 per Sheppard J at 321 and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166 at para 53). 31 Second, however, the settled rules of construction apply to the Act , and ordinary words used in the Act should receive their ordinary and natural meaning unless, in accordance with accepted rules of statutory construction, there is good reason to prefer some other meaning (Black CJ in SRA 43 FCR at 303, Rose 21 FCR at 244). 34 In relation to the concept of income being ""earned, derived or received"", it is clear that: &#8226; the use of the verbs ""earned"", ""derived"" and ""received"" in juxtaposition in the definition of ""income"" in the Act suggests that each was intended to have a different meaning: Sheppard J in Inguanti v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1988) 80 ALR 307 at 311 &#8226; income cannot be ""earned, derived or received"" unless it is also realised: Read 167 CLR per Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ at 67 &#8226; income can be realised - and hence received - even if temporarily it is not accessible: Rose 21 FCR at 245 &#8226; income can be ""derived"" within the meaning of s 8(1) even if it is not at that time received ( Inguanti 80 ALR at 311) &#8226; ""earned"" relates to personal earnings and profits ( Inguanti 80 ALR at 310)."
cited,Barton v The Commonwealth [1974] HCA 20 ; (1974) 131 CLR 477,"I do not consider that the applicants have made out any reasonable cause to believe they have an arguable case for the reading down of s 8 of the AFP Act . I should add for the sake of completeness that it may be the case that, even if the AFP Act were to be read down as contended for, it would not prevent members of the AFP from making the request they did in the absence of legislative authority: cf Barton v The Commonwealth [1974] HCA 20 ; (1974) 131 CLR 477 at 490. It is unnecessary to express any view on this. 72 A distinct way in which the applicants had proposed challenging the propriety of the AFP members' conduct in making the two requests was to contend that that conduct did not comply with the requirements of the Death Penalty Charge Guide such that, arguably, those members committed disciplinary offences under reg 4 of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations 1979. It was not made at all apparent how, even if such disciplinary offences could have been made out, this would have availed the applicants. 73 As I understand the applicants' supplementary submissions they no longer rely upon breach of the Guide and Discipline Regulations. However, I should make the following comments in any event. First, and subject to what I later say, the Guide, on its face, may well be only of indirect relevance in this matter in that its substantive content is directed to how AFP members are required to act in relation to requests for assistance made of it by a foreign country. It is silent on requests made by the AFP of an overseas law enforcement agency. Secondly even if the standards prescribed in the Guide (with appropriate adaptation) be taken as the operative ones when a request is made by the AFP and I consider this was probably their intendment the conduct of the officers concerned in this case (whoever they may have been beyond Mr Hunniford) could not properly be said to have been relevantly in breach of the Guide as it related to ""police to police"" cooperation. The requests made and the information provided pre-dated the INP investigations and the arrests and detention of the applicants. In consequence it pre-dated any ""charges being laid which may attract the death penalty"" irrespective of how the term ""charges"" should be interpreted in the Guide as it applied to the formalities of the Indonesian legal system. Finally there was, as I have indicated, authority for the AFP members to make their request under the AFP Act and that in turn was translated into a practical arrangement with Indonesia in the Police Cooperation MoU under which, according to Mr Watson, the actual requests were made. The MoU is not in evidence before me for the reasons I earlier gave. Nonetheless, counsel for the applicant was provided with the opportunity to inspect the MoU or to have the Court inspect it, but declined to take either course. Counsel for the Commissioner has nonetheless indicated to the Court that the terms of the MoU contemplated the very provision of information by the AFP in circumstances such as in this matter and it could properly be said of the MoU that there was a standing request by Indonesia for such assistance. In the above circumstances, I am prepared to accept (a) that the applicants cannot claim reasonably to believe that the information provided to Indonesia was totally unsolicited and (b) that, possibly, the AFP in providing the information was acting upon a general request by Indonesia. However, for the reasons I gave above, I do not consider it to be of any consequence whether the request was made by the AFP or by Indonesia. The AFP members acted in conformity with the Death Penalty Charge Guide. 74 Despite their various and varying formulations of a potential cause of action based on what compendiously I have called acting without lawful authority, I am not satisfied that the applicants have been able to identify or articulate any reasonable cause to believe that they are or may be entitled to obtain relief in this Court under this rubric."
cited,United Dominion Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1,"In written submissions it was suggested initially that they were promoters ""because of the clear benefits to be derived by them from a share take up in [Tiltform Australia]"". The decision of the High Court in Tracey v Mandalay Pty Ltd , (esp at 241) was in this relied upon for support by way of asserted factual analogy. Those submissions, though, went on to make the assertion of a fiduciary relationship akin to that of proposed joint venturers: United Dominion Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1. This joint venture which could only be said to be between the WA investors and Bell and Sladojevic if the alleged joint venturers' separate corporate entities (i.e. Tiltform Licensing and Tiltform Australia) were disregarded seems to be focussed on Bell's and Sladojevic's obligations as promoters of ""the benefit of their (sic) licensed product through Tiltform Australia"". I note in passing that no claim is made against Bell and Sladojevic as knowing participants in a breach of duty by Tiltform Licensing. Presumably, in this version of the joint venture, Bell and Sladojevic as fiduciaries were obliged to act in the mutual interest of themselves and the investors within the scope of the proposed venture. 258 In supplementary submissions, the ""proposed joint venture"" basis continued to be insisted upon, although apparently as an amalgam of the two previous approaches advanced, i.e. they were promoters of Tiltform Australia in the take up of the shares and of the proposed joint venture. The nature of the fiduciary duty owed in this amalgam submission is entirely unclear. Fully informed consent apart, were Bell and Sladojevic obliged to act in the interests of the proposed joint venturers (including themselves) to the exclusion of their own, several personal interests? Or were they obliged to act in the interests of the investors to the exclusion of any personal interest of their own? 259 Because of the difficulties I have in understanding how precisely the promoter fiduciary relationships are said to have been generated and what was the nature of the fiduciary wrongdoing allegedly engaged in in light of the relationships, I will give in relatively short form my own conclusions as to why I consider that there was, in the circumstances, no fiduciary relationship between Bell or Sladojevic and the WA investors. In so doing I have attempted as best I can to take account of the submissions advanced by the applicants."
applied,Parker v The Queen [2002] FCAFC 133,"As I have already noted, the applicant filed an application for an extension of time and a notice of appeal after the expiration of the time limits set for such appeals in the Federal Court Rules . Clearly it is important that parties observe time limits set by the Rules, however a discretion is vested in the Court by O 52 r 15(2) to extend time to permit a notice of appeal to be filed in order to avoid injustice where a party has missed a prescribed deadline for filing ( Parker v The Queen [2002] FCAFC 133 at pars 10-13). The applicant must however demonstrate 'special reasons' to the Court. In considering the meaning of the words 'special reasons' in this context, the Full Court of the Federal Court in Jess v Scott (1986) 70 ALR 185 observed that the facts of a case may be such as to justify the exercise of the Court's discretion: '...wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. We do not think the use of the expression ""for special reasons"" implies something narrower than this.' (at 193) 21 There are a number of guiding principles which may assist the Court in exercising its discretion under O 52 r 15(2): 1. applications for an extension of time are not to be granted unless it is proper to do so; the legislated time limits are not to be ignored. The applicant must show an 'acceptable explanation for the delay'; it must be 'fair and equitable in the circumstances' to extend time 2. action taken by the applicant, other than by way of making an application for review, is relevant to the consideration of the question whether an acceptable explanation for the delay has been furnished 3. any prejudice to the respondent in defending the proceedings that is caused by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension 4. however, the mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension 5. the merits of the substantial application are to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.

applied,Coca-Cola Company v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 ; (1999) 96 FCR 107,"In Coca-Cola Company v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 ; (1999) 96 FCR 107 ( All-Fect ) the appellant's well known 'Coca-Cola shaped bottle' mark was registered in two-dimensional form. Key features of the shape included: &#8226; its curved rather than flat sides &#8226; a top portion with longitudinal fluting &#8226; a central portion without fluting and a lower portion with fluting &#8226; a flat base and a banded neck. 47 The respondent imported and distributed cola-flavoured confectionary. The issues in suit were whether a three-dimensional shape - namely confectionary - could be used as a mark to denote the origin of goods, and whether such use infringed the appellant's registered two-dimensional trade mark. At [20] the Full Court referred to the authorities relevant to the issue of use: ... the question is whether the sign used indicates origin of goods in the user of the sign; whether there is a connection in the course of trade between the goods and the user of the sign. 48 At [31] the Court said: [T]he question at this stage is not whether the respondent has used a sign so as to indicate a connection between it and the appellant. It is whether the use indicates a connection between the confectionary and the respondent. So it does not assist the respondent to demonstrate by reference to the packaging that the suggested connection is with Efruti rather than Coca Cola. 49 These passages reflect High Court authority that a trade mark is a sign used to indicate origin of the goods in the user of that sign. Therefore, in the ordinary case, a court must first examine the use of the impugned mark and whether such use is trade mark use for the purposes of the Act. In cases such as the present this threshold issue should be determined before the court considers whether the two marks are substantially identical or deceptively similar. The threshold issue only examines the impugned mark; not the registered trade mark. As was said in All-Fect at [32], ""At this stage the hypothesis is not that the appellant is trying to tell the consumer that the goods emanate from it, but that the respondent is trying to tell the consumer that the goods emanate from the respondent"". 50 The Full Court in All-Fect held that the confectionary shape denoted use as a mark, primarily because the confectionary had non-descriptive features in the shape of the mark. The Court said at [25]: The confectionary has three features that are not descriptive of the goods. They are the silhouette, the fluting at the top and bottom, and the label band. It is not necessary for the respondent to adopt any of those features in order to inform consumers that its product is a cola flavoured sweet. It could do so by using the cola colour, the word COLA and the shape of an ordinary straight walled bottle. The silhouette, fluting and band are striking features of the confectionary, and are apt to distinguish it from the goods of other traders. The primary function performed by these features is to distinguish the goods from others. That is to use those features as a mark. It is true, as the respondent said, that the fact that a feature is not descriptive of goods does not necessarily establish that it is used to distinguish or differentiate them. But in the present case we are compelled to the conclusion that the non-descriptive features have been put there to make the goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive, and thus to distinguish them from the goods of other traders. (Emphasis added) 51 The existence of striking features that were not descriptive of the confectionary was enough to indicate that it was used as a trade mark. Features that made the goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive had the capacity to distinguish the respondent's goods from those of others. 52 At [35] the Court said that whether the respondent had used features of the confectionary as a trade mark was a matter for the court, and was not governed by the absence of evidence that shopkeepers or customers concluded that the confectionary had a trade mark origin. 61 The principles relevant to use of shape as a trade mark are now set out. (a) A special shape which is the whole or part of goods may serve as a badge of origin. However the shape must have a feature that is 'extra' and distinct from the inherent form of the particular goods: Mayne at [67], Remington at [16] and Kenman Kandy at [137] (b) Non-descriptive features of a shape point towards a finding that such features are used for a trade mark purpose. Where features are striking, trade mark use will more readily be found. For example, features that make goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive may distinguish the goods from those of others: All-Fect at [25]. (c) Descriptive features, like descriptive words, make it more difficult to establish that those features distinguish the product. For example, the word COLA or an ordinary straight walled bottle are descriptive features that would have limited trade mark significance: All-Fect at [25] and Mayne at [61]-[62]. (d) Where the trade mark comprises a shape which involves a substantial functional element in the goods, references to the shape are almost certainly to the nature of the goods themselves rather than use of the shape as a trade mark: Mayne at [63]. For example, evidence that a shape was previously patented will weigh against a finding that the shape serves as a badge of origin: Remington at [12] and Mayne at [69]. (e) If a shape or a feature of a shape is either concocted compared to the inherent form of the shaped goods or incidental to the subject matter of a patent, it is unlikely to be a shape having any functional element. This may point towards the shape being used as a trade mark: Kenman Kandy at [162] and Mayne at [69]. (f) Whether a person has used a shape or a feature of a shape as a trade mark is a matter for the court, and cannot be governed by the absence of evidence on the point: All-Fect at [35]. (g) Context ""is all important"" and will typically characterise the mark's use as either trade mark use or not: Remington at [19] and Mayne at [60]-[62]. 63 At the other end of the spectrum are those features of a mark that are non-descriptive and non-functional. They ordinarily make the shape more arresting of appearance and more attractive, thus providing a means of distinguishing the goods from those of others. All-Fect and Remington show that non-functional features add something extra to the inherent form of the shape. A concocted feature will typically be considered non-functional: Kenman Kandy . 71 In my view the Photon and the Cube shoe are used as trade marks where the features listed in [70], especially features (a), (b), (d), (g) and (h), are combined in the shape of a shoe. The most important of these features for present purposes are the stitched YD label on both shoes, the small rounded piece at the back of the Cube shoe, and the Photon's stripe running parallel to the base of the sole. Neither the Cube's rounded piece nor the Photon's parallel strip is found on any of the shoes in evidence other than YD's shoes. Mr Vickery described the rounded piece as ""quite distinctive"" and not a feature commonly used in the shoe industry. It can I think be considered a striking feature given its lack of commonality in the trade: cf All-Fect at [25]. 72 Features (c), (e), (i) and (j) in the list at [70] are either functional or in common use. Common features are like descriptive words. 73 In my view the non-functional and non-descriptive features referred to in [71] overwhelm the functional features and common features referred to in [72] and give the Cube and Photon shoes a trade mark purpose. 93 Of the essential features, the D is the most dominant feature of the Shape Mark. Significant weight and importance have been attached to that feature: cf Melbourne Chinese Press Pty Ltd v Australian Chinese Newspapers Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 38 at [18] ( Melbourne Chinese Press ) and All-Fect at [42]. 99 Finally, the context is all important. In the present case the risk of confusion is mitigated by the circumstances in which the products are bought and sold: &#8226; Purchasers of the shoes in suit are metro-shoppers. They are fashion conscious and discerning in their choices. They are likely to be well informed about the products before purchasing them. The steps involved in a purchase (see [26]) constitute a relatively lengthy process in the course of which a customer will become well informed about a product before making a purchase. &#8226; Metro-shoppers review product labels. Branding, labels and logos are important features to this class of consumer. Their purchasing habits are refined, and this lessens the chance of confusion. &#8226; YD's shoes are sold only in YD stores. The stores display YD's signage, and customers are well aware that they are in a YD store when purchasing an item. &#8226; The applicants' and YD's shoes are relatively expensive items compared with impulse products such as soft drinks and confectionary: cf. All-Fect at [41]. Purchasers of shoes generally tend to be discerning in their purchasing habits. &#8226; While it is not necessary for the applicants to lead evidence of actual deception (cf Crazy Ron's at [95]), it is relevant that there was no such evidence."
referred to,Corrs Pavey Whiting and Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434,"As far as the confidentiality agreement is concerned, Mr Atta made the following submissions: 1. The confidentiality agreement is void for uncertainty because it contains only an inclusive and not an exclusive definition of confidential information. Reading down or severance is not possible. 2. The confidentiality agreement is a restraint on competition and void as against public policy because it purports to go beyond what may be lawfully protected. Mr Atta referred to the decision in Wright v Gasweld Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 317. Again, it is said that reading down or severance is not possible. 3. As I understood it, the submission was that even in the case of a confidentiality agreement which purports to define confidential information a party complaining of a breach of such an agreement must prove the information disclosed was in fact confidential. Reference was made to the requirements in equity for the protection of confidential information: Corrs Pavey Whiting and Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 at 443 per Gummow J. There is no evidence that the information was confidential and Mr Atta said that it was not confidential. 4. The information disclosed [to THQ and Cygnett] was disclosed after Mr Atta had left the company's employ. 5. There is no pleading of loss which could conceivably flow from a breach of the confidentiality agreement. There is a claim for damages for breach of the confidentiality agreement, but the only claim for loss and damage particularised in the statement of claim relates (so it is said) to the alleged breach of the implied term. 170 I do not think the submission in paragraph 3 is right. In the case referred to Gummow J identified the elements of an equitable action for breach of confidence. His Honour was not dealing with a claim for breach of contract by disclosing confidential information as defined in the agreement. There is nothing to suggest that subject to restraint of trade considerations the parties cannot define for themselves what is confidential. They are not bound to protect no more than is already protected in equity. 171 The submission in paragraph 4 cannot succeed because the confidentiality agreement specifically purports to apply to the period after Mr Atta has left the employ of Futuretronics. 172 The submission in paragraph 5 is essentially a pleading point which I would not allow Mr Atta to raise at this late stage or at least without giving Futuretronics the opportunity to apply to further amend."
applied,Colbeam Palmer v Stock Affiliates Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 50 ; (1968) 122 CLR 25,"An account of profits is an alternative remedy to damages: see Patents Act 1990 , s 122(1). Its purpose is not to compensate the patentee, nor to punish the infringer, but rather to prevent the unjust enrichment of the infringer at the expense of the patentee: Dart Industries Inc v D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101 at 110-111. By reference to the judgment in Dart v D&eacute;cor [1993] HCA 54 ; 179 CLR 101 and the cases there cited, I have approached the calculation of the account of profits in this case on the following basis. The infringers should account for the actual profit that they have gained from the infringement. In calculating those profits, it is appropriate to deduct costs directly attributable to selling and delivering infringing articles from the revenue made from such sales and deliveries. It may be appropriate to deduct a proportion of general overhead costs such as plant, equipment and managerial costs. The deduction of such costs depends upon their being shown to have been attributable to the sales, the onus for which demonstration is upon the infringers. The account of profits is a discretionary remedy and the Court may decline to grant the remedy in respect of profits made by the infringer during the period in which it was unaware of the applicant's rights. In this latter respect, see in particular Colbeam Palmer v Stock Affiliates Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 50 ; (1968) 122 CLR 25 at 33-36 and the Patents Act 1990 , s 123 which is in the following terms: (1) A court may refuse to award damages, or to make an order for an account of profits, in respect of an infringement of a patent if the defendant satisfies the court that, at the date of the infringement, the defendant was not aware, and had no reason to believe, that a patent for the invention existed. (2) If patented products, marked so as to indicate that they are patented in Australia, were sold or used in the patent area to a substantial extent before the date of the infringement, the defendant is to be taken to have been aware of the existence of the patent unless the contrary is established. (3) Nothing in this section affects a court's power to grant relief by way of an injunction. 78 There are two possible reasons why these money sums should be varied. The first is one recognised by Colbeam v Palmer [1968] HCA 50 ; 122 CLR 25 and the Patents Act , s 123. The applicant's solicitors first wrote to the respondents on 23 February 2005, informing them of the patent and requiring undertakings. If one took 23 February 2005 as the date from which to calculate the profits, there would be no claim against the second and third respondents, the claim against the fourth respondent would be $25,051, the claim against the first respondent would be the same $83,089 and the claim against the sixth respondent would be the same $54. 79 It is important to note that in Colbeam v Palmer [1968] HCA 50 ; 122 CLR 25 , it was stated that it was for the moving party to prove the unconscionability of the profits, and therefore for the moving party that the defendant knew of the moving party's rights. The Patents Act 1990 , s 123 clearly involves discretion as to the question of refusing or discounting the award for the matters there identified. Also, s 123(2) makes plain that the defendant is to be taken to have been aware of the existence of the patent unless the contrary is shown, if patented products marked so as to indicate they are patented in Australia were sold or used in the patent area to a substantial extent before the date of the infringement. 80 The evidence discloses that the applicant's floor materials embodying the invention the subject of the patent had been distributed in Australia since late 1997. The evidence discloses that the introduction of those panels revolutionised the trade in laminated flooring and greatly expanded the market for such flooring. The evidence discloses that by 2003, when the relevant infringements commenced, the applicant's floor panels, or imitations of them, commanded over 75% of the Australian market for laminated panels. The evidence discloses that in 2003, the applicant's Australian agent and distributor sold about 312,000 packs of the floor panels, amounting to over 560,000 square metres of flooring. The evidence discloses that the panels were described as the ""industry standard"" in the October 2004 issue of a publication called "" Flooring Australia and New Zealand "". The evidence discloses that the packs of the applicant's panels were, and have been since prior to 2003, clearly marked with the words ""patented technology"", with the individual panels bearing the number of the applicant's European and United States patents. The evidence discloses that since the grant of the Australian patent on 23 November 2003, the relevant promotional material has also carried the number of the Australian patent. The evidence discloses that the fact that the applicant's floor panels are patented has always been a prominent and important feature of promotions of the panels through sales representatives, exhibitions and distribution of catalogues and brochures. The evidence discloses that the website of the applicant's Australian agent and distributor has promoted the applicant's relevant patent rights since at least early 2003. 81 The Huili respondents have not adduced any evidence in respect of the above matters. They have not established that they were not aware of the applicant's rights prior to the receipt of the letter of demand of 23 February 2005. A general assertion was made in a letter in March 2005, sent in response to the letter of demand, but that statement has not been supported in these proceedings by any direct evidence. Further, the first to fourth respondents did not plead any such lack of knowledge in their defence, which was prepared when they were represented in the proceeding by solicitors and, for a time, by experienced patent counsel. This was to be contrasted with the defence of the fifth respondent, which was prepared earlier and which was available to the first to fourth respondents and which did raise the issue. 82 In all the above circumstances, I am satisfied that under s 123 I should not make any discount by reason of innocent infringement. Indeed, if the matter were to be judged by Colbeam v Palmer [1968] HCA 50 ; 122 CLR 25, I would be prepared to conclude, based on inferences from all the above matters, that the first to fourth and sixth respondents were aware of the patent of the applicant during the course of infringement. My willingness to draw these inferences is in part based on the lack of any evidence brought forward on behalf of any of the first to fourth and sixth respondents of their ignorance prior to February 2005. 83 Also, given the state of the documentation provided by the respondents to which I have earlier referred, to the extent that there is a discretion within s 123 to deal with innocent infringement and to reduce the account of profits by the reason thereby, I am not able to be confident that the respondents have so approached the conduct of this case that they should be entitled to any discount under s 123. This last consideration is a separate consideration from the matters of proof and evidence to which I have earlier referred. 84 The second possible basis for reduction of the profits is the claim made by Mr Sun that the fifth respondent owes him or the first respondent sums of money as reflected in the cross-claim. During the course of the hearing, Mr Sun made no attempt to contest any aspect of the report of Mr Dunstan. He concentrated his submissions on what he said was the injustice of being held liable for an account of profits in circumstances where he has not been paid for a significant amount of the supplies which he or his associated entities gave to the fifth respondent. In this respect, Mr Sun made reference to the detailed material and identified a series of invoices totalling $138,901. They were as follows: Invoice Amount (ex GST) S134 $20,505 S136 $23,275 S163 $22,959 S166 $25,362 4094 $23,396 S190 $23,404 85 This total differs from the $158,000 referred to by Mr Sun in the hearing and also differs from the sum alleged in the cross claim. 86 The Huili respondents are liable to account for the profits made at the wholesale level of sales. The fifth respondent was liable to account for its profit at the next level of sale, retail sale. The fifth respondent has accounted for those profits in the order which it submitted to by consent on 22 March 2007. There is no reason in principle why the applicant should not be entitled to both the wholesale profit and the retail profit if attributable, as they are, to the infringement."
referred to,NALQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121,"It is clear from Hely J's reasons for judgment in NAHF that his Honour decided the matter upon the basis of a denial of procedural fairness rather than the content of the statutory obligation under s 425. Thus, it may be that the Full Court in SCAR misconstrued his Honour's decision; see NALQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 at [34] . However, it is not necessary for me to decide that question, even assuming that it is open to me to do so. Nor is it necessary for me to decide whether the effect of the authorities to which Hely J referred in NAHF establish that the requirements of s 425 are, as was contended by the appellant, substantive rather than formal."

The Commission relies on the following matters in support of that submission: &#8226; The investigative nature of the Commission's role in deciding whether to issue a Part A competition notice, including the ""reason to believe"" threshold; &#8226; The close connection between the institution of proceedings in a civil court and the issue of a Part A competition notice, including the institution of proceedings for the recovery of pecuniary penalties, as emphasised by Telstra in its submissions as to the effect of a Part A competition notice; &#8226; The breadth of the expression ""in connection with"" as used in para (f) of Sch 2 ( Burswood Management Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth) (1990) 23 FCR 144 at 146); and &#8226; Authority to the effect that a decision to issue a s 155 notice is not a decision to which s 13 of the ADJR applies ( Ricegrowers Co-operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman (1981) 56 FLR 443)."
cited,Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd (1995) 36 NSWLR 275,"Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd (1995) 36 NSWLR 275, which predated Goldberg v Ng and Mann , Giles J held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material, on terms of confidentiality, did not result in a loss of privilege. In Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 253, Sackville J said that it follows from Goldberg v Ng that the disclosure of a privileged communication for a limited purpose and subject to a confidentiality requirement may, or may not, amount to a waiver of privilege, depending on the circumstances of the case: at 262-263 [42]-[43]. On the facts of that case, Sackville J held that a disclosure of legal advice to the solicitors and representatives of two other companies, on strict terms as to confidentiality and for the purpose of those other companies obtaining legal advice, did not result in an imputed waiver. His Honour distinguished Goldberg v Ng as a case in which the disclosure was made to gain an advantage over the opposing party in related litigation: at 263 [45]."
distinguished,Pine v Seelite Windows &amp; Doors Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 500,"lack of evidence that any loss and damage was sustained as a result of the CFMEU's misconduct is not a factor which weighs heavily in its favour. The CFMEU relied on Pine v Seelite Windows &amp; Doors Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 500 to support this element of its case. Pine involved contraventions of s 187AA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) which prohibited an employer from paying an employee during a period when the employee was engaged in industrial action. Four employees were inadvertently paid $656.72, approximately half of which covered the period of industrial action, in breach of s 187AA. Finkelstein J noted that not every contravention of every law needs to be punished and determined not to impose any penalty in the circumstances. His Honour said at [10]: ""... No harm has been done to anyone. The contravention was inadvertent. It is unlikely to occur again. The amount of wages involved is insignificant. In these circumstances it would be quite wrong to punish the respondents. Nothing would be achieved by the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. There is no need for a specific deterrent: it is simply not necessary. And if any penalty were imposed it would be so low that it could not act as a general deterrent."" In my view, this decision does not assist the CFMEU. His Honour was dealing with a trivial and inadvertent breach of a civil penalty provision. He was not concerned with deliberate contemptuous conduct. No issue involving the undermining of the community interest in the effective administration of justice was involved. Moreover, as I have said, a penalty imposed to punish contempt is not designed to compensate for any loss suffered by those affected by the contempt. Such compensation must be sought through other legal avenues. It is usual for the Court to order that a penalty for contempt be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund not to any party who can establish that it suffered economic loss by reason of the misconduct."
cited,CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCAFC 96 ; (2007) 159 FCR 282,"terms of the facts, the starting point is an authorisation and determination made by the Board of the Australian Crime Commission (""the Board"") at a meeting of the Board held on 13 May 2003. The authorisation and determination was called the ""Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Money Laundering and Tax Fraud) 2003"" and the authorisation was expressed to be valid until 31 May 2004. I will refer to this as the 2003 authorisation and determination. It is common ground between the parties that the Board resolution making this authorisation and determination was passed at a Board meeting held on 13 May 2003 (see CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCAFC 96 ; (2007) 159 FCR 282). It appears that on 15 May 2003, the Chair of the Board signed a copy of the authorisation and determination, mistakenly asserting that it was made by resolution of the Board on 15 May 2003. The 2003 authorisation and determination was varied by a determination made by the Board by resolution passed on 4 December 2003. The determination was called the ""Australian Crime Commission Operations and Investigations (Participants) Determination 2003"". I will refer to this as the 2003 variation. Under the ACC Act, the Board may authorise in writing an investigation and may determine in writing that the investigation is a special investigation (s 7C(1)(c) and (d) and (3)). It may also determine in writing the class or classes of persons who are to participate in such an investigation (s 7C(1)(e)). In the 2003 authorisation and determination, the classes of persons to participate in the investigation were specified in Schedule 2 of the document. The purpose and effect of the 2003 variation was to make changes to the classes of persons who were to participate in the special investigation. After setting out certain preliminary matters, clause 4 of the 2003 variation stated: "" 4. Classes of persons to participate in operation (1) For paragraph 7C(1)(e) of the Act, the classes of persons to participate in the intelligence operation, or the investigation into a federally relevant criminal activity, to which an Instrument mentioned in Schedule 1 applies are the classes mentioned in Schedule 2. (2) For the avoidance of doubt, a provision in an Instrument mentioned in Schedule 1 that specifies the classes of persons to participate in the operation or investigation to which the Instrument relates is revoked and replaced by this Determination. Schedule 1 Instruments amended by this Determination (section 4) ... Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Money Laundering and Tax Fraud) 2003 ... Schedule 2 Classes of persons (section 4) The CEO. Each person who is: (a) a member of the staff of the ACC; and (b) identified in writing by the CEO, or a delegate of the CEO, as a person whose duties include providing services in relation to ACC operations and investigations. Each person who is: (a) an officer or member of the staff of any of the following agencies: (i) an agency of which a Board member is head (other than the CEO) in his or her capacity as a Board member; (ii) the Australian Taxation Office; (iii) AUSTRAC; (iv) the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; (v) the New South Wales Crime Commission; (vi) the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission; and (b) identified in writing by the head of that agency, or a delegate of that head, as a person whose duties include providing services in relation to ACC operations and investigations."""

followed,Re Lattouf (1994) 52 FCR 147,"A similar approach is reflected in the decisions of Re Sutherland-Cropper (1985) 11 FCR 156; Glass v Tarea Management (North Shore) Pty Ltd (in liq) (1990) 25 FCR 242; Re Keogh; Ex Parte Keogh v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 61 FCR 591 ( Re Keogh ); Re Lattouf (1994) 52 FCR 147 ( Re Lattouf ) ; Re Lattouf; Ex parte New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions v Lattouf [1995] FCA 752 ; and Tatt v New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions [1998] FCA 957. In each of those cases a restitution order (sometimes as a condition of a recognisance) had not been complied with following conviction for a criminal offence. Hence, s 60(1) has been found to be available to stay the enforcement of an order to make restitution, or to stay that part of the order imposing consequences for non-compliance with a condition in a recognisance requiring restitution. That approach gives effect to the purpose and effect of s 60(1) of the Act as in force since 1980 and as explained by Gibbs CJ in Storey v Lane [1981] HCA 47 ; (1981) 147 CLR 549 at 556."

First, he submitted that the Tribunal had not given to him particulars of information that it considered would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision that was under review within the provisions of s 424A(1) of the Act. The Magistrate rejected that submission on the ground that the reason for the Tribunal's decision was the inadequacy of the material provided to the Tribunal, and inadequacy of a claim is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A of the Act. The Magistrate said that inadequacy of information is no more than a subjective appraisal by the Tribunal about the material provided and a subjective appraisal of the material does not constitute information for the purpose of s 424A. The Magistrate referred to VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 and SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195."
cited,Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Page Kirkland Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 288,test is objective.

cited,South Australia v O'Shea [1987] HCA 39 ; (1987) 163 CLR 378,"the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC, each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice. The first was that the decision here was a step or stage in a process, the end result of which would entail procedural fairness ( Ainsworth per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ 175 CLR at 578; South Australia v O'Shea [1987] HCA 39 ; (1987) 163 CLR 378 per Mason CJ at 389). It was argued that the position was not dissimilar to the lack of any requirement to afford a hearing prior to the commencement of a prosecution of a like proceeding ( Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48 ; (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95; Cornall v AB (A Solicitor) [1995] 1 VR 372 at 396 397; Commissioner of Police v Reid 16 NSWLR at 461; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 3) [2002] VSC 358 ; (2002) 170 FLR 128 at 135 136). In the first place, it is doubtful whether there is a single decision making process of the kind referred to in the present circumstances. The decision by ASIC in relation to authorisation involves different questions and different issues than would a decision to issue a summons by the Court or the conduct of the proceeding itself (cf McHugh J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 473 474 and see Re Excel 52 FCR at 83 84 and 86). It is difficult to see how failure to accord natural justice in relation to the decision in question could be cured by later events. In the second place, the examination procedure is not designed to accord natural justice to a party in relation to any allegations made, directly or indirectly, against the examinee. The process is inquisitorial rather than adversarial. There is no case put against the examinee or any case in reply. As Windeyer J said in Rees v Kratzmann (114 CLR at 80): 'The honest conduct of the affairs of companies is a matter of great public concern to-day. If the legislature thinks that in this field the public interest overcomes some of the common law's traditional consideration for the individual, then effect must be given to the statute which embodies this policy.' (See also Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21 ; (1989) 166 CLR 486.) The fact that the Court maintains considerable control over the examination does not change the information gathering nature of the function being performed. The analogy with the institution of Court proceedings is not apt."
applied,Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225,"The usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order, as made, finally determines the rights of the parties. The test requires the appellate court to look at the consequences of the order itself and to ask whether it finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. Accordingly, orders refusing to set aside a default judgment or refusing to grant an extension of time are not final judgments because the unsuccessful party could make a further application for the same relief, even though such an application might have very little prospect of success (per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225 at 230 [25] ; see also per McHugh ACJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 at 2 [4] )."

So calculated, conversion damages may be awarded under s 116. The applicants accept that, on this analysis, damages under s 115(2) would be confined to indirect losses, such as the diminution of goodwill or any loss associated with the failure to enhance goodwill or reputation: see TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) (2007) 158 FCR 444 at 496 per Finkelstein J and Prior v Sheldon (2000) 48 IPR 301 at 321-22 per Wilcox J.

Obviously breaches of the rule may occur in many different circumstances and it would be quite inappropriate for the courts to endeavour to lay down a specific procedure to remedy the problems flowing from a breach no matter in what circumstances the breach occurs. Different situations will call for different remedies and in my opinion the precise procedures to be adopted when a breach of the rule occurs lies within the discretion of the trial judge. It is for him to determine whether a breach has occurred and, if so, what steps should be taken to ensure that the trial does not miscarry. He may, for example, require the relevant witness to be recalled for further cross-examination before allowing the contradictory evidence to be given or he may decline to allow the party in default to address upon a particular subject upon which the opposing party was not cross-examined: see, eg, Precision Plastics Pty Ltd v Demir [1975] HCA 27 ; (1975) 132 CLR 362. The decision will, in each case, involve a balancing of competing considerations and lies essentially within the discretion of the trial judge.""

The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial; (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

However, that admission is made subject to paragraphs 8 and 9, which deny that Rosanza is entitled to any relief sought due. This non-entitlement, it is said, is due to Peninsula's claims in the principal proceeding, or to the contention that the rent and other payments due under the Lease were abated to nil from the commencement of the Lease by reason of clause 11."
distinguished,Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design &amp; Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 229 CLR 577,"The appellant also relied on the observations of Kirby and Crennan JJ in Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design &amp; Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 229 CLR 577 at [59] and [69] to [73].

It is true that at [60] their Honours referred to a line of patent cases where an implied licence to use and repair a patented item has been upheld as an implied licence that runs with the patented item itself.

cited,Applicant S1140/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 526,"It is unnecessary to set out again the factual and procedural history which is set out in the reasons for judgment published on 1 May 2006 Applicant S1140/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 526. These reasons, should be read together with those, for that purpose. 9 The husband, in the presence of his wife, and with her authority confirmed orally in Court, made submissions on behalf of both of them in support of their applications for leave to appeal against the learned magistrate's decisions. However, nothing that was said in support of those applications identified any error in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrates Court which would warrant the grant of such leave. As previously observed, the proposed draft notice of appeal does not disclose any viable grounds for a proposed appeal. There was reference to other cases in which it was said applicants had been allowed to proceed in the Federal Magistrates Court but there was no principle proposed, emerging from those cases, which suggested they would be of any assistance in this case. 10 A matter which was drawn to my attention by counsel for the respondent, and which was not dealt with in the previously published reasons, was that the wife's application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court had been amended on or about 4 May 2005. A copy of the amended application appears in the Appeal Book relating to the wife. I assume that an amended application in like terms was filed in the husband's name. The amended application for judicial review of the Tribunal's 1998 decision asserts in substance that the Tribunal misconstrued the concept of persecution and ignored an important integer of the applicants' claim. It makes reference to s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which was not in force at the time of the Tribunal's decision. 11 The grounds of the amended application do not assist the applicants. Indeed they strengthen the proposition that the proceedings in this case were an abuse of process because they canvass matters which clearly were, or could have been, raised before Mathews J in 1998. 12 I am satisfied that there is no merit in the proposed appeal and that the Magistrate correctly found that the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court amounted to an abuse of process.

cited,Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404,"There are four determinations under the Land Rights Act that are of particular significance so far as the claimants are concerned. Those findings were all generally favourable to the indigenous groups that instituted the land claims. Section 86 of the NT Act renders them admissible in these proceedings as ""the transcript of evidence in any other proceedings before ... any other person or body"": Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 per Mansfield J (at [431]-[432]) ("" Risk ""). The four determinations are as follows, in chronological order: &#8226; Timber Creek Land Claim Report No 21 (19 April 1985) Commissioner Maurice &#8226; Kidman Springs/Jasper Gorge Land Claim Report No 30 (31 March 1989) Justice Olney &#8226; Stokes Range Land Claim Report No 36 (28 June 1990) Justice Olney &#8226; Ngaliwurru/Nungali (Fitzroy Pastoral Lease) Land Claim No 137 and Victoria River (Bed and Banks) Land Claim No 140 Report No 47 (22 December 1993) Justice Gray 76 This land claim arose out of an application by the Northern Land Council in 1981. Its original intention was to claim only the Timber Creek Commonage Reserve (""the Reserve""). However, before the inquiry commenced the application was twice amended so as to include all those parts of the bed and banks of the Victoria River between the eastern and western boundaries of the Reserve which did not form part of the town of Timber Creek. At a later stage of the inquiry, the claimants withdrew so much of the claim as related to the bed of the river, and its northern bank. However, they maintained the claim to the southern bank, immediately adjoining the Reserve. 77 There were 163 claimants in all. They were presented as one group, comprising six sub-groups, each of which was associated with a separate tract of land. During the course of the proceeding, the senior members of the sub-group identified the country with which that sub-group was associated by referring to a focal site, and by associating that tract of land with a named male person. 144 In Risk , Mansfield J observed that the High Court's decision in Yorta Yorta imposed a requirement of continuity on both the aboriginal society, and on the acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs that are claimed to give rise to the rights and interests under the NT Act . His Honour stated (at [56]): ""Laws and customs do not exist in a vacuum they 'arise out of and, in important respects, go to define a particular society': Yorta Yorta at [49], [55]. In this context, 'society' is to be 'understood as a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of laws and customs': at [49]. If the society ceases to exist, then so too do its traditional laws and customs, from which rights and interests arise: at [50]. Once a society has ceased to exist, it is not possible for descendants of that society to take up again the 'traditional' laws and customs as those expressions are used in the NT Act : [51]-[52]. As the majority said in Yorta Yorta at [53]: 'When the society whose laws or customs existed at sovereignty ceases to exist, the rights and interests in land to which these laws and customs gave rise, cease to exist. If the content of the former laws and customs is later adopted by some new society, those laws and customs will then owe their new life to that other, later, society and they are the laws acknowledged by, and customs observed by, that later society , they are not laws and customs which can now properly now be described as being the existing laws and customs of the earlier society. The rights and interests in land to which the re-adopted laws and customs give rise are rights and interests which are not rooted in pre-sovereignty traditional law and custom but in the laws and customs of the new society.'"" 537 His Honour's reference to the ""tide of history"" having been washed away was applied by Olney J, at first instance, in Yorta Yorta . There the application for a determination of native title failed because the evidence did not establish possession of tribal lands, or an observation of laws and customs based on tradition, that could provide a basis for a native title claim. In other words, the particular claimants had ceased to be a traditional indigenous community. Likewise, in Risk , Mansfield J found that the current laws and customs of the Larrakia people were not ""traditional"" in the sense required by s 223(1) , as explained by the High Court in Yorta Yorta ."

considered,Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574,"Commonwealth's submission was that it could not possibly be said that it had acted for, or on behalf of, Mr Habib. This submission is too simplistic. It is accepted that there is some kind of duty owed by the State to its overseas nationals. For example, in Mutasa v Attorney General [1980] QB 114 at 118-120 Boreham J spoke of the Crown having a duty to protect a citizen from unlawful detention but of that duty being one of imperfect obligation and thus unenforceable. So too, in China Navigation Company Ltd v Attorney General (1931) 40 Ll L Rep 110 at 112 Rowlatt J spoke of an alleged duty to assist a citizen against piracy as being but a ""political"" duty: cf. Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574 at 593-594 [62] - [66] per Tamberlin J. Thus, it is a little glib to say that there was no aspect of the relationship between Mr Habib and the Commonwealth which could involve it in potentially ""acting"" on his behalf. I have no doubt that the first duty does not exist, in the sense that it is not a ""duty at law"", although it may exist as an unenforceable political duty of imperfect obligation: Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574 at 593-594 [62] - [66] per Tamberlin J. To embark upon a substantive consideration of whether the foreign policy steps taken by the Commonwealth were reasonable would involve this Court in directly examining the merits of Australian foreign policy. For reasons already given, such a duty cannot be countenanced. The duty propounded in the proposed pleading is in a different category. It seeks to avoid the difficulties inherent in pursuing a remedy which requires this Court to pass on the adequacy or otherwise of Australian foreign policy. Instead, it contends only that the Commonwealth owed Mr Habib a duty to consider whether to intercede with the foreign States on his behalf. It is apparent that this novel duty has its origins in this Court's decision in Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2006) 156 FCR 574. In that case Tamberlin J refused to strike out a judicial review action brought by a Guantanamo Bay detainee against the Attorney-General. He sought to review the Commonwealth's decision not to intervene on his behalf with the US to seek his release. He did so on the basis that the Commonwealth had taken into account certain irrelevant considerations. Tamberlin J refused to strike the case out. The duty pleaded in the proposed pleading arguably does not fall foul of the difficulty outlined in Re Ditfort . To hold that the Commonwealth should have considered whether to intercede on Mr Habib's behalf does not, arguably, involve an impermissible examination of the merits or otherwise of foreign policy. However, Mr Hicks' and Mr Habib's cases are conceptually very different. Mr Hicks sought judicial review of a decision and habeas corpus. Mr Habib seeks damages in tort. Inherent in the claim in tort is much more than Mr Hicks' claim to have the Commonwealth reconsider its position. It is a claim of wrongful conduct causing damage. It must necessarily travel further than a mere claim for reconsideration which claim Hicks v Ruddock holds to be arguable and into territory which requires the Court to reach a conclusion on what the outcome of that reconsideration should have been. Indeed, as Lord Steyn explained at 1101 [113] in Kuwait Airways , the doctrine rests, in part, on the absence of available standards by which to judge the actions of the foreign state involved. Where the potential allegation is that the US and Egypt have committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions a clear standard is available: cf. Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574 at 584-585 [21] - [23] per Tamberlin J where the potential interaction between the act of State doctrine and the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions was examined. For those reasons, I do not think it can be said that the doctrine prevents a misfeasance suit potentially going forward. Indeed, on one view of things, it may well lie in the heart of the exceptions. Conclusion"
referred to,Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378,"The Registrar noted the definition of authorisation in s 251B of the NT Act. He correctly identified that he was required to be satisfied of the matters set out in s 190C(4)(b). He also identified the nature of that task as described in Doepel at [78]. As he said, the NT Act places fundamental importance upon ensuring that claimant applications are properly authorised: see e.g. Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378. The Registrar said that the necessary statements for s 190C(5)(a) are made in the s 62 affidavits. There are affidavits pursuant to s 62 of the NT Act of May Stevens, Thomas Edward Petherick and Captain Wodidj adopting or using the words of s 62 of the NT Act, and therefore apparently providing a foundation for the Registrar's satisfaction that the requirement of s 190D(5)(a) of the NT Act had been met. He then said that he was satisfied that there was material at Schedule R and in Attachments R1, R2 and R3 to the Town of Batchelor No 2 application which met the requirements of s 190C(5)(b) as that material briefly set out the grounds on which he should consider that the requirements of s 190C(4)(b) had been met."
referred to,Re Campbell and Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 455,"Mr Rice referred ([2005] AATA 474 at [24]) to an earlier decision of the Tribunal in Re Collier and Repatriation Commission [2004] AATA 111 at [12] which had said that factor 5(b) was confusing and 'just does not make sense'. And, in Re Campbell and Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 455 at [71] a senior member said that the language was unclear and devoid of meaning. He disagreed with the decision in Re Schubinski and Repatriation Commission [2005] AATA 1273 at [100] , where a differently constituted Tribunal had said of the current factor 5(b) that the relevant words were capable of a sensible construction and that they: '... connote an element of an inability on the part of the person concerned to decrease his or her average consumption below the average stated. In other words, we hold subclause (b) to mean that an applicant must establish that for a continuous period of at least six months immediately before the clinical onset of hypertension the applicant was not only consuming an average of 300 grams per week of alcohol but was unable to consume less than that average during that period. In other words ... the relevant words in effect refer to a compulsion to drink, not merely to the fact of drinking.'"
applied,"Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437","In relation to the fifth ground, his Honour found that the Tribunal had taken into account the relevant factors and correctly applied the test in Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 ("" Randhawa ""). 20 In addressing the final ground, the Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had considered the materials presented to it by the appellant. His Honour regarded the appellant's claim that his feeling about the farm had been ignored as an attempt to challenge the factual findings, and found that the Tribunal had considered this aspect of the evidence. His Honour dismissed the application. 21 The notice of appeal filed 30 October 2006 identified the following three grounds of appeal: 1. His Honour erred as the Tribunal failed to take into all relevant material including United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (""UNHCR"") reports on internal relocation in Colombia; 2. His Honour erred at [40] because the principles of the Convention of the Rights of the Child have been incorporated into Australia law through case law; 3. His Honour erred in finding that the Tribunal did consider the situation in Colombia as only one extract of country information it relied on related to internal relocation. 22 Before the first hearing date of 5 March 2007, the appellant filed written submissions attaching a proposed amended notice of appeal identifying one ground. That ground was: ""The Federal Magistrate erred in his finding at [46] that the Tribunal correctly applied the test in Randhawa that it was reasonable for the applicants to relocate within Colombia PARTICULARS a. The Tribunal failed, or failed adequately to determine whether an appropriate level of protection existed in any other part of Colombia. b. Lead Tribunal failed to have regard, or failed to have appropriate regard to the applicants' personal circumstances and the practical realities in the event of such relocation"" 23 I will refer to this as the Randhawa ground. The Minister's had also filed written submissions in relation to the proposed amended notice of appeal. However the hearing was adjourned to allow the appellant to file and serve a proposed further amended notice of appeal raising a further ground and any evidence in support, and for both parties to provide submissions. Counsel for the appellant indicated that the further ground concerned the Tribunal's failure to access a document published by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees dated September 2002. Counsel for the Minister indicated that an amendment to raise the new ground would be opposed. Counsel for the appellant also made oral submissions on the Randhawa ground. 24 After the first hearing, the appellant served on the Tribunal a notice to admit facts. The notice required the Tribunal to admit, for the purpose of these proceedings, that on 4 December 2005, being the day before the Tribunal decision was made, the Tribunal held a document entitled ""'International protection considerations regarding Columbian asylum seekers and refugees"" from the UNHCR, Geneva, September 2002 and later revised in September 2005. The appellant also served on the Tribunal a notice to produce dated 6 March 2007, requiring the Tribunal to produce a catalogue of all the material held by the Tribunal relating to Colombia. 25 The Tribunal responded in a letter dated 20 March 2007 from its solicitors. It stated that the notice to produce was defective because it required production before the day of the final hearing, contrary to O 33 Rule 12 of the Federal Court Rules . It stated also that, in any event, the catalogue sought was not relevant to any issue in dispute, and that the Tribunal did not hold any such document. It enclosed a notice to dispute facts, by which the Tribunal disputed that it held the held the document identified in the notice to admit facts. It admitted that it held the following two documents: 1. A document entitled ""International protection considerations regarding Colombian asylum-seekers and refugees"", UNHCR, Geneva, September 2002 (""the 2002 document""); 2. A document entitled ""International protection considerations regarding Colombian asylum-seekers and refugees"", UNHCR, Geneva, March 2005 (""the 2005 document""). 29 The proposed further amended notice of appeal contained two grounds. The first was the Randhawa ground. The second ground was that the decision of the Tribunal was void for jurisdictional error by reason of unreasonableness and constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. This ground was not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court. The claim in substance is that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by failing to have regard to particular country information relevant to the question of the reasonableness of relocation in Colombia. That information was the 2002 document and the 2005 document. The appellants contended that those documents were ""readily available"" to the presiding member of the Tribunal and were ""centrally relevant"" to the decision to be made. The Tribunal's failure to obtain and have regard to the documents was said to have had the result that the Tribunal exercised its power in an unreasonable manner and constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction according to law. 30 In opposing the grant of leave to file the further amended notice of appeal, the Minister relied on the lack of a reasonable prospect of success of the ground, the lack of an acceptable explanation as to why it had not been raised below, and prejudice if the amendment was allowed. 31 The 2002 document and the 2005 document were annexed to an affidavit of the appellant's solicitor, Michaela Byers, sworn 16 April 2007. The Minister did not oppose the affidavit and annexures being admitted into evidence for the purpose of determining the application for leave to amend. However, if leave was granted, the Minister opposed the admission of the affidavit into evidence on the ground that the appellant has failed to satisfy the requirements for adducing further evidence on appeal. In particular, it was submitted that no explanation had been provided as to why the fresh evidence could not, with reasonable diligence, have been adduced at first instance. 41 I turn now to consider the Randhawa ground. While it received only limited attention by counsel for the parties, particular (b) to that ground appears to me to be of some importance. In Randhawa, the Full Court considered the appropriate test to be applied regarding the question of whether an applicant can be reasonably expected to relocate to another area in their country of nationality. The relevant principles established by the Full Court in that case appear in the judgment of Black CJ at 442-443: ""This further question, [whether the appellant could reasonably be expected to relocate to another area] is an important one because notwithstanding that real protection from persecution may be available elsewhere within the country of nationality, a person's fear of persecution in relation to that country will remain well-founded with respect to the country as a whole if, as a practical matter, the part of the country in which protection is available is not reasonably accessible to that person . In the context of refugee law, the practical realities facing a person who claims to be a refugee must be carefully considered . Moreover, the range of the realities that may need to be considered on the issue of the reasonableness of relocation extends beyond physical or financial barriers preventing an application for refugee status from reaching safety within the country of nationality and easily extends to circumstances such as those present in R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal Ex parte Jonah [1985] Imm. A.R .7. Professor Hathaway, op. cit. at 34, expresses the position thus: ""[The internal protection principle] should be restricted in its application for persons who can genuinely access domestic protection, and for whom the reality of protection is meaningful. In situations where, for example, financial, logistical, or other barriers prevent the claimant from reaching internal safety; where the quality of internal protection fails to meet basic norms of civil, political, and socio-economic human rights; or where internal safety is otherwise illusory or unpredictable, state accountability for the harm is established and refugee status is appropriately recognised."" [Emphasis in original text] If it is not reasonable in the circumstances to expect a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution in relation to the part of a country from which he or she has fled to relocate to another part of the country of nationality it may be said that, in the relevant sense, the person's fear of persecution in relation to that country as a whole is well-founded... ...Once the question of relocation had been raised for the delegate's consideration she was of course obliged to give that aspect of the matter proper consideration... In the present case the applicant raised several issues, all of which were dealt with by the decision-maker. If the appellant had raised other impediments to relocation the decision-maker would have needed to consider..."" 42 The observations of Black CJ in Randhawa (with whom Whitlam J agreed), reinforced by those of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 at [19] , establish that an applicant must establish that he or she cannot reasonably be expected to relocate to another area of their country of nationality. Yet the difficulties faced by an applicant in demonstrating that there is no other area to which they can reasonably be expected to relocate are often formidable. There are at least two main sources of difficulty. Firstly, the issue of relocation is almost always raised by the Tribunal, not the applicant, and raised at the hearing. The significance of this is particularly acute in cases where the applicant is not represented before the Tribunal, although that is not the present case. Secondly, the issue is necessarily speculative. This second issue raises the importance of the Tribunal properly evaluating what the asylum seeker says about relocating. This issue requires consideration of not only whether a safe haven exists in another part of the country. Proper consideration must also be given to the issue of relocation as a practical matter, by considering whether it would be reasonable to expect the person to relocate in view of all the ""practical realities"" facing that person. 52 On one view, the Tribunal's conclusion that it ""did not accept the [appellant's] claim in this regard"" was no more than a finding of fact. That was the approach of the Federal Magistrate. But in substance, it was significantly more. It was not a finding about past events but a conclusion that it would be reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate within Colombia without given any real consideration to the specific issue he had raised. An assessment of whether it was reasonable in the circumstances to expect the appellant to relocate could not be made by merely pointing to the fact that the appellant had not been on the farm for some years because he is in Australia and had not been doing farm work whilst in Australia. The test propounded by Black CJ in Randhawa requires that the evaluation be proper, realistic and fair and all the circumstances be taken into account. In my opinion, the Tribunal misunderstood the content of the principle propounded in Randhawa , did not apply it and thereby fell into jurisdictional error. 53 The appeal should be allowed with costs, the Tribunal's decision set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal.

applied,Mulcahy v Hydro-Electric Commission (1998) 85 FCR 170 at 212-213,"In Martin v Tasmania Development and Resources (1999) 163 ALR 79, Mr Martin claimed that a letter stating that his termination was necessary on the basis of ""operational requirements"" was misleading and deceptive and contravened s 52. At the trial of the action I found that there were in fact ""operational requirements"" within the meaning of that term in the contract of employment: 163 ALR at [55]-[67]. Mr Martin succeeded on other grounds, not relevant for present purposes. However, I held that if the representations as to operational requirements were misleading and deceptive, they would not have been made in trade or commerce. In expressing disagreement with Wilcox J, I said (at [77]): ""The majority in (Concrete Constructions) clearly rejected the wider construction of 'in trade or commerce', which would extend to virtually any activity of a corporation. It is true that a building company could not earn income unless it had workers who received instructions from foremen. But that was not enough to bring the alleged misrepresentation within the concept of 'trade or commerce'. Similarly, TDR could not carry out its activities of promoting Tasmanian trade and development (which activities themselves I assume for present purposes to be in trade or commerce) unless it engaged staff. Nevertheless such engagements and the necessary associated incidental negotiations, however necessary, are not in themselves of a trading or commercial nature. They are internal affairs of TDR."" In Mulcahy v Hydro-Electric Commission (1998) 85 FCR 170 at 212-213, another final hearing, a case concerning alleged misrepresentations by an employer to employees about superannuation entitlements, I took the same view."
cited,Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Wardley [1980] HCA 8 ; (1980) 142 CLR 237 at 260,"The applicants relied on Dao v Australian Postal Commission [1987] HCA 13 ; (1987) 162 CLR 317. Section 42(1) of the Postal Services Act 1975 (Cth) gave the Commission power to appoint persons as officers for the purposes of the Act. Section 42(2) provided that a person should not be appointed unless the Commission was satisfied, after the person had undergone a medical examination required by the Commission, as to his health and physical fitness and that he possessed such educational qualifications, or met such other requirements (if any) as were required by the Commission. The Commission dismissed Ms Dao and the other appellant from temporary employment, and refused them permanent employment, because in their medical examinations they failed to attain a specified minimum body weight determined by reference to their height and sex according to a scale prepared and used by the Commonwealth Department of Health. The Commission determined on this basis that they did not possess the standard of physical fitness required. The appellants complained before the New South Wales Equal Opportunity Tribunal that they had been discriminated against on the ground of their sex, contrary to s 25(1) of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW). The High Court held that the ss 25 and 113 of the State Act (which empowered the Tribunal to award damages and reinstatement) would result in ""a clear usurpation ... of the responsibility resting on the Commission under the Commonwealth Act"" and were ""clearly in collision with s 42 ... and must therefore, by force of s 109 of the Constitution , give way."" (at 335). Their Honours cited the statement of Mason J in Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Wardley [1980] HCA 8 ; (1980) 142 CLR 237 at 260: ""If, according to the true construction of the Commonwealth law, the right is absolute, then inevitably follows that the right is intended to prevail to the exclusion of any other law. A State law which takes away the right is inconsistent because it is in conflict with the absolute right and because the Commonwealth law relevantly occupies the field. So also with a Commonwealth law that grants a permission by way of positive authority. The Commonwealth legislative intention which sustains the conclusion that the permission is granted by way of positive authority also sustains the conclusion that the positive authority was to take effect to the exclusion of any other law. Again it produces inconsistency on both grounds: cf. Airlines of New South Wales Pty. Ltd. v. New South Wales [1965] HCA 3 ; (1965) 113 CLR 54, where the permission for which Commonwealth law provided was neither absolute nor comprehensive. (at p260)."" 99 If the present case were concerned with a complaint under the Anti-Discrimination Act about the discharge of a cadet under reg 14 (2) (a), (b) or (c) it might be said that there was a direct collision between State and Commonwealth law of the kind that occurred in Dao . However, Ms Campbell's case is not directed at any exercise of the power of discharge. It does not trespass on that confined area of Commonwealth statutory power. By stipulating the grounds on which, and the procedure by which, cadets may be discharged the Commonwealth did not evince an intention to exclude generally the operation of a Tasmanian law outlawing discriminatory conduct in the areas of activity specified in s 22(1) , and particularly education and training; cf the discussion of Wardley in Dao at 336. 100 In any case, it is difficult to see how Ms Campbell's complaint on her own behalf is affected by any provision of the Air Force Act or the Cadet Forces Regulations ."
referred to,Re Wilson and Minister for Territories (1985) 7 ALD 225,"As to the notion of serious hardship above addressed in Filsell , the Tribunal below drew attention to Re Wilson and Minister for Territories (1985) 7 ALD 225, where Deputy President Hall discussed (at 229) the meaning of the similar notion of undue hardship, in the context of exercise of the statutory discretion of the Minister to discharge a liability for payment of rates on the ground of undue hardship, being a meaning said by Deputy President Hall to connote something more severe than substantial hardship . The Tribunal below also discussed Deputy President Hall's view that undue hardship means 'hardship that is excessive in the circumstances', and that 'foreseeability and control' constitute 'relevant considerations' to the determination of hardship . Understandably Deputy President Hall further observed that neither expression undue hardship nor substantial hardship is susceptible to 'precise quantification' . The rationalisation of authorities undertaken in Re Wilson has provided assistance to later administrative decisions concerning this and analogous legislative provisions. 22 As to the factor of fairness to other taxpayers identified in Re Wilson , being a factor which I would acknowledge to be relevant to the Tribunal's approach in principle to decision-making, the Tribunal recorded also that Mr Milne had earned a high level of income in the past, and was 'still earning income in a higher bracket'. Moreover the Tribunal found that Mr Milne had been '... able to acquire assets and to live reasonably well throughout his adverse business fortunes' , though the notions of high and higher are of course relative concepts, and need to be applied with care having regard to all conceivably relevant circumstances. In any event the Tribunal accepted in favour of the Commissioner the proposition that '... releasing Mr Milne would not be fair in the absence of special factors' , consistently with the previous Tribunal decisions of Ferguson and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 779 and Spicer and Commissioner of Taxation [2002] AATA 960 , the Tribunal exemplifying Ferguson as a case involving insufficient hardship for the availability of taxation relief. In the present case moreover, the Tribunal emphasised as a so-called 'special factor' in favour of Mr Milne for the grant of serious hardship relief his 'battle to continue work despite his very poor health and the need to support his dependant son until he finishes his schooling and obtains his HSC' . 54 In reaching that conclusion, I have been unable to accept that the Tribunal was bound to adopt and implement the approach to administrative review advocated by the Commissioner, inclusively by way of appraisal of any comparison of the value of Mr Milne's assets with the amount of his liabilities at any relevant point of time, having regard to the reality of the extent of the financial hardship which would be likely to attend an exaction of the amount required to satisfy Mr Milne's outstanding taxation indebtedness, inclusive of accrued statutory interest changes, which, if not leaving Mr Milne 'destitute without any means of support' , would have constituted nevertheless serious hardship , in accordance with the text of the Commissioner's policy guidelines framed by TR 2440 and in the light of the approach undertaken specifically and by way of practical exemplification in Re Filsell and Re Wilson ."
cited,Visa International Service Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300,"it was submitted that Professor Garnaut's evidence was relevant to understand the mischief which the PRRTA Act was intended to remedy. Evidence of that kind was said to have been relied upon in Re Dr Ken Michael AM; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd (2002) 25 WAR 511 at [107] and Visa International Service Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300 at [665] . The evidence of the two experts was said to be informative and of assistance to the Court in coming to a conclusion whether the hedging losses are covered by the words 'in relation to' and in understanding what constitutes 'carrying on or providing the operations, facilities and other things comprising the project'. In summary it was said that Professor Garnaut's evidence demonstrates the economic and commercial reality of treating the hedge expenses as being in relation to the sale of petroleum or in carrying on the relevant operations. Against that background the evidence which it is sought to elicit from Professor Garnaut does not go to the meaning of any particular word or words in the PRRTA Act. The term 'economic rent' appears nowhere in the Act, nor does the term 'resources rent tax' save for the title to the Act. In particular, the Act does not contain any explicitly economic terms whose application to a particular case would be assisted by economic evidence. By explicitly economic terms, I mean words such as 'market' and 'competition' which appear in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). In proceedings under Pt IV of that Act the evidence of economists may be relied upon to aid in the identification of the relevant 'market' and judgments about the effects, historic or predictive, of particular conduct on competition in a market. 53 Re Michael concerned the application of statutory and Gas Access Code provisions to the determination of an access tariff for a gas pipeline. Parker J (Malcolm CJ and Anderson J agreeing) referred to some of the terms of the relevant Act and the Code as being 'in common use in that field of economics which is concerned with competition policy, or more particularly with the regulation of essential infrastructure' (at [107]). His Honour observed that these words or phrases conveyed a meaning to those familiar with the field of economics differing from that which the words themselves would suggest in ordinary everyday usage. He said (at [107]): 'As the subject matter is by nature conceptual there is no uniform, accepted and certain meaning, but there is a principle or theory, the essential tenets of which are widely understood, though there need not be uniform acceptance of them. In my view, expert evidence may relevantly and usefully inform the court as to this specialised usage, of which the court would otherwise be unaware, so that the court can determine whether the Act and Code is using particular words or phrases in their ordinary everyday usage, or in the specialised usage among those versed in this field of economics.' Importantly his Honour continued (at [107]): 'Further, the expert evidence provides an appreciation of the nature and objectives of competition policy in the field of economics, and, in particular, of the regulation of essential infrastructure, so that the policy and objectives of the Act can be discerned with a greater and more reliable appreciation of the possibilities. In addition, the potential relevance of some concepts and provisions in the Act and Code can be more readily understood.' In Visa , Tamberlin J observed in relation to Re Michael and other cases involving admissibility of expert economic evidence (at [665]): 'The emphasis in these cases is on informing and assisting the court with a view to illuminating an understanding of the terms used in relation to the issues raised.' His Honour also agreed with Lindgren J in Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No 6) (1996) 64 FCR 79, that, generally, it is not for an expert to give evidence as to the application of a legislative provision, as opposed to furnishing evidence from the viewpoint of an economist with respect to what factors can or should be taken into consideration or ignored. It is also appropriate to note his Honour's prudential observation, with which I agree, that (at [669]): 'In ruling on the admissibility of the expert evidence at an early stage of the hearing, I was conscious that there can be substantial difficulties particularly in relation to issues of relevance and appreciating the overall context against which to properly or fully consider admissibility. The general approach which I took was to err on the side of admitting evidence which was on or close to the borderline, on the basis that such evidence, if admitted, could be evaluated as to substance and weight in final submissions.' Professor Garnaut's evidence assumes that the Act is intended to tax economic rent as he explains that term. The company relies upon various extrinsic materials antedating the passage of the Act as indicative of that purpose. Assuming that purpose is made out, then Professor Garnaut offers what amounts to the inference that the overall objective of the Act is to generate revenue 'without distorting business decisions on the amount or composition of investment or production'. This identified purpose is relied upon to assist the Court to decide in the first place, whether the contentious hedging losses were 'expenses payable by [Woodside Energy] in relation to the sale' of petroleum within the meaning of s 24(a) of the PRRTA Act. Assuming that the hedging losses are properly to be called 'expenses' the question reduces to whether they are expenses 'in relation to' the sale. The words 'in relation to' and similar terms like 'in respect of' or 'in connection with' or just 'in' have been considered in many cases and many contexts. They denote a necessary connection between two subject matters which may be activities, events, persons or things. The nature and closeness or remoteness of the connection depends upon context. In Workers' Compensation Board (Qld) v Technical Products Proprietary Limited [1988] HCA 49 ; (1988) 165 CLR 642, the term 'in respect of' was said to have a wide meaning. It '... gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends' (at 653-654 per Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ). The words 'in relation to' have been described as a 'prepositional phrase' which is 'indefinite' and which, 'subject to any contrary indication derived from its context or drafting history ... requires no more than a relationship whether direct or indirect between two subject matters' O'Grady v North Queensland Company Limited [1990] HCA 16 ; (1990) 169 CLR 356 at 376 (McHugh J). The term is indefinite and will not generally apply to any relationship no matter how remote. The extent of the relationship required will depend upon the context in which the words are used Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia [2001] FCA 1549 ; (2001) 114 FCR 472 at 482 (Hill J) and authorities there cited. Two things may stand 'in relation to each other' in a variety of ways. The relationship may be spatial, temporal or causal. It may be a relationship of similarity or difference. Relationships between things in the law do not simply exist to await discovery. They are defined by the common law or by legislation and their authoritative interpreters. The criteria by which a statutory test of 'relationship' is to be applied will have to be relevant to and serve the purposes of the statute. The relationship between claimed expenses and the sale of petroleum products in s 24(a) of the PRRTA Act cannot be the subject of a bright line definition covering all cases but it must lie within the bounds of relevance to the statutory purpose. If that purpose can be explained or elucidated by reference to a recognised economic mechanism to which the Act is intended to give effect, then expert evidence about the operating principles of that mechanism can be received. Such evidence may not be material directly concerned with interpretation of provisions of the Act as is extrinsic material received pursuant to s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act . Nor can it justify any application of the Act beyond the bounds set by its language. But it may help to identify the purpose of the statute and thus inform the application of ambulatory terms in it such as 'in relation to' in s 24(a). The preceding observations do not import any concluded view about whether the assumption on which Professor Garnaut will base his evidence is made out. That will require a closer consideration of the terms of the Act and the extrinsic materials relevant to its interpretation. It is better done in the context of all the evidence, including the extrinsic materials relied upon. I am not prepared to rule Professor Garnaut's evidence inadmissible. I take it as evidence rather than as submission in that it purports to demonstrate that the economic mechanism to which the PRRTA Act is said to give effect would treat hedging losses as expenses in the way for which Woodside Energy contends. If some of his evidence trespasses into argument, I will simply treat it as such. I do not regard him as offering evidence on the ultimate issue even if that were a difficulty. Rather, it proposes that a certain treatment of hedging losses would advance the purpose of the statute viewed in the light of the economic theory which underpins it. I will therefore admit the evidence proposed to be called from Professor Garnaut. Ultimately, this is a decision about relevance. It may be that in the light of further evidence and argument his evidence will be shown to be based upon a false assumption. If that is so, then it may be that it will be rejected as irrelevant. I am not prepared to find, on the materials presently before me, that the assumption upon which he advances his evidence has been falsified. It seems to me to be at least arguably relevant and so will be admitted. The admissibility of the evidence of Professor Walker It is well established that evidence of accounting practice may be admitted in revenue cases so that the Court has the opportunity to characterise such things as receipts and payments for the purposes of the relevant statute by reference to accounting and commercial realities. That is not to say that such evidence can displace the words of the statute. Nor does it involve the expert witness in interpreting the statute. But where, as in this case, there are terms used of indefinite import such as 'in relation to', 'incurred ... in relation to' and 'made ... in carrying on ... operations', then such evidence may properly inform their application having regard to the purpose of the statute and the context in which the provision appears. In Rowe and Son Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 57 ; (1971) 124 CLR 421, Gibbs J referred to expert evidence that it was unusual to bring into the accounts of a trader, making sales on terms only, the payments received or receivable in the year in question and that to do so would not record the true position of the trading. In connection with such evidence generally he said (at 452): 'When the [ITAA] gives no directions on the point, the question when income is earned, and the method of accounting to be adopted for the purpose of ascertaining the income, depend upon business conceptions and the principles and practices of accountancy ...'. In BHP Billiton Professor Walker gave evidence as to the proper accounting treatment to be adopted in the accounts of a corporation such as BHP Billiton. The passage from the judgment of Gibbs J quoted above was quoted in the joint judgment of Hill and Heerey JJ at 134. In Ogilvy Mather Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 95 ALR 663, Hill J, in the Full Court, referred to expert evidence which had been adduced from a professor of accounting and said (at 703): 'Accounting evidence cannot be substituted for the test laid down by s 51(1): FCT v James Flood Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 65 ; (1953) 88 CLR 492 at 506-7. Nevertheless, as the Full Court of this court pointed out in Hooker Rex Pty Ltd v FCT 88 ATC 4392 at 4399: ""... the tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the concepts of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy, not only in the ascertainment of income, but also in the ascertainment of expenditure: DCT (SA) v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd [1938] HCA 69 ; (1938) 63 CLR 108 at 153; FCT v Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd (1984) 54 ALR 209; 84 ATC 4642'.' Applying the prudential approach adopted by Tamberlin J in the Visa case, to which I referred earlier, I am of the opinion that Professor Walker's evidence should be admitted as arguably relevant to the application of the terms to which I have referred and the proper characterisation of the hedging losses in the context of the provisions to which I have referred. Conclusion For the preceding reasons, the evidence of Professors Garnaut and Walker will be admitted at the hearing. I certify that the preceding sixty-four (64) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.

Similar characteristics of an arrangement under a statutory licence were described by Wilson J in The Queen v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 69 ; (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 352 as the grant of rights under a statutory scheme (in that case, grazing rights) rather than as a supply of fodder.

cited,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"Section 5(1)(b) of the ADJR Act provides that a decision may be reviewed on the ground that "" procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed"" . This ground of review has been described as 'procedural ultra vires'. It is concerned with determining the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory provision. Any distinction between directory and mandatory requirements is not relevant: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 390-391. The acts to which this ground of review is directed are usually requirements laid down by an Act to reach a decision within a certain period of time or after a period of consultation. 51 The applicant has not identified a procedure prescribed by the HREOC Act which HREOC has not observed. Instead, under this heading, the applicant asserts that HREOC failed to perform its functions under ss 11(1)(f) and 20(1) of the HREOC Act in that it failed to give proper consideration to the evidence before it. In support of that contention, the applicant referred to what he described as 10 matters of ""key evidence"" that the President of HREOC had failed to consider. The matters were said by the applicant to be: (1) the plant was non addictive; (2) the plant was non toxic; (3) there were no health warnings in relation to the plant; (4) the lack of experience and expertise in the Department; (5) the Department breached s 52E(1)(b) of the TGA in that the Department failed to take into account "" the risks and benefits associated with the use of a substance ""; (6) the Department placed the plant into Schedule 9 for reasons other than public health and safety (7) possible bias in HREOC's decision making process. At the hearing, the applicant disavowed any suggestion that HREOC was biased; (8) the NDPSC was motivated by improper purposes including "" religio-political factors"" ; (9) evidence of ""behind the scenes"" discussions. Three examples were provided. First, an internal review document provided by the TGA in which a Dr P Chipman stated that "" Customs might have expressed concern to the TGA by way of telephone calls and it is possible that telephone discussions between the two agencies may not have been filed"" . The second example provided as evidence of possible collusion or interference in the decision making process was the "" surprisingly prompt knowledge by the NDPSC ... of US Congressional Bill HR 5607 at the 15-17 October, 2002 meeting of the NDPSC, which Bill had only been introduced into Congress on the 10 th October 2002"" . The third example was an assertion by the applicant that he "" was advised by a US journalist that information pertaining to Australia's prohibition of [the plant] may have been leaked to the US Drug Enforcement Agency"" and "" [t]his may have occurred just prior to the unsuccessful US Bill HR 5607 which sought to prohibit [the plant] in that country"" ; (10) the concern expressed in the Australian Parliament by Lindsay Tanner that the TGA was unable to identify an authorative scientific source for the plant when considering whether it should be included in Sch 9 and the fact that this was not referred to by HREOC in its decision. 52 The applicant's contention that HREOC failed to perform its functions under ss 11(1)(f) and 20(1) of the HREOC Act in that it failed to give proper consideration to the matters listed in the preceding paragraph establishes no basis for review under this heading. Neither the general allegation nor any of the specific matters identified by the applicant concerns a procedure prescribed by the HREOC Act which HREOC has not observed. That is reason enough to conclude that the asserted ground is not made out."
considered,Nikolaidis v Legal Services Commissioner [2007] NSWCA 130,"It is well established that before it can be said that a representation was prepared or obtained in contemplation of a proceeding, it must be established that a proceeding was ""likely"" or ""reasonably probable"": see Nikolaidis v Legal Services Commissioner [2007] NSWCA 130 at [61] and the cases there mentioned. The two questions which need to be determined for present purposes are, first, can it be said that legal proceedings were in contemplation and, second, if so, were they in the contemplation of the person or persons who prepared or obtained the relevant representations? For present purposes I am satisfied that representations contained in the documents which indicate that there were products purchased from retailers which did not contain AMC's insert in the packaging (ie products which were parallel imports) are at least presently relevant representations. As to the question whether legal proceedings were in contemplation at that time between AMC and Hamilton, I am not satisfied on the material before me such was the case. As I indicated above, the evidence does not suggest there was a likelihood or reasonable probability of legal proceedings at the relevant time. While the relationship of the parties at this time was undoubtedly tense, they had by then been in a long term relationship spanning 14 years. Such references as were made in correspondence to Hamilton's alleged responsibility to compensate AMC either for Dr Lam's success fee or for loss sustained by AMC from parallel importing could at best only be properly treated as reflecting a negotiating process between the parties at this stage. 12 When one turns to the contemplation of legal proceedings in Hong Kong, the situation is quite different. It is clear that from August 2002, as the investigation into parallel importing appeared to bear fruit in AMC's eyes, the prospect of taking proceedings against distributors and retailers was a very real one. Notwithstanding that AMC obviously was wishing to resolve disputes without resort to legal proceedings and the correspondence reflects this it also makes it perfectly plain that litigation was contemplated. It suggests that, by early September, proceedings were pending and on the evidence before me a writ had been issued by mid-October which, coincidentally, was the time at which the last group of documents in the bundle were referrable. For this reason I am prepared to infer that so far as Dr Keung and Dr Lam were concerned, legal proceedings throughout the time period covered by the business records in question were likely or reasonably probable against Hong Kong distributors and/or retailers involved in alleged parallel importing."
referred to,Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Limited [2009] FCAFC 137,"writing these reasons, I note that the Full Court of this Court held in Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Limited [2009] FCAFC 137 that a failure by the Tribunal to comply with s 43(2) of the AAT Act is an error of law. However, the Court also held that a failure to comply with s 43(2) did not inevitably lead to an order setting aside the decision. Whether the decision is set aside will depend on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 44(5) of the AAT Act."
cited,Mann v O'Neill [1997] HCA 28 ; (1997) 191 CLR 204,"The applicant should understand that the kinds of complaints she makes about the judges of this Court must be viewed in the light of the immunity which attaches to judicial proceedings. A judge, a jury, the parties, their representatives and witnesses enjoy an absolute privilege in respect of their statements in judicial proceedings: Cabassi v Villa [1940] HCA 41 ; (1940) 64 CLR 130 at 140; Mann v O'Neill [1997] HCA 28 ; (1997) 191 CLR 204 at 211. The rationale for the rule is that it is indispensable for the performance of the function: Mann v O'Neill 191 CLR at 213. It exists for the protection of judicial independence: Fingleton v R [2005] HCA 34 ; (2005) 216 ALR 474 at 486. No action lies against a judge in defamation for the matters published in the judge's reasons."
cited,Stockdale v Alesios [1999] VSCA 128 ; [1999] 3 VR 169,"4 of the notice of appeal focused on the way in which the Federal Magistrates Court had dealt with the appellant's attempt to make further submissions after the hearing of the appeal by that court. The federal magistrate dealt with this attempt in an addendum to her Honour's reasons for judgment. At [94]-[95], her Honour said: After the conclusion of the hearing, the applicant sent to my associate two emails which purported to be post hearing submissions. It did not come to my attention for some weeks that the applicant had purported to file post hearing submissions. When I learned of them, I asked my associate to email the applicant, advising him that post hearing submissions could not be received by the court without leave. I did not at that stage read the purported post hearing submissions. The applicant eventually decided to file an application seeking leave to rely on the purported post hearing submissions. The respondent filed material in response to that application, which was heard on 12 August 2008. The applicant explained to the court in an affidavit that he had not put forward at the hearing the matters contained in his purported post hearing submissions because it was a long day and he was tired, particularly because of his age and a hearing problem. He also said that the submissions merely highlighted aspects of the evidence, which the court should have been aware of in any event. At [96]-[97], her Honour cited Carr v Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd [No 1] [1981] HCA 20 ; (1981) 147 CLR 246 at 257-258 per Mason J and Stockdale v Alesios [1999] VSCA 128 ; [1999] 3 VR 169. Both these cases are authority for the proposition that a court cannot receive further submissions after a hearing without granting leave for such submissions. In the latter case at 179, Phillips JA spoke of certain exceptions to that general principle, ""such as an unexpected change in the position of the parties which bears upon the disposition of the appeal or the discovery after argument concludes of relevant legislation or some further decision of authority to which the court should be referred."""
cited,Elliott v Nanda and Another [2001] FCA 418 ; (2001) 111 FCR 240,"Under s 105 of the SDA a person who causes, instructs, aids or permits another person to do an act that is unlawful under Division 1 or 2 of Part II shall, for the purposes of the SDA, be taken also to have done the act. The meaning of the word 'permit' was discussed in Cooper v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Another [1999] FCA 180 ; (1999) 93 FCR 481 at 494-495, [41] - [45] . Moore J in Elliott v Nanda and Another [2001] FCA 418 ; (2001) 111 FCR 240 at 293, [163] explained the operation of s 105 as pertaining to the situation where a person who is in a position to prevent allegedly unlawful conduct fails to do so. His Honour said: 'Section 105 provides a means of bringing about lawful conduct by rendering liable a person who could prevent unlawful conduct from occurring or continuing or who assists, directly or indirectly, in its performance. A person can prevent unlawful conduct by not creating a situation where it will or may take place or altering a situation so it will not continue.'"
followed,"Fuduche v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1993) 45 FCR 515","relation to the medical evidence, the Federal Magistrate observed that: ""the Tribunal was not disbelieving of the Applicant's medical practitioner. The Tribunal was rather saying that whatever illness the Applicant might have been suffering from had not been observed by it to prevent the Applicant giving his evidence"" , and said that this was not an error such as was found in Fuduche v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1993) 45 FCR 515. Furthermore, the Federal Magistrate noted that the selection and assessment of independent country information was a matter for the Tribunal. The Federal Magistrate rejected the submission that the Tribunal had required independent corroboration regarding the appellant's claims about his conversion to Christianity and his asserted dissipation of funds after the purported withdrawal of financial support by the Islamic group and was of the opinion that the Tribunal's finding that it was not readily believable that the appellant's financial resources had all disappeared, was unobjectionable and accorded with the facts as they stood. The second aspect of this submission was that the Tribunal had deprived itself of jurisdiction by imposing a requirement on the appellant that he be formally baptised in order to be at risk of persecution as an apostate from Islam. The Federal Magistrate observed that: ""...the Tribunal did not at any stage in its reasons for decision assert that it was necessary for the Applicant to have provided independent evidence of his conversion to Christianity or that baptism was necessary for persecution to occur."" As to the claim of bias, the Federal Magistrate read the transcript and listened to the audio recording of the hearing. The Federal Magistrate said that the transcript did not show on its face either unfairness to the appellant or a predisposition amounting to a mind not open to argument and that the audio recording did not show any overt hostility on the part of the Tribunal. The Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the Tribunal member was listening attentively to the appellant and that the appellant's answers were coherent, to the point and showed no undue signs of stress with the exception of the last paragraph of his evidence which did suggest ""a certain weariness and distress"" on the part of the appellant. The Federal Magistrate found that the transcript and the audio recording did not reveal any improper conduct and that even if he accepted that the Tribunal member had turned her back on the appellant (and he made no such finding) that conduct was at worst an unfortunate discourtesy but did not give rise to a finding of bias."
cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam and Another [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222,"If the Court is satisfied that the ABA has misdirected itself in law or has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider, or taken irrelevant matters into consideration, its decision will have miscarried: see Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 (at 118-119 per Gibbs J). However, the failure of a decision maker to take into account an insignificant matter may not warrant a Court setting aside the decision: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Anor v Peko-Wallsend Limited and Ors at 40. If the Court should conclude that there is inadequate factual material to support a finding by the ABA, it could lead to the inference that the Tribunal has applied a wrong test or has not otherwise satisfied the requisite matters which it was obliged to consider under s 84(2) of the Act: see The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board and Another: Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Company Proprietary Limited [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 120. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam and Another [2002] HCA 32 ; [2002] 210 CLR 222, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said at page 241: 'Whether a decision would or would not have been made without a particular factual finding depends on indications to that effect in the decision, the reasons for decision or the decision making process. And unless it is possible to say on a proper analysis of the decision, the reasons for decision or the decision making process that, had a particular finding not been made, the decision in question would not have been reached, it is, in our view, impossible to say that the decision was based on that finding.'"
referred to,Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] HCA 1335,"An order for limited discovery is, or is becoming, the more usual order made by this Court. In the case of such an order, cases such as Telstra Corp and Gray suggest the rule of practice referred to in GE Capital does not apply because the nature of the order (that is, discovery by classes or categories of documents identified in the order) is such that the party giving discovery does not have to consider questions of relevance to an issue. Had I made such an order in this case, I would have been disposed to follow those cases. Perhaps, as Sundberg J observed in Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1335 (at [26]), in practical terms the difference between the two approaches will not often be of great significance. In this case it does make a difference because the respondent did not seek to justify the masking of the documents beyond its reliance on the oath of discovery and, although in some cases ( GE Capital is an example) the Court is able to say from its own examination of the masked documents that there are no grounds to think the masked portions are relevant, I am not satisfied that, if I had to address the question, I could reach that conclusion in this case."

referred to,Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 3) (2006) 230 ALR 528,"On 29 December 2005, 4 January 2006 and on 19 January 2006 APRA filed notices of motion and statements of charge seeking orders that Mr Siminton be punished for contempt in respect of nine alleged breaches of the orders made by Sundberg J. On 30 March 2006 Merkel J found six of those charges proven. He described them collectively as ""the disposal contempts"". In sentencing Mr Siminton for these contempts Merkel J summarised Mr Siminton's conduct as follows: ""On the evidence before the court, it is clear that Siminton's disposal contempts were of an extremely serious kind and constituted wilful disobedience and contumacious disregard of the court's orders. The seriousness of the breaches is underlined by the fact that Siminton's conduct was precisely the kind of conduct against which Sundberg J sought to guard by the making of the orders the subject of the contempt charges. The conduct involved the actual transfer of large sums of money ($536,880.18, $38,000, $43,000, $5,000 and $10,000 respectively), and an attempted cash withdrawal from a Bendigo Bank account of $500,000, all of which occurred shortly after Siminton became aware of the Sundberg J orders."" See: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 3) (2006) 230 ALR 528 at 529. On 10 April 2006 Merkel J ordered that Mr Siminton be imprisoned for a period of 10 weeks in respect of the disposal contempts. 3 Mr Siminton lodged an appeal against the findings and orders made by Merkel J. On 19 July 2006 a Full Court allowed the appeal in part, setting aside the order for imprisonment and imposing, in lieu, a fine of $50,000. Paragraph two of the Full Court's order read: ""2. Paragraph 2 of the orders of Merkel J made on 10 April 2006 is set aside and in lieu thereof it is ordered: (a) A fine in the sum of $50,000 be imposed on the appellant in respect of the contempt the subject of charges 1.1 and 1.2 of the statement of charge dated 4 January 2006 and charges 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 of the statement of charge dated 19 January 2006. (b) The fine be paid to the District Registrar within 60 days or such further time and by such instalments as the District Registrar may allow. (c) In the event that there is default in payment of the fine or of any instalment, the District Registrar shall apply to a judge of the Court for direction concerning enforcement."" Mr Siminton was present in Court when the order was pronounced. 4 On 18 September 2006, the day which the 60 day period prescribed by Order 2(b) expired, Mr Siminton applied for an extension of time within which to make payment of the $50,000. The application was supported by an affidavit, sworn on 14 September 2006, by the solicitor acting for Mr Siminton. The solicitor deposed: ""5. I am advised by my client and verily believe that he is presently unable to pay the said fine. On 10 January 2006 Gray J made an interlocutory order in the principal matter inter alia totally freezing all of my client's funds and assets. As a consequence of the full order of Gray J, which addresses a number of aspects, many hundreds of thousands of dollars have been frozen. As part of the proposed Application to stay and or set aside the principal application, a consequential application will be made to stay and/or set aside the said order of Gray J. In the circumstances, it is respectfully submitted that my client's ability to pay the fine or otherwise should not be determined whilst he is subject to such freezing order and since a challenge is to be mounted as aforesaid to such order that there be a stay for the payment of the fine pending the hearing and determination of such challenge."" By order dated 18 September 2006 the District Registrar extended the time for payment to 5:00 pm on 2 October 2006. On that day Mr Siminton's solicitors wrote to the District Registrar seeking a further extension of one month for Mr Siminton to pay the fine. No reason for seeking the extension was given. The application was refused. The fine has not since been paid. 5 On 3 October 2006, in accordance with paragraph 2 (c) of the order of the Full Court, the District Registrar applied for direction concerning enforcement of its order."
cited,Miller v University of New South Wales [2003] FCAFC 180,"is clear that superior courts of justice, including the Federal Court of Australia, have the power to control and supervise proceedings brought within their jurisdiction, including the power to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process (cf Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Mason CJ at 25, 28, Deane J at 58, Gaudron J at 74, 76; Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 518 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ; Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529 at 536; Miller v University of New South Wales [2003] FCAFC 180 at [77-81] ; and note the consideration of this issue by the majority of the High Court in Batistatos v Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [5-8] and by Kirby J at [121-128])."
followed,Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699,"In Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [43], Finkelstein J pointed out that the section does not confer substantive obligations. His Honour said: 43. ...I do not accept that the power conferred by s 601EE(2) is without restriction. In particular, I do not accept that the section permits the court to impose an otherwise nonexistent obligation on a person to provide information to a receiver appointed to wind up a managed investment scheme. It is a well established principle of statutory construction that, in the absence of clearly expressed language to the contrary, courts will presume that legislation is intended to leave individual rights intact. 15 Section 601EE(2) does not confer on this Court the power to impose a legally enforceable obligation to pay the remuneration and costs of a liquidator on persons who previously bore no such obligation. Once that truism is accepted, the form of the 2002 variation to the 2001 Order is perfectly understandable. After the Tasmanian Parliament had enacted s 108(2)(a)(iii) of the Legal Profession Act 1993 , it would have been confusing and misleading to leave the 2001 Order in its existing form. Viewed objectively in the light of the surrounding circumstances, the purpose of the variation was to make the Order show what the source of the Liquidator's remuneration was now to be, given the recent enactment of s 108(2)(a)(iii). 16 Subsequent variations to the 2001 Order in 2007 and 2008 do not affect this conclusion. The variation in 2007 simply provided procedures for detailing expenses which consisted of legal fees. It also provided a further avenue for review by the Court, additional to those contained in par 2(c)(i) and (ii) of the 2001 Order (which provided, in general terms, for ASIC, Piggott Wood &amp; Baker, any investor in the scheme, or the Liquidator to apply to the Court for directions). The 2007 provision, par 2(c)(iii), for the Court's review is specifically directed to the District Registrar's review of the Liquidator's claim for costs and remuneration."
cited,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Truhold Benefit Pty. Ltd. [1985] HCA 36 ; (1985) 158 CLR 678,"There is also good reason not to imply any such intention. In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Brown [1958] HCA 2 ; (1957-1958) 100 CLR 32 , at 40-41 Dixon CJ noted, albeit as he acknowledged without at the time a judicial decision to that effect, that it was generally assumed that "" under the Constitution liability for tax could not be imposed upon a subject without leaving open to him some judicial process by which he could show that he was not taxable or not taxable in the sum assessed "". As Dawson J later noted in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1994-1995) 183 CLR 168 , at 222, the general assumption to which Sir Owen Dixon referred did receive later judicial recognition: (His Honour referred to MacCormick v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1984] HCA 20 ; (1984) 158 CLR 622 ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Truhold Benefit Pty. Ltd. [1985] HCA 36 ; (1985) 158 CLR 678 at 684 ; Air Caledonie International v The Commonwealth [1988] HCA 61 ; (1988) 165 CLR 462 at 467). Section 14ZZN of the TAA therefore serves the important constitutional end of expressly providing for recourse by the person affected to the judicial power of the Commonwealth for a challenge to an administratively assessed taxation liability. Section 15A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) counsels that Acts should be read and construed subject to the Constitution and so as not to exceed Commonwealth legislative power. Section 14ZZN provides for a fixed time limit within which to engage this constitutionally necessary right of challenge. In the face of language that did not expressly forbid the practice and whose language was broad enough on its face to permit it, it would be a strong thing to discern by implication a prohibition as to joinder which would foreclose by a technicality of form such an important and necessary right."

In this case, it is clear that the decision of the Tribunal, which reviewed and affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate to cancel the applicant's visa under the Migration Act , was also a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision. Accordingly, an appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal concerning such a decision does not lie within s 44 AAT Act , and is not competent (cf Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 and Boyes v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 505)."

followed,Collins Debden Pty Ltd v Cumberland Stationery Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1194,"The Evidence Act applies to this proceeding; see s 4(1). Order 33 rule 11(5) of the Rules of Court extends the operation of ss 118 and 119 of the Evidence Act to orders for the production of documents in circumstances where the call for production is made in the course of evidence being adduced before the Court; see Collins Debden Pty Ltd v Cumberland Stationery Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1194 at [6] , per Lindgren J. 12 Section 118(a) of the Evidence Act , when read together with O 33 r 11(5) of the Rules of the Court, prevents the production of documents if the production would result in disclosure of a confidential communication made between the client and a lawyer, for the dominant purpose of the lawyer providing legal advice to the client. 13 The documents, the subject of the current call for production, have been described by Mr McDonald (the in-house lawyer for Forestry Tasmania) as being prepared for the purpose of communication between Dr Read and Mr Meggs, to have Mr Meggs critically review affidavits of two witnesses called by Senator Brown, as well as Dr Read's affidavit. 20 In Collins at [5] and [6], Lindgren J stated that s 119 (and inferentially s 118) of the Evidence Act applies to the stage where evidence is adduced, and not to the earlier pre-trial stage of access to documents discovered or produced on subpoena. Order 33 rule 11 applies at the stage where evidence is being adduced in conjunction with ss 118 and 119 by extending their operation. 21 Whether O 33 r 11, in conjunction with ss 118 and 119 , is a code is beside the point.

Although not necessarily to be regarded as an anomalous or illogical remedy, it is nevertheless an unusual one. In my opinion where a statute creates a remedy by way of damages for breach of a proprietary right, then absent specific provision or necessary implication, it should not be read as extending that remedy to exemplary damages. In this case a statutory formulation is used which has been construed as compensatory. It contrasts notably with the express provision in the Copyright Act for ""additional damages"". Exemplary damages are not available under s 126. 37 The applicants claim their compensatory damages under the following heads: 1. Loss of sales through eBay. 2. Loss through devaluation of their product. 3. Loss through damage to their reputations. 38 Under the heading of 'Loss of sales"" the applicants referred to the numbers of DVD titles relevant to each applicant sold by Mr Hasluck on eBay. They also referred to the number of DVDs delivered up by him relevant to each applicant. As a matter of inference, having regard to the marks on the delivered up DVDs and Mr Hasluck's acknowledgment of his infringing conduct in relation to sales over eBay, each of the DVDs sold through the eBay bearing the title belonging to a particular applicant would have borne the trade mark of that applicant."

However the obligation imposed is not coextensive with that which might be imposed by the common law to avoid practical injustice: VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; BC200301782; (ii) the word 'information' in s 424A(1) has the same meaning as in s 424: Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 ; (2001) 105 FCR 212 at 218 [20] ; and in this setting it refers to knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal: Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 ; BC200004607 at [3]; irrespective of whether it is reliable or has a sound factual basis: Win , at 217-218 [19]-[22]; and (iii) the word does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations: Tin at [54]; Paul at FCR 428 [95]; Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1679 ; BC200107472 at [25]; approved [2002] FCAFC 120 ; BC200203793; nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc: WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276 at 282-4 [26] - [29] . The Court substantially accepted this approach in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 ("" SZEEU ""): compare SZEEU at 226-228 per Moore J, at 252 and 254 per Weinberg J and at 259-260 per Allsop J. 24 Accordingly, I accept that, for present purposes, ""information"" does not encompass the Tribunal's appraisals or thought processes, although the Tribunal's appraisals and thought processes may show the relevance of the information in question and indicate what is required for compliance with s 424A(1). It follows that information is not constituted by what the Tribunal considers to be defects in evidence or a lack of evidentiary specificity. Secondly, information may have relevance for any number of reasons: compare SZEEU at 263 per Allsop J. 25 I accept that the Tribunal's knowledge of the letter was ""information"" for the purposes of s 424A(1). The contents of the letter included statements about the appellant and about the letter-writer. The information was, relevantly, the knowledge that the letter communicated to the Tribunal. 26 The Tribunal gave no weight to the statements in the letter about the appellant's psychological condition because the letter did not communicate enough about the letter-writer's qualifications. According to its reasons, the Tribunal's determination about the importance of the letter to its review was the product of its evaluation of the significance of this deficiency. As already noted, whilst the Tribunal's thought processes (including appraisals and evaluations) are not ""information"", they show why the information that they concern (here, the letter) was relevant for s 424A(1) purposes. 33 Obligations arise under s 424A(1) in respect of information that the Tribunal considers would be a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. In the present case, for the reasons already noted, the letter played a part in the Tribunal's reasons for its decision, even if only a subsidiary part. Notwithstanding that a piece of information constitutes only a minor or subsidiary part of the Tribunal's reasons, s 424A is attracted: see SZEEU at 252 per Weinberg J and at 262 per Allsop J; and NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ("" NBKT "") at [31] per Young J, with whom Gyles and Stone JJ agreed. The Tribunal considered the letter in the form it took, and put the statements about the appellant's psychological condition, which it contained, out of reckoning because the letter did not state the letter-writer's clinical qualifications. The adverse credibility finding, made after the Tribunal had put this letter out of account, was central to the Tribunal's decision. The fact that the Tribunal's reasoning did not proceed in a straight-line way is immaterial. Weinberg J explained in SZEEU at 253 that: The actual process by which a decision is reached is, of course, a complex matter. It is not always as neat as the reasons themselves may suggest. The reasoning may not proceed in a linear fashion, and the Tribunal's reasons must, of course, be read as a whole. 43 In other cases, the Tribunal has asked the applicant about such information, which it has generally found in the Department's file in the Tribunal's possession. In cases of this kind, the Court has adopted no fixed view about the application of the exception. On some occasions, it has found that s 424A(3)(b) does not apply, because the applicant was not to be taken as having given the information to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review application: see, for example, NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 744 at [39] - [42] per Jacobson J. In SZBMI , which appeal is reported with SZEEU , the applicant confirmed with the Tribunal that an earlier statement as to flight information was true and correct. This led the respondent to argue that the appellant in that case had adopted the flight information and given it to the Tribunal for the purposes of its review. Moore J, at 225, specifically rejected this submission, commenting: I do not accept that, by adopting the statement at the hearing before the Tribunal, that information was transformed into information provided by the appellant in his application for review. In my opinion, the approach of Jacobson J in NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs was correct. If the Tribunal comes to know of what was said by an applicant at a point before any application for review was made, and views what was said at that time as material to its assessment of what was later said by an applicant, then the mere adoption of the earlier statement during the review process would not result in the knowledge (and relevantly information in the present appeal) being comprehended by s 424A(3)(b). Different considerations could arise if it was clear the Tribunal treated only the adoption of the earlier statement as the fact relevant to its consideration of the application in the review. In those circumstances the fact of adoption would almost certainly constitute information provided by the applicant in the application on which the exclusion would operate. 44 Weinberg J agreed with Moore J that the adoption of the earlier statement by the appellant during the hearing before the Tribunal did not render it information provided by him in his application for review: see SZEEU at 252. Allsop J did not consider the operation of the exception in s 424A(3)(b) in this context. 45 As Young J noted in NBKT at [55], the Full Court's approach in SZEEU to issues of this kind must also take into account its treatment of a similar question in the appeal in SZDXA , also reported with SZEEU . The relevant information in SZDXA was the fact that the appellant had a temporary business visa to Australia. Moore J concluded that, although the Tribunal had acquired this information from sources other than the appellant, the Tribunal had discussed the fact with the appellant at the hearing and the appellant had affirmed that he had entered Australia on a business visa. In this circumstance, Moore J concluded, at 242, that the information fell within 424A(3)(b) and Weinberg J agreed, at 254, observing, at 255, that the adoption of an earlier statement at the hearing can bring that statement within the exception. Allsop J agreed, at 268, with Moore J in relation to SZDXA . The Full Court in NBKT reached a similar conclusion in relation to the information in question in that case: see NBKT at [60]-[63] per Young J. See also SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 at [43] per Heerey J; and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] per Kenny J."
followed,Re Tooth &amp; Co Ltd [1978] FCA 9 ; (1978) 31 FLR 314,"my view, the Court does have a discretion to refuse relief in such circumstances, even to the extent the application is brought under s 163A of the Act: see, eg, Re Tooth &amp; Co Ltd [1978] FCA 9 ; (1978) 31 FLR 314. As I have said, time for compliance has been extended. This time frame is not in dispute. Documents have been delivered by the applicants to the ACCC by reason of some or all of the Notices. The applicants did not challenge the decision to issue the Notices or the Notices before supplying those documents. Some delay occurred before the applicants brought their applications in this Court. There is no suggestion that any prosecution is intended based upon the Notices and the original time frame for compliance. These would all be reasons for refusing as a matter of discretion the substantive relief sought by the applicants. In view of the above reasons, the applications should be dismissed. I will make orders to facilitate the parties reaching an agreement as to costs. In the event that no agreement is reached, then orders will be made as to the exchange of submissions on the issue of costs. I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-three (123) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.

cited,Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35,"of those material facts, in a case in which s 45A of the TPA is relied on, is the area or areas within Australia in which particular respondents compete with each other and in which they give effect to any anti-competitive agreement to which they are parties. As Middleton J said in Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35 at 41: ""The services the subject of the unlawful provision must be the services supplied by the relevant party to the arrangement in competition with the other party in any market in Australia. Put another way, the area of competition has to coincide with the area of restriction imposed by the unlawful provision: see ss 45A(8) , 4D (1)(a) and (2) ..."". In Emirates , Middleton J referred to the issue in the course of dealing with applications to set aside notices issued under s 155 of the TPA. His Honour held (at 52): ""... the place of contracting is not determinative of the geographic locality of the relevant market. The references relied upon in Heydon J D, Trade Practices Law (Lawbook Co, subscription service) do not, in context, stand for such a proposition. As the authorities referred to previously indicate, the concept of a 'market' refers to a range of 'competitive activities' relating to the field of actual or potential activities between buyers and sellers among whom there is, or can be, close competition. It involves the 'field of rivalry', not just referrable [sic] to the place of contracting"". It had been submitted to his Honour that some observations which I had made in my previous reasons supported the proposition that there could not be a market in Australia unless contracts between buyers and sellers were negotiated and entered into in Australia. One of the respondents' grounds for seeking to have the SASC struck out was that it did not identify the various routes, to and from Australia, on which the various respondents (or some of them) competed. It was in this context that I said at [21] that: ""The respondents in the present proceeding are entitled to know where in Australia it is said that they compete with each other named respondent for the provision of international airfreight services. This will depend on where negotiations between the respondents and their customers take place and contracts are entered into. These material particulars are not provided. It cannot be assumed that all or even some of the respondents are in competition, in the necessary sense, in all parts of Australia. In the absence of these material facts the pleadings are deficient in a significant respect"". On reflection, I should have used the word ""may"" instead of ""will"" in the second sentence of the quoted passage. It was not my intention to rule, on a pleading summons, that the place or places where the international carriers negotiated and entered into contracts with those who wished to use their services, were or would be determinative of the geographic location of the relevant markets. These were relevant but not decisive considerations. If the only substantial competitive activity which occurred between particular carriers on routes into and out of Australia took place overseas this may have suggested that the relevant market was not ""in Australia"" even if contracts were signed here. On the other hand, if vigorous competition and negotiations in Australia culminated in contracts being signed overseas the opposite conclusion would be likely. These matters were, therefore, material in determining the geographic parameters of the relevant market and, in particular, whether that market was ""in Australia"". Those parameters differed between the respondent carriers, because they did not all provide services to and from the same ports or along the same routes. For present purposes, the applicant's failure to identify where relevant negotiations took place, and where contracts were entered into and signed between the respondents and their customers, does not lead to the conclusion that it has thereby also failed to plead facts which would be determinative of the geographic boundaries of the market. The failure does, however, mean that material facts which must be provided in order to identify the global market and the part of it which constitutes a ""market in Australia"" have not been supplied. In its SASC the applicant failed to plead the existence of any relevant market in Australia. It sought to remedy this deficiency, in its FASC, by pleading the existence of multiple markets, variously described. This has served only to create greater confusion. The individual respondents are entitled to know the markets for the provision of international air freight services which are alleged to exist in Australia, and in which of those markets it is alleged that they compete with another respondent or respondents and who those other respondents are. The FASC does not provide this essential information."
followed,Port of Geelong Authority v The 'Bass Reefer' (1992) 37 FCR 374,"Mr Cutler argued that the correct approach to the interpretation of s 4(3)(f) could be found in Port of Geelong Authority v The 'Bass Reefer' (1992) 37 FCR 374 at 380-82 in which case Foster J adopted the approach of Lord Keith of Kinkel in Gatoil International Inc v Arkwright-Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co [1985] AC 255 at 270-71 and said that the relationship connoted by the words ""that relates to"" in s 4(3)(f) must be ""some reasonably direct connection"". The same passage from Lord Keith's speech in Gatoil [1985] AC at 270-71 was cited with apparent approval by Gummow J in Empire Shipping Company Inc v Owners of the Ship 'Shin Kobe Maru' (1991) 32 FCR 78 at 95 (at first instance). 26 Mr Cutler submitted that the claim did not arise out of an agreement, since the claim was pleaded only in bailment and tort. He also submitted that there was an insufficiently direct connection between any relevant agreement (if there were one) out of which the claim arose and the carriage of goods by a ship to satisfy the test laid down in The 'Bass Reefer' 37 FCR 374. 35 Thus, both Gatoil and The 'Antonis P Lemos' can be seen as unanimous decisions of the final court of appeal in the United Kingdom interpreting domestic legislation having its origins in an international convention, one aim of which was to bring uniformity of approach among different legal systems. The existence of those decisions, the desirability of international uniformity, or at least broad consistency, and an expressed suggestion by the ALRC (which was heeded) that Parliament follow the wording of the 1981 UK Act, which had been (recently) interpreted (as well as the antecedent provision in the 1956 UK Act) by the House of Lords in Gatoil and The 'Antonis P Lemos' necessarily constrain the interpretation of s 4(3)(f), certainly at first instance. Further, two judges, of this Court (Foster J in The 'Bass Reefer' and Gummow J in The 'Shin Kobe Maru' ) at first instance have applied Gatoil."
referred to,Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1566,"Mr Spalla appealed against the decision of Finkelstein J to the Full Court. The Full Court, which was constituted by Heerey, Sundberg and Weinberg JJ, upheld his Honour's decision: see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1566 ("" Spalla (No 2) ""). The Full Court held, amongst other things, that the primary judge was correct to find that Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed: see Spalla (No 2) at [61]-[70]."
discussed,Kolotex Hosiery (Australia) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 5 ; (1975) 132 CLR 535 ,"Kolotex Hosiery (Australia) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 5 ; (1975) 132 CLR 535 ("" Kolotex "") was another case concerning the carry forward loss provisions. On the taxpayer's appeal to the High Court against the Commissioner's disallowance of its objection, the Commissioner's file was in evidence before the primary Judge, Mason J, who held that the Commissioner had been entitled to be ""not satisfied"" of continuity of beneficial ownership. 81 The operation of s 190(b) of the ITAA was explained by Mason J (dissenting) in Gauci v Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 54 ; (1975) 135 CLR 81 at 89 as follows: ""Section 190(b) of the Act imposed on the appellants the burden of proving that the assessments were excessive. The appellants relied on their evidence and that of Graham [their land agent who acted for them] in order to show that the assessments were excessive. Once that evidence was rejected, the appellants' case necessarily failed. The Act does not place any onus on the Commissioner to show that the assessments were correctly made. Nor is there any statutory requirement that the assessments should be sustained or supported by evidence. The implication of such a requirement would be inconsistent with s. 190(b) for it is a consequence of that provision that unless the appellant shows by evidence that the assessment is incorrect, it will prevail."" The view expressed by Mason J in this passage has been endorsed: see McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284, esp at 302-304 (Gibbs J), 306 (Stephen J), 323 (Murphy J); Macmine Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1979) 53 ALJR 362, esp at 371 (Stephen J), 381 (Murphy J); Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614 esp at 624-5 (Brennan J with whom Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh agreed, and Deane J generally agreed) ("" Dalco ""). Practice Note No 22, referred to at [37], is consistent with it. 154 The position established by Peabody (see [119] above), Sleight (see [136] [145] above), and Syngenta (see [146] [150] above) seems to be that a distinction is to be drawn between cases in which the ITAA specifies a state of mind on which the assessment of the amount of taxable income (and tax) depends (cf Avon Downs , George , Giris , Duggan , Brian Hatch , Kolotex , WA Capital , Dalco ), and those in which it specifies, not a state of mind, but the making of a determination, as the event on which the amount of taxable income (and tax) depends (cf Jackson , Peabody , Richard Walter , Binetter, Sleight , Syngenta ). In the latter class of case, the legislature is taken to indicate that the interaction between s 177(1) of the ITAA and s 14ZZO(b) of the TAA produces the result that the Commissioner's state of mind, on the basis of which the determination was made, is part of the due making of the assessment, and cannot be put in issue by the taxpayer."
cited,Hafza v Director-General of Social Security (1985) 6 FCR 444,"As a general concept, residence has two elements: a physical presence in a particular place and the intention to treat that place as home ( Hafza v Director-General of Social Security (1985) 6 FCR 444 at 449; Taslim v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2004] FCA 789 ; (2004) 138 FCR 70 at [36] ). 9 Of course, once a person has established a home in a place, temporary absence from that place (for example, to take a holiday) does not bring the residence to an end. However, a person's residence in a place in which he or she is not present, depends on an intention to return and continue to treat that place as home ( Hafza at 449-450)."
cited,General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd (1971) 1A IPR 121,"and Lindgren JJ discussed in Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly &amp; Co (2005) 68 IPR 1 what was required to establish lack of novelty, at [313]: 313 The law relating to novelty under the 1990 Act was considered by the Full Court in Bristol-Myers Squibb. In the joint judgment of Black CJ and Lehane J, their Honours referred to what had been said by Aickin J in Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd [1977] HCA 19 ; (1977) 137 CLR 228 at 235; [1977] HCA 19 ; 13 ALR 605 at 611; [1977] HCA 19 ; 1A IPR 181 at 186: The basic test for anticipation or want of novelty is the same as that for infringement and generally one can properly ask oneself whether the alleged anticipation would, if the patent were valid, constitute an infringement. In the case of a paper anticipation such as a specification or publication, there can be no direct application of the reverse infringement test. An hypothetical infringement may be posited on the assumption that somebody does or makes what the alleged anticipation suggests. Their Honours cited Lord Westbury in Hill v Evans (at [63]): [63] ... the antecedent statement must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive, understand, and be able practically to apply the discovery without the necessity of making further experiments and gaining further information before the invention can be made useful. If something remains to be ascertained which is necessary for the useful application of the discovery, that affords sufficient room for another valid patent. Their Honours also referred to Flour Oxidizing Co Ltd v Carr &amp; Co Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 428 ; Canadian General Electric Co at 104 and General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd (1971) 1A IPR 121; [1972] RPC 457. After reviewing those authorities, they said (at [67]): [67] What all those authorities contemplate, in our view, is that a prior publication, if it is to destroy novelty, must give a direction or make a recommendation or suggestion which will result, if the skilled reader follows it, in the claimed invention. A direction, recommendation or suggestion may often, of course, be implicit in what is described and commonly the only question may be whether the publication describes with sufficient clarity the claimed invention or, in the case of a combination, each integer of it. Their Honours at [317] referred to the observations of Crennan J in Imperial Chemicals Industries Pty Ltd v Cmr of Patents (2004) 213 ALR 399 ; 63 IPR 476 ; [2004] FCA 1658 , where her Honour there quoted Sachs LJ in General Tire &amp; Rubber Co at [61]: [61] ... a signpost, however clear, upon the road to the patentee's invention will not suffice. The prior inventor must be clearly shown to have planted his flag at the precise destination before the patentee."
cited,"Sofia and Anor v Pattison and Anor [1997] VG 7619 (Unreported, Finkelstein J, 20 October 1997)","Sofia and Anor v Pattison and Anor , [1997] VG 7619 (Unreported, Finkelstein J, 20 October 1997), his Honour said: ""Whether the word ""file"" in s 54(1) is intended to be a reference to the act of the bankrupt or the act of the Registrar is unclear. But, having regard to the context in which the word is used it should be regarded as a reference to the act of the bankrupt. In the first place, the obligation that is imposed by s 54(1) is an obligation that is imposed on the bankrupt. In the second place the obligation is to file a document at a particular place namely at a Registry. This suggests that the statement will be filed when it is left with an officer at the Registry rather than when it has been placed on a file that is maintained at the Registry. Thus the section will be complied with whether or not the statement is subsequently placed on a file by the officer who received it."" This decision provides some assistance to Mr Lelleton. It is authority for the proposition that it cannot be concluded that a statement has not been filed for the purposes of s 54(1) simply because the document does not appear on a file maintained by the Registrar. Mr Lelleton did not, however, hand deliver his Statement to the Registry. He posted it and is unable to explain why it does not appear on file. There are a number of possibilities, the most obvious ones being that it went astray in the mail or, having been delivered to the Registry it was, for some unknown reason, not placed on file."
referred to,Dresna Pty Limited v Linknarf Management Services Pty Limited (In Liq) [2006] FCAFC 193,"There is force in Citigroup's submission that Australian law does not recognise a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure. The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive; accordingly, a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information: see Breen v Williams at 113 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ, 137-138 per Gummow J; Pilmer at [74] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; Aequitas at [283] [287] per Austin J; Dresna Pty Limited v Linknarf Management Services Pty Limited (In Liq) [2006] FCAFC 193 at [132] per Gyles J; P &amp; V Industries Pty Limited v Porto (No 2) [2007] VSC 64 at [29] per Hollingworth J."
cited,Corpique (No. 20) v Eastcourt (1989) 15 ACLR 586,"In the course of considering an entitlement asserted by a member or a member's proxy as to particular subject matter giving rise to a ruling, facts may need to be considered by the chair. Those facts may be relevant matters known by the chair by reason of circumstances surrounding the calling of a meeting or facts learnt in the course of the meeting or a combination of fact-finding circumstances. Some such facts, in another context, have been described as 'emergent questions, questions of fact that have to be decided then and there' ( McLean Bros. &amp; Rigg Ltd v Grice [1906] HCA 1 ; (1906) 4 CLR 835 at 860 per Barton J). A chair engaged in the conduct of a meeting is not in a position to undertake a 'voir dire' as to emergent factual contentions. He or she must hear the contentions of fact going to the question and decide the immediate question. A chair is not required to act judicially in deciding these questions before him or her. The chair is required to act 'bona fide' ( Corpique (No. 20) v Eastcourt (1989) 15 ACLR 586 at 596 per Cohen J) or at least in a way that is not 'neglectful' ( Corpique , per Cohen J at 596). On a question of whether the chair of a meeting of relevant members of a corporation, convened to consider a scheme of arrangement, had given members sufficient opportunity to debate the merits of the scheme, McLelland J, in Direct Acceptance Corporation Ltd (1987) 5 ACLC 1037 at 1041, said, 'However, on such a matter as this, the chairman as a matter of law has a wide discretion with which the court will not interfere unless the exercise of that discretion can be shown to be invalid, e.g. on the ground that it was exercised in bad faith' . In Fast Scout Ltd v Bergel &amp; Ors (2001) 40 ACSR 376 , Templeman J considered, in the context of a ruling relating to the validity of proxies, that 'generally, a chairman's decision will be amenable to review by the court if he makes an error of law' . Assuming the chair has exercised the jurisdiction conferred upon him by the meeting and the relevant instruments in good faith, the notion that his or her decision will be amenable to review on a ground of error of law although supported by established authority is more recently supported by a decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in Link Agricultural Pty Ltd v Shanahan &amp; Ors [1998] VSCA 3 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 498. Kenny JA with whom Batt JA and Buchanan J agreed, accepted that the powers exercisable by the chair are not unfettered and 'broadly speaking' the powers could not be exercised 'unlawfully' to deprive members of their votes (Kenny JA at 511). The decision taken by the chair to refuse Shanahan extra time to lodge his 'proxy holder card' after a particular deadline with the result that proxy voters lost the benefit of their right to vote, failed a test of legality [my term] because the chair's decision was not taken for the purpose of the power conferred by the Act (Kenny JA at pp 512 and 513). Kenny JA put the test in these terms, 'Whether or not there was error in the chairman's ruling depends on whether it was made in good faith and for [the] purpose. The ruling will be invalid if made in bad faith or for an ulterior or impermissible purpose' (Kenny JA at p 511). In Perera v Reilly (2006) 59 ACSR 317 , Murray J considered the intersection between s 253G of the Act and the approach to supervisory review of decisions of a chair of the meeting and said this: [45] The provision is designed to facilitate the despatch of corporate business by decisions taken at meetings. In that context, it has often been held that such a provision will operate as a privative provision, rendering the decision not amenable to judicial review if the power is exercised bona fide, albeit mistakenly ... at least in cases where there has been no error of law."

referred to,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; 231 ALR 592,"because of the repetition of complaints as to the manner in which the hearing was conducted, in effect alleging failure to accord procedural fairness and bias, I have read the transcript of what occurred at that hearing in the light of the later reasons of the Tribunal and in the light of the nature of the complaints made in the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court and repeated in this Court. I have also taken into account the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; 231 ALR 592. Having done so, I agree with the submission by counsel for the Minister that there is nothing in that decision which causes any disquiet as to whether there was lack of procedural fairness or bias in the present circumstances. Scarlett FM adequately dealt with the criticisms of the Tribunal's procedure. However, one aspect of the matter concerned me. The appellant's basic case was that he feared persecution if he returned to China on account of his practising the Christian religion in association with an unregistered church. He claimed to have been converted to Christianity by a fellow labourer in a construction gang who spread the gospel amongst gang members who met and studied the Bible at secret gatherings. He was baptised by a priest organised by the fellow labourer who also led the group into seeking to spread the gospel to other labourers and local villagers with religious propaganda materials. This, he claimed, led to persecution at the hands of local authorities. This caused him to flee China and come to Australia. He claims to have practised Christianity at a local Sydney church since arrival in Australia. During the course of the hearing the Tribunal member referred to some particular country information and made it clear that she had difficulty in believing that studying the Bible with a small group of workers, not being of a particular denominational group or of a particular belief, would be regarded as a church in the eyes of the Communist government."
cited,Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"In Guo at 573, the High Court also affirmed what was said in Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 281, that an opinion that one version of the facts is more probable than another is not necessarily inconsistent with the correct application of the Chan test. 46 In Rajalingam Sackville J, with whom North J agreed, discussed the various observations concerning the obligation of the Tribunal to consider, in its assessment of well-founded fear as discussed by the High Court in Guo and Wu Shan Liang , whether there is ""real doubt"" that findings of fact as to past events were correct. At [60] Sackville J distilled those observations into the principle that there are circumstances in which the Tribunal must take into account the possibility that alleged past events occurred, even though it finds that those events probably did not occur. If the Tribunal makes an adverse finding in relation to a material claim of an appellant but is unable to make the claim with confidence, it must proceed to assess the claim on the basis that the claim may possibly be true. There are, however, limits to the application of this principle, known as the ""what if I am wrong"" test. This does not preclude the Tribunal making a finding with certainty. It is where the Tribunal is uncertain as to whether an alleged event occurred or finds that the event might have occurred that it should, in considering the ultimate question, take into account the possibility that it did take place (at [62])."
referred to,ACE Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728,"ACE Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728 Weinberg J set out a number of principles which he considered to be relevant on an application of this nature. His Honour said: 'The authorities which govern the operation of s 459G of the Corporations Law seem to me to establish the following propositions: &#61863; The respondent is presumed to be insolvent and as such bears the onus of proving its solvency: s 459C(2) and (3); Elite Motor Campers Australia v Leisureport Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 235 per Spender J; Commissioner of Taxation v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd .

Nor are bald assertions of solvency arising from a general review of the accounts, even if made by qualified accountants who have detailed knowledge of how those accounts were prepared: Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd ( supra); Re Citic Commodity Trading Pty Ltd v JBL Enterprises (WA) Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 232 per Heerey J; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 459 at 463 per Sackville J. &#61863; There is a distinction between solvency and a surplus of assets. A company may be at the same time insolvent and wealthy. The nature of a company's assets, and its ability to convert those assets into cash within a relatively short time, at least to the extent of meeting all its debts as and when they fall due, must be considered in determining solvency: Rees v Bank of New South Wales [1964] HCA 47 ; (1964) 111 CLR 210; Re Tweeds Garages Ltd [1962] Ch 406 at 410 per Plowman J; Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (supra); Melbase Corporation Pty Ltd v Segenhoe Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 823 at 832 per Lindgren J; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (supra) at 465-466. &#61863; The adoption of a cash flow test for solvency does not mean that the extent of the company's assets is irrelevant to the inquiry. The credit resources available to the company must also be taken into account: Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 671 per Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan and Windeyer JJ agreed); Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (supra) at 466; Taylor v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1988) 6 ACLC 808 at 812 per McGarvie J. &#61863; The question of solvency must be assessed at the date of the hearing. However, this does not mean that future events are to be ignored: Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (supra) at 466-467. &#61863; It is no abuse of process for an applicant to seek to wind up a company presumed to be insolvent by reason of its failure to comply with a statutory demand merely because that company contends that it is solvent, or because there may be alternative means available to the applicant to vindicate its rights : Elite Motor Campers Australia v Leisureport Pty Ltd (supra).'"

referred to,Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (1999) 164 ALR 203,"It is significant to recall that all parties needed to confront the principal question in the proceedings on the basis there existed only one previous decision of the Court that of Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (1999) 164 ALR 203 (' Hamersley ') which dealt with the interpretation of the term ""use of a production process"" within s 44B of the Act and which involved a very similar factual scenario to the proceedings. Fortescue's principal contention was that, applying the ""marketable commodity"" test to the factual scenario as contended for by Fortescue, a ""marketable commodity"" was produced in BHPBIO's operations before the iron ore was railed to the port. As an alternative contention, Fortescue sought to distinguish Hamersley on a number of grounds. 30 BHPBIO had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately. Nevertheless, BHPBIO was the losing party, and Fortescue would ordinarily be entitled to its costs. However, despite Fortescue's ultimate success in the proceedings, I did not find in favour of Fortescue on certain factual and legal issues or inquiries. Nevertheless, I do not consider it appropriate in the circumstances to disentitle Fortescue to its whole costs in the proceedings. 31 The conduct of Fortescue in this proceeding was neither inappropriate nor unreasonable. Fortescue structured its case primarily on the basis of the correctness of the decision in Hamersley . Therefore, it seems to me that seeking to apply the ""marketable commodity"" test as expounded in that decision was an entirely appropriate and reasonable approach. Further, it seems to me that Fortescue seeking in the alternative to distinguish the Hamersley decision on a number of grounds was similarly appropriate and reasonable. In addition, I do not see any inappropriate or unreasonable behaviour on the part of Fortescue in its approach to putting BHPBIO to proof on factual matters or contentions. The Court accepted in essence the actual process and operations as contended for by BHPBIO. However, the conclusions of the Court were determined objectively and not by reference to BHPBIO's own subjective views or characterisations, or by reference to the subjective views or characterisations of the witnesses called on behalf of BHPBIO. Fortescue was entitled to test the evidence put forward by BHPBIO, especially in respect of such subjective views and characterisations. 32 In Hamersley , the learned trial judge held the term ""production process"" meant ""a series of operations by which a marketable commodity is created or manufactured"": at 213. The test required, as a question of ""fact and degree"", a consideration of ""the actual operation of the activities in question, considered as a whole"": at 213. The evidence as to ""marketable commodity"", whilst it may be separately identified, was all part of the material the Court needed to consider in determining the actual operation of the activities in question. Accordingly, it does not seem unreasonable for Fortescue to have approached in the way it did the material placed before the Court. The principal question for determination in the proceedings was not a mere matter of statutory interpretation of the term ""the use of a production process"" that could be dealt with by demurrer. Rather, the Court was required to consider, in detail, the factual evidence of BHPBIO's operations and apply the construction of the term ""the use of a production process"", whether that construction be the one set out in Hamersley , or the construction for which the Court ultimately found. There does not seem to me to be any element of unreasonableness or inappropriateness in Fortescue directing its evidence, submissions and cross-examination to the application of that test to the facts of this case. 33 This is not the end of the inquiry. As I have indicated, the exercise of the discretion to make an order as to costs is not just limited to a consideration of the reasonableness or appropriateness of the conduct of a party in connection with the proceedings. It may also be appropriate to discount an order in favour of a successful litigant in circumstances where it has lost certain issues or inquiries which can clearly be treated as distinct and severable. 34 At the outset, I do not consider that the matters upon which Fortescue was unsuccessful were relevantly distinct or severable although they can be identified. Rather, the matters on which Fortescue was unsuccessful were alternative arguments in support of the one principal question in the proceedings, that is, whether either of the relevant services was a ""service"" within the meaning of s 44B of the Act. The matters raised by Fortescue were sufficiently linked to this principal question in the proceedings. Fortescue did not seek to raise a separate matter for determination by way of a positive defence. 35 However, to the extent the issues or inquiries upon which Fortescue lost can be identified, and even if they be relevantly distinct and severable, in my view, none of the matters sought to be addressed by Fortescue were so disproportionate to the whole case, or so lacked merit, or so adversely impacted upon the economy and efficiency of the proceedings, according to case management principles, as to warrant an order to deprive Fortescue of some or all of its costs. As I have said, I was required to consider in detail the factual evidence and apply that evidence to the construction of the term ""use of a production process"", which Fortescue reasonably contested. The ultimate ends of justice would not be served by Fortescue not recovering its costs because of its failure on some identifiable (or even distinct and severable) issues or inquiries, when those issues or inquiries needed to be canvassed as being material to the reaching of a decision."
referred to,Australian Crime Commission v NTD8 [2009] FCAFC 86,"summons itself refers to a special investigation and it has the determination attached to it. The determination plainly relates to a special investigation. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances document refers to a special investigation and to the determination and the Legal Submissions document refers to the determination and to a special investigation. It seems to me that, looking at the documents as a whole, it has not been established that the second respondent misunderstood the nature of the instrument pursuant to which he was issuing the summons. It is more likely that some of the dangers of using a standard form document have been realised (see the observations of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Crime Commission v NTD8 [2009] FCAFC 86 at [34]). The second ground upon which the applicant challenged the second respondent's decision to issue the second summons was that he misunderstood the exercise he was performing. The applicant referred to the fact that the Legal Submissions document is referred to under the heading, ""Material Facts"" and to the fact that in one part of the reasons he states that he had regard to ""&#169; My knowledge obtained from a recent examination"" and yet when setting out his conclusions under the heading ""Consideration"" he makes no reference to that piece of information. It seems to me that, however one looks at those matters, neither of them establishes an error which is a jurisdictional error. The third ground upon which the applicant challenged the second respondent's decision to issue the second summons is that the second respondent did not consider, or properly consider, the inclusion of the notation referred to in s 29A of the Act. In formulating his reasons for including the notation, there is nothing to prevent the second respondent from relying on each of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) in s 29A(2) (see [35] above). Furthermore, it is clear from the reference in paragraph 6), ""in the terms approved by me"", (see [8] above) that he addressed the terms of the notation."

followed,Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1577 ; (2002) ATC 5201; (2002) 51 ATR 629,"In the case before me the applicant is asking the Court to confirm an interpretation of the definition of 'fringe benefit' which has been previously applied in four cases decided by judges of the Federal Court, and to find that that interpretation is applicable in the case now before me. Further, the applicant is asking the Court to require the Commissioner to rule in accordance with that interpretation. The foundation of this interpretation is in the judgment of Kiefel J in Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1577 ; (2002) ATC 5201; (2002) 51 ATR 629 where her Honour held that the definition of 'fringe benefit' as defined by subs 136(1) Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth) (' FBTAA ') requires reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit said to have been provided. In the absence of reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit, the benefit provided is not a 'fringe benefit' for the purposes of the FBTAA . 5 I have referred to four cases in which this interpretation has been applied. These cases are: 1. Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1577 ; (2002) ATC 5201; (2002) 51 ATR 629 (a decision of Kiefel J); 2.

He has made submissions to this effect, referring to Australian Taxation Office Media Release Nat 03/30. Further, in the Explanation attached to the Private Ruling provided to the applicant, the Commissioner confirmed that his views as expressed in Taxation Ruling 1999/5 remained the ATO position notwithstanding the decision in Essenbourne . The Commissioner in the case before me is asking the Court to reconsider the interpretation of 'fringe benefit' articulated in Essenbourne . 7 This application, and the position taken by the Commissioner, both practically in disallowing the applicant's objection and legally in his submissions, lead in my view to two key questions which require decision by this Court: 1. Should this Court apply the interpretation of 'fringe benefit' as applied in Essenbourne , specifically that there will be no fringe benefit unless there is identification of particular employees in connection with the receipt of the benefit? 2. If the Court should apply that interpretation, was a fringe benefit provided within the meaning of s 136(1) FBTAA in the case before me? 8 Before going to those questions, it is appropriate to consider the relevant history of this matter, in particular: &#8226; details of the proposal the subject of the appeal; &#8226; Question 1 in the Application for the Private Ruling submitted by the applicant and other rulees; &#8226; the case of the applicant in submitting that the issue of shares in ABC Learning Centres Ltd ('ABC Public') to the trustee of the Carers Share Plan ('CSP') did not give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to either ABC Public or the rulee Regional Management Companies ('RMCs'); and &#8226; the reasons of the Commissioner in making a ruling unfavourable to the applicant, which forms the primary focus of this application. 9 The factual background to this application and the arrangement proposed by the applicant are not in dispute in the sense that: &#8226; the facts were substantially detailed in Appendix 4 to the Application for Private Ruling submitted by Harris Black Chartered Accountants on 2 June 2005, on behalf of the list of rulees named in Appendix 1 to that Application. The applicant in the case before me is one of those rulees; and &#8226; those facts were essentially reproduced in the 'Outline of the relevant facts' contained in a letter under the hand of Mr Paul Duffus, Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, on 30 June 2005, containing the Private Ruling produced by the Australian Taxation Office in response to the Application for Private Ruling. 18 So far as is relevant for present purposes, the case of the applicant is as follows: &#8226; the ABC Public shares were provided by ABC Public to the trustee of the CSP. ABC Public was not an associate of the RMCs whose employees potentially could receive a benefit; &#8226; the ABC Public shares were provided by the trustee of the CSP to particular employees. The trustee was also not an associate of those RMCs; &#8226; no employee had any entitlement to ABC Public shares unless and until he or she qualified for appointment, and was appointed those shares by the trustee of the CSP; &#8226; there was no sufficient or material link between the issue of shares by ABC Public to the trustee of the CSP, and the employment of any employee of an RMC. Instead, the CSP acted as a true incentive to the employees to remain in employment with an RMC because an employee could only benefit if and when the trustee of the CSP exercised its discretion in his or her favour. When the trustee exercised its discretion in an employee's favour, any benefit in the form of dividends or shares would be assessable income to the employee; &#8226; in order to fall within the definition of 'fringe benefit', the relevant benefit must be in respect of the employment of the employee : Essenbourne . In this case, no specific employees were identified as being in receipt of benefits under the proposal; and &#8226; the proposal could properly be characterised as falling within the exclusionary principles in par (ha) of the definition of 'fringe benefit' in s 136(1) FBTAA , namely that it was 'a benefit constituted by the acquisition by a person of a share or right under an employee share scheme (within the meaning of Div 13A of Pt III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 )'. Such schemes are specifically excluded from being a 'fringe benefit' by par (ha) of the definition. 19 Detailed reasons for the answer to Question 1 were set out in a document entitled 'EXPLANATION: (This does not form part of the Notice of Private Ruling)'. This document was attached to the Notice of Private Ruling Authorisation Number 53514, which was in turn sent by letter dated 30 June 2005 under the hand of Mr Duffus of the Australian Taxation Office to Harris Black Chartered Accountants. 20 In summary, the reasons that the issue of ABC Public shares to the trustee of the CSP were deemed by the Commissioner to give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to the rulee RMCs as employers were as follows: &#8226; shares are considered to be property and therefore a 'benefit' for the purposes of the FBTAA ; &#8226; when ABC Public issued shares to the trustee, ABC Public was considered to provide property to the trustee pursuant to s 154 FBTAA ; &#8226; the trustee of the CSP was considered to be 'an associate' of an employee where the employee was capable of benefiting under the trust. Therefore when ABC Public issued shares to the trustee of a trust and an employee was capable of benefiting under that trust, a benefit would be provided to an associate of the employee; &#8226; in considering whether one of the ABC entities could be a relevant person for the purposes of either par (e) or par (ea) of the definition of 'fringe benefit', there appears to have been some confusion in the Explanation. In the Commissioner's analysis with respect to whether an ABC entity could be 'an arranger' for the purposes of par (e), the Commissioner refers to 'ABC issu(ing) shares to the trustee of a trust' and 'ABC intends to issue shares to the trustee for the benefit of the RMCs employees', when the entity actually issuing the shares was ABC Public. (In the final analysis, the Commissioner was of the view that it was arguable that the entity issuing shares was not an 'arranger' within the meaning of par (e)); &#8226; in relation to the possible operation of par (ea) however, the Commissioner was of the view that ABC would be 'a person (the provider)' if: o the RMCs participated in or facilitated the issue of shares to the trustee, and knew or ought to have known they were doing so; or o the RMCs participated in, facilitated or promoted the CSP, and knew or ought to have known they were doing so; The Commissioner stated in the Explanation that if the RMCs were to provide this information to the trustee 'they would be participating in or facilitating the issue of shares to the trustee and participating in or facilitating the CSP and would know or ought reasonably to know they were doing so. Where the information was provided to the trustee by ABC, the RMCs are still considered to be participating in or facilitating the issue of shares to the trustee and participating in or facilitating the CSP, because it is only as a result of their agreement with the ABC (under the Licence Agreement) that ABC is able to provide this information'. This reasoning was further explained by the Commissioner in the letter of 13 September 2005 to Harris Black Chartered Accountants, setting out the Reasons for Decision of the Commissioner in finding against the applicant in relation to its Notice of Objection Against Private Ruling. The Commissioner, through Mr Duffus, pointed out in that letter that: &#8226; ABC also provided information to ABC Public for ABC Public to calculate the gifting of shares to the trustee; &#8226; ABC only had that information to allow it to prepare the payrolls for the RMCs; and &#8226; the only way ABC could lawfully pass on such information to ABC Public was with the participation or facilitation of the RMCs. The Commissioner was of the view that in these circumstances the RMCs would know, or ought reasonably to know, that the RMCs were doing so pursuant to par (ea). Accordingly in the view of the Commissioner it followed that for the purposes of par (ea) of the definition of 'fringe benefit', ABC was 'a person (the provider)'; &#8226; the Commissioner noted that 'fringe benefit' in s 136(1) FBTAA meant, inter alia , a benefit provided in 'respect of the employment of the employee'. In his view the CSP operated as an employee incentive scheme providing rewards to RMC employees for services they provided as employees. Accordingly, the issue of shares by ABC Public to the trustee of the CSP was a product or incident of the employment of the RMC employees; &#8226; the reference in the definition of 'fringe benefit' to a benefit being provided to 'an employee' meant that a fringe benefit could arise notwithstanding that a benefit provided to a trust might not be provided in respect of a specific employee; &#8226; in any event, the Commissioner was of the view that the facts in this case were arguably distinguishable from those in Essenbourne . In particular, the Commissioner noted that cl 36 app 4 to the Application for Private Ruling stated that the initial issue of ordinary shares by ABC Public would be calculated by reference to the number of employees who had signed an AWA, held positions as set out in that document and had served a certain full-time period in that position at an ABC centre. The Commissioner said that therefore, it was arguable that the shares issued to the trustee of the CSP were shares provided in respect of the employment of particular employees. 21 In the Explanation, the Commissioner continued to maintain the views expressed in TR 1999/5, in preference to the views of Kiefel J in Essenbourne . TR 1999/5 explains the approach of the Commissioner to circumstances where property is gifted to a trust and an employee who is a beneficiary of that trust is able to benefit from that gift. As explained by par [1] of TR 1999/5, the Ruling considers, inter alia , whether a payment by an employer of money (which does not constitute salary or wages or an exempt benefit) to the trustee of a trust or non-complying superannuation fund is a fringe benefit, and the value of that benefit. The view was expressed in the Explanation that the Ruling applied to the circumstances of this case, and that further for reasons outlined in pars 45-49 of TR 1999/5 a fringe benefit could arise notwithstanding that a benefit provided to a trust was not provided in respect of a specific employee. 22 Paragraphs 45-49 of the Ruling are as follows: '[45] The definition of fringe benefit in subsection 136(1) is in relation to ""an employee"". It is considered that there will be a fringe benefit, notwithstanding the payment of the money to the trust is not in respect of a specific employee. Such a construction is the natural consequence of the use of the indefinite article ""an"". It is sufficient if the benefit is provided in relation to employees generally. [46] Alternatively, where the contribution is not made in respect of a particular employee or employees, the benefit will be provided in relation to each and every employee (as the trust or non-complying superannuation fund may be for the benefit of all employee). [47] The foregoing construction of the definition of fringe benefit is supported by the fact that paragraph 136(1)(hb) specifically exempts from the definition: ""a benefit constituted by the acquisition by a trust of money or other property where the sole activities of the trust are obtaining shares...in a company...of the employer, and providing those shares... to employees of the employer ; [emphasis added]."" [48] Such an exclusion would be otiose if the definition of fringe benefit did not include benefits provided to an associate of the employees in respect of the employees generally. [49] An alternative view relies on the reference to ""the employee"" in paragraph (b) of the definition of fringe benefit. As outlined above, we do not accept this view.' 23 By objection dated 14 July 2005 the applicant objected to the ruling of the Commissioner in response to Question 1 of the Ruling Application. As I noted earlier in this judgment, the Commissioner disallowed the objection in a letter of 13 September 2005 containing the Notice of Decision on Objection. 24 An Application was then filed with this Court whereby the applicant appealed against the appealable objection decision. 25 In answering this question, it is helpful to consider: &#8226; relevant legislative provisions under the FBTAA ; &#8226; the decisions and reasoning in Essenbourne and subsequent cases; and &#8226; principles of precedent. 33 Whether the trustee in this case is an associate of the employees within the meaning of the legislation will be considered later in this judgment. The Cases Essenbourne 34 As I have already noted, the first issue involves consideration of 'fringe benefit' as decided in Essenbourne . It is useful therefore to consider the case and the principle articulated by Kiefel J, currently in dispute. 35 In Essenbourne , the employer was a family company which owned a motor dealership in Queensland. The three key employees were three sons of the Marino family, which controlled Essenbourne Pty Ltd. The sons received low salaries in keeping with the corporate strategy of coping with periods of business downturn, and enabling surplus funds to be re-invested in profitable years. In light of the low salaries, a superannuation fund, an employee share fund and an employee incentive trust were established to provide benefits primarily to the three employees of Essenbourne Pty Ltd who were family members. This was in addition to the salaries they received, and in order to retain their services. 36 Various capital contributions were made to each entity, however the critical payment for present purposes was a contribution by Essenbourne Pty Ltd of $252 000 to the employer incentive trust on 30 June 1997. This sum was calculated on the advice of the solicitor of Essenbourne Pty Ltd, and was equivalent to the sum which could be contributed to the superannuation fund on the basis of the age of all members of the superannuation fund. On the same day, the three key employees were allotted each one third of the Employee Units in the trust, ie 84,000 units each. The employees were not required to pay for those units. 37 The Trust Deed of the employee incentive trust provided that the Trust was to provide benefits and incentives to employees, and that the employer (Essenbourne Pty Ltd) was to make contributions for the benefit of 'its employees generally' (cl 5.1). Further, the Deed allowed the trustee to issue Bonus Units in respect of Employee Units to the holders of those units on such basis as the trustee, with the consent of the employee, might determine (cl 10.1). 41 As Kiefel J noted, the Commissioner had not suggested the three brothers, employees of Essenbourne Pty Ltd, were entitled to the trust money or the property in which the money was invested. Her Honour also observed that under the Trust, the brothers had only the prospect of Bonus Units issuing (par 50). 42 While Kiefel J accepted the Commissioner's proposition that it was not necessary that an employee be in receipt of a benefit where it has been provided to an associate of that employee, the fact of provision of a benefit to an associate is not enough in itself to make that benefit a 'fringe benefit' within the meaning of the FBTAA . As her Honour pointed out: 'The difficulty in the Commissioner's approach is that it does not identify a benefit to a particular employee. The statute may deem a benefit to be provided to an employee where it is provided to the employee's trustee, but this would not obviate the apparent necessity to identify the employee in question. The definition of 'fringe benefit' would appear to require the identification of the employee to whom the benefit is provided. This is the principal contention of Essenbourne.' (par 51) (emphasis added) 43 Her Honour agreed with the contention of Essenbourne Pty Ltd that the definition of 'fringe benefit' required reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit said to be provided. This requirement of the definition was not, in Kiefel J's view, satisfied in Essenbourne . Given the nature of the contest before me, it is important and relevant to set out her Honour's reasoning on this point: '[54] In my view Essenbourne is correct in its contention that the definition of ""fringe benefit"" requires reference to a particular employee in connexion with the benefit said to have been provided. This is reflected in the references to a benefit being ""provided to the employee or to an associate of the employee"" and to the benefit being provided ""in respect of the employment of the employee"" (emphasis added). The latter reference, in particular, can only be to a particular person's employment. The Commissioner submitted that the reference to ""an employee"" in the definition should be read as ""employees"", in the case of certain benefits, as s 23 Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) would permit. In my view the Assessment Act requires that the particular employee be identified in connexion with the benefit. It is their employment which, after all, provides the necessary ""link"" to the benefit: see J &amp; G Knowles &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v FC of T [2000] FCA 196 ; (2000) 96 FCR 402. The definition does not admit of a reference to a number of employees in connexion with the benefit, the subject of the assessment. ... [56] The link between the benefit and the employment of the employee is required to be sufficient or material: J &amp; G Knowles, 409, 410. It arises because of the words 'in respect of the employment'. A mere causal link with the employment of the employee will not be sufficient. Essenbourne submits that, at least until the issue of Bonus Units, there is not a sufficient connexion with the brothers' employment. It seems to me that the substantial link at this point is as between the payment and the deduction sought by Essenbourne. It is not necessary for me to further consider the point for, in my view, the payment by Essenbourne to the trustee does not qualify as a fringe benefit as it is defined.' 44 Accordingly, on the facts of the case, Kiefel J held that the benefits provided were not 'fringe benefits'. Walstern, Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions 45 In each of the Federal Court decisions Walstern , Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions , the learned judge followed and applied the principles decided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne . 46 In Walstern , Hill J decisively and unambiguously agreed with Kiefel J in Essenbourne on this issue. His Honour said: '(at 22) As I have already noted, I would, as a matter of comity, follow the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless the case was either distinguishable or I was of the view that the decision was clearly wrong. On this point the case is not distinguishable. Further, far from being of the view that her Honour was clearly wrong, I am of the view that her Honour was clearly right. The definition of ""fringe benefit"" in s 136(1) of the FBTA Act makes clear the importance of identification of the employee. The benefit itself is one which is said to be ""in relation to an employee"". The benefit is required to have been provided to the employee (or associate of the employee) and is required to be in respect of the employment of the employee. The definition of ""property fringe benefit"" (if that is the kind of benefit relied upon) requires relevantly provision of property to a particular person there referred to as ""the recipient"". The valuation formula relevantly here requires that there be a benefit provided ""to a person"" in respect of the employment of an employee. Any contribution made by an individual employee is taken into account in determining the taxable value of the benefit. Although not relevant in the present case, the exclusion of a benefit otherwise deductible to an employee contemplates taking into account the specific circumstances of the employee himself or herself. It is not surprising that the legislation requires a link between the benefit and a particular employee (or associate of a particular employee) because historically the purpose of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 (Cth) is to provide a specific means of taxing benefits which are a substitute for income to an employee and in respect of which the provisions of the 1936 Act and particular s 26(e) were thought to be defective. Income tax is a tax upon the taxable income of a particular employee. While fringe benefits tax is a tax for which an employer is made liable and is payable at the maximum personal income tax rate, the theory of fringe benefits tax legislation is that it operates as a final withholding tax payable by the employer on amounts that essentially are or would be income of the employee...' 48 Finally, in Caelli Constructions Kenny J assumed that Essenbourne correctly stated the law, and applied the principle to the facts of the case (par 61). 49 As I have already noted, in Walstern (at FCA par 87 per Hill J) and Caelli Constructions (at FCA par 61 per Kenny J) their Honours stated their views that the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne was correct, and stated the law. Merkel J in Spotlight Stores did not need to discuss the Essenbourne case in great detail, however his Honour observed that he proposed to follow Essenbourne and Walstern as, notwithstanding the submissions of the Commissioner in Spotlight Stores , his Honour was not satisfied that those decisions were clearly wrong (at FCA par 121). Hill J in Walstern had also indicated that, as a matter of comity, he would have followed the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless he had formed the view either it was distinguishable or that the decision was clearly wrong, neither of which was the case (at par 87). 52 Accordingly, in my view it would be appropriate to follow the principle articulated in Essenbourne and followed by three other judges of the Federal Court before me, unless in my view the principle is clearly wrong, or the facts before me are distinguishable. 53 Notwithstanding powerful submissions by the Commissioner, I am not satisfied that the principle articulated by Kiefel J in Essenbourne is clearly wrong. With respect, there is little to add to the reasons provided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne or Hill J in Walstern which have been repeated in this judgment. I agree with the four judges in Essenbourne, Walstern, Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions that the identification of particular employees is a requisite element in the application of the definition of 'fringe benefit' under the FBTAA . Like the judges in Walstern , Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions I propose to follow the Essenbourne decision and, to the extent it is applicable to the facts of the case before me, apply it. 55 As I take the view that I should apply the interpretation of 'fringe benefit' as applied in Essenbourne , it is necessary to consider whether the facts of the case before me are distinguishable in such a fashion that the principle is not applicable. So far as is relevant in the context of this case, the question is whether the ABC Public shares, which are the benefits in question, have been provided in respect of the employment of a particular employee or employees . 58 If, as the applicant contends, the employees are not identified with sufficient particularity, in my view the question of the benefit being 'in respect of' their employment does not arise. As Kiefel J pointed out in Essenbourne , 'It is their employment which, after all, provides the necessary ""link"" to the benefit: see J &amp; G Knowles &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 196 ; (2000) 96 FCR 402.' 59 The Commissioner has submitted that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in Essenbourne , and that if it was necessary to establish that the provision of benefits was in respect of particular employees, this was the case. The Commissioner has submitted in summary: &#8226; beneficiaries were identifiable precisely from the terms of the CSP Deed, in particular clause 1.1 which states: 'Beneficiary' means, at any time, any employee of an Employer RMC who: (a) is registered as a party to an Australian Workplace Agreement with an Employer RMC; and (b) holds the position of assistant, group leader, director or regional manager with an Employer RMC; other than an Excluded Person. &#8226; the employment plainly is the explanation for the provision of the benefit in the form of the ABC Public shares in respect of employees who are beneficiaries under the CSP Deed this was clearly described in the application for the private ruling; &#8226; the selection criteria are incorporated into the terms of the CSP Deed, and the CSP Deed requires the trustee to have regard to those criteria in exercising its power of appointment; &#8226; the benefit is provided by ABC Public as 'the arranger' within the meaning of par (e) of the definition of 'fringe benefit' in s 136(1) FBTAA . The Commissioner submits that 'arrangement' is defined in very broad terms by s 136(1) FBTAA , and the context for the proposed plan as outlined in the ruling application evidences that the issue of the shares is made under an 'arrangement' between ABC Public and the relevant RMCs, notwithstanding the particular facts relied on by the applicant; and &#8226; in the alternative, the benefit is provided by ABC Public within the meaning of subpara (ea), on the basis that there is participation and/or facilitation by the RMCs in the provision of the share issue to their employees, and knowledge by the RMCs (or they ought reasonably to know) that they are doing so. 60 In my view the issue of whether a benefit has been provided by ABC Public as 'the arranger' within subpara (e) of the definition of 'fringe benefit' in s 136(1) FBTAA , or provided by ABC Public within the meaning of subpara (ea) of that definition, does not arise, because in my view the benefits provided in this case were not 'in respect of the employment of the employee '. 61 It is instructive to compare the proposal before me, the rights of the employees who are potential beneficiaries under the CSP Deed, and the extent to which they are identified, with the facts in Essenbourne . Indeed, the interpretation of 'fringe benefit' articulated by Kiefel J in Essenbourne appears even more relevant to the facts in this case before me than it was in Essenbourne . In my view the applicant's case before me is stronger than it was before her Honour. 62 Relevant aspects of the arrangement in this case include: &#8226; the benefits in question, namely the shares in ABC Public, were provided by ABC Public, which, notwithstanding that was the holding company of the statutory licensee, was not in any relationship with the employees who would receive the shares which are alleged to constitute the fringe benefit. The provider of the benefits was therefore more remote from the employees than was the case in Essenbourne , where the entity which contributed some of the capital to the fund was the employer of potential beneficiaries; &#8226; the trustee of the CSP under the CSP Deed was an independent professional trustee. This can be compared with, for example, the trustee in Essenbourne where the trustee was a corporate entity of which potential beneficiaries were directors; &#8226; in the case before me the potential beneficiaries were defined in the CSP Deed as RMC employees who satisfied various criteria. The relationship between the provider of the shares, ABC Public, the regional managers and the RMCs was within the framework of a franchise structure. Importantly, any future employees of existing RMCs, or of future RMCs which later came into existence and entered an arrangement with ABC Public, could also potentially qualify as beneficiaries of the CSP. The arrangement in this case did not involve potential provision for family members associated with the employer company as was the case in Essenbourne ; &#8226; the CSP was a discretionary trust , with the trustee vested with powers to appoint income and capital of the trust fund among the beneficiaries on such terms and in such proportions as it saw fit. This is clear from cl 3.3 and cl 4.4 of the CSP Deed. Although the trustee was required by cl 3.4 and cl 4.5 of the CSP Deed to act reasonably and to have regard to the selection criteria provided in the CSP Deed, in my view this did not override the discretionary powers of the trustee. The position of the trustee was reinforced by cl 8.7 of the CSP Deed, which provided that every trust, power, authority and discretion of the trustee was absolute and uncontrolled. This was similar to Essenbourne where the Trust Deed provided for the employer to make contributions for the benefit of 'its employees generally' and employees were entitled to subscribe for Employee Units, however distributions of income to employee unit holders was determined from time to time by the trustee. Further, in Essenbourne employees were not entitled to receive Bonus Units unless certain conditions had been satisfied including periods of time as full time employees of Essenbourne Pty Ltd; &#8226; although the calculation of the initial issue of shares by ABC Public to the trustee of the CSP may have been by reference to the total number of employees of the applicant and the other RMCs at that time: &#8226; clearly no immediate benefit could be provided in respect of future employees of the RMCs, who were nonetheless future potential beneficiaries; &#8226; the identification by the trustee of employees who satisfied the selection criteria to the extent that the trustee was required to distribute trust property to those employees, as already discussed was an event to take place after initial issue, which meant that at the time the contribution was to be made to the trustee no identified RMC employees were beneficiaries of the CSP; &#8226; it is also feasible that additional RMC employees could become parties to new AWAs without further shares necessarily being issued by ABC Public to the trustee; and &#8226; on the facts it would also be possible for shares to be issued to the trustee in batches for employees generally, without reference to particular employees. 63 As counsel for the applicant submitted, a far stronger connection existed between the contributions made for the employees and each employee's employment in Essenbourne , than existed between the proposed share issue by ABC Public and any particular RMC employee's employment. 75 The applicant has also submitted that the Commissioner was wrong to decide that he was not bound by previous decisions of the Federal Court following and including Essenbourne . On the facts of the case before me, it is unnecessary for me to consider this issue. THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 1. The appeal against the appealable objection decision made by the Commissioner of Taxation under s 14ZY of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) to disallow in full the applicant's taxation objection against the private ruling issued to the applicant for the FBT years ended 31 March 2006 to 31 March 2011 be allowed. 2. The Commissioner's decision be set aside, and substituted with the decision that the applicant's taxation objection be allowed in full. 3. The objection decision should have been as follows: a. the correct response to Question 1 of the ruling application is that the proposed issue of shares by ABC Learning Centres Limited to the trustee of the Carers Share Plan will not give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to the rulee RMCs (including the applicant); and b. the ruling should be amended accordingly. 4. The respondent pay the applicant's costs on the basis provided for in the Test Case Funding Deed. 5. In the event of a dispute between the parties as to the amount of the costs payable under the Test Case Funding Deed, then the applicant shall, pursuant to the Federal Court Rules , be entitled to costs ascertained in accordance with the Test Case Funding Deed, and such costs can be taxed accordingly.

cited,Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No 13) [1995] FCA 626,"Peoplebank submits that the demands of justice require that the costs of the notice of motion be paid forthwith for the following reasons: 1. To prevent the frustration of prior Court orders. Peoplebank submits that the Court has made it clear to Cytel that the costs awarded to Peoplebank on 3 November 2006 must be paid, before Peoplebank is required to incur any further costs in this action. Peoplebank notes that the current costs order arises out of attempts by Peoplebank to secure this payment. 2. The application ought not to have been brought. Peoplebank submits that the notice of motion ought not to have been brought and that the application is devoid of merit. Peoplebank submits that ' propounding interlocutory applications of dubious merit is a relevant consideration in the exercise of the Court's discretion on costs '. In Life Airbag at 12 Branson J observed that the demands of justice may require a departure from the ordinary rule where a party has been required to incur significant costs over and above those it would have incurred had the opposing party acted with competence and diligence. Peoplebank says that this observation is apposite. 3. The end of the proceedings is still not in sight. Peoplebank: &#8226; notes that the proceedings are stayed until Cytel pays the amount of the 3 November 2006 costs order. &#8226; submits that the Court can infer that Cytel has no present intention to pay this debt and is aiming to postpone payment. &#8226; submits that the length of time until the proceedings can be concluded is a relevant factor in exercise of the Court's discretion ( Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No 13) [1995] FCA 626 at [4] [5]). 4. Costs granted by the current costs order are discrete. Peoplebank submits that it is a relevant factor that the current costs order relates to a discrete issue, separate from the principal proceedings. 5. No evidence that a 'forthwith order' will stifle the proceedings. Peoplebank submits that there is no evidence to support Cytel's claim that it will be 'further prejudiced in prosecuting its claim'."
referred to,Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770,"The first was the issue of performance risk. This is an issue which has been raised in a number of cases to which Mr Jackman referred. The most recent case is Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 at [23] . 6 I was satisfied that the ""performance risk"" was sufficiently addressed in relation to each of the Schemes for the reasons set out in the written submissions. 7 The second matter to which reference was made was an exclusivity provision contained in clause 19 of the Merger Implementation Agreement. This contained a ""no shop restriction"", a ""no talk restriction"" and a ""no due diligence restriction""."
cited,Markisic v Dept of Community Services of New South Wales &amp; Ors [2005] NSWSC 1373,"In my view, to the extent that this is a cause of action under ss 51AA and 52 (and in my view the relevance of s 51AA is dubious) it is not one in respect of which the applicant has suffered personal injury within the meaning of s 116(2)(g) Bankruptcy Act . This is because, notwithstanding the claim that the applicant has suffered personal injury: a. Other than a statement that the applicant suffered personal injury, no injury is particularised or connection drawn between how a failure to warn and advise the applicant caused the applicant to suffer personal injury. A bare allegation that the applicant has suffered personal injury or wrong, without particularising the injury or wrong, or without stating the connection between the conduct complained of and the claimed personal injury or wrong, is not adequate to provide the applicant with standing to pursue litigation in the very limited circumstances of his bankruptcy. Particularising the damage and establishing the nexus would be necessary in any event. As explained in well-known comments of Bowen LJ in Ratcliffe v Evans (1892) 2 QB 524 at 532: 'The necessity of alleging and proving actual temporal loss with certainty and precision in all cases of the sort has been insisted upon for centuries... In all actions accordingly on the case where the damage actually done is the gist of the action, the character of the acts themselves which produce the damage, and the circumstances under which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved. As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on, both in pleading and proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and to the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done. To insist upon less would be to relax old and intelligible principles. To insist upon more would be the vainest pedantry.' (note similar comments by Dillon LJ in Lonrho plc v Fayed (No 5) [1994] 1 All ER 188 at 194, Branson J in Kirela Pty Ltd v Westfield Holdings Ltd [2002] FCA 1223 at [15] , Ryan J in PFD Food Services Pty Ltd v NAFDA Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 682 at [18] - [19] , and Smart AJ in Markisic v Dept of Community Services of New South Wales &amp; Ors [2005] NSWSC 1373 at [115] ) b.

If the claim is to be categorised as a claim in negligence which has resulted in financial loss, it properly lies with the trustee in bankruptcy: Faulkner v Bluett . d. If the claim is to be categorised as a breach of fiduciary duty or trust it properly lies with the trustee in bankruptcy. As pointed out by RD Nicholson J in Pridmore v Magenta Nominees Pty Ltd (1999) 161 ALR 458 at 468: 'In relation to s 58(1)(a) 'the property of the bankrupt' as defined in par 116(1)(a) would include any choses in action which the applicants had to enforce equitable rights. Such rights, being property being divisible among the creditors of the bankrupt, would vest in the official trustee. If the equitable rights arose after the sequestration order it would for the same reasons be 'property that is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt' within s 58(6) and thus property to which s 58(1)(b) applies so that again the exercise of the rights would vest in the official trustee...' (note also Wily (as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Fuller) v Fuller [2000] FCA 1512 ; Pascoe, in the matter of Hudson [2006] FCA 785) e. If the claim is categorised as a breach of ss 51AA or 52 , it is claim with respect to a commercial transaction which has now vested in the trustee in bankruptcy."
discussed,Tallglen Pty Ltd v Pay TV Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 130,"The legal principles that govern the exercise of the Court's discretion under this rule have been discussed in a number of recent cases, and are well established: see Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 (' Bass' ) at 355-359; Tepko Pty Ltd v Water Board [2001] HCA 19 ; (2001) 206 CLR 1 (' Tepko' ) at 55; Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society (1999) 217 ALR 495 (' Reading' ) at 497-500 [7]-[11]; Direct Factory Outlets Homebush Pty Ltd v Property Council of Australia [2005] FCA 1002 ( 'Direct Factory Outlets' ) at [2]-[4]; Souflett Beheer v AWB Limited [2004] FCA 518 ( 'Souflett Beheer' ) at [19]-[20]; Kockums AB v Commonwealth [2002] FCAFC 138 at [38] - [41] ; SmithKline Beecham (Aust) Pty Ltd v Chipman [2002] FCA 674 (' SmithKline' ) at [35]-[39]; SPI Spirits (Cyprus) Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 14 (' Diageo' ) at [22]-[27]; Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97 ( 'Save the Ridge' ) at 103-104 [15]-[17]; Rainsford v Victoria [2005] FCAFC 163 ; (2005) 144 FCR 279 (' Rainsford' ) at 291-294 36-44; Director of Fisheries (NT) v Arnhem Land Aboriginal Land Trust [2001] FCA 98 ; (2001) 109 FCR 488 ( 'Director of Fisheries' ) at 521 [139] and 526-527 [163]; and Tallglen Pty Ltd v Pay TV Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 130 (' Tallglen' ) at 141-142. 29 The starting point must be that, as a general rule, all issues of fact and law should be determined at the one time: Reading at 497 [7]; Tallglen at 141-142; and Diageo at [23]. 36 In CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill [1985] 1 NSWLR 601 at 606, Kirby P said that a matter is 'ripe' for separate and preliminary determination where it is a central issue in contention between the parties, and its resolution will either obviate the necessity of litigation altogether or substantially narrow the field of controversy. This proposition assumes, of course, that the factual foundation for the determination of the issue has been resolved: see Rocklea Spinning Mills v Anti-Dumping Authority (1995) 56 FCR 406; and SmithKline at [35]-[39]. In Tallglen , Giles CJ in the Commercial Division said at 141-142 that in the ordinary course all issues in proceedings should be decided at the one time, but the separate decision of a question may be appropriate where, for example, the decision of a question is critical to the outcome of the proceedings and (at least if decided in one way) will bring the proceedings to an end. His Honour added that, in particular circumstances, the separate decision of a question may be appropriate even if it will not bring the proceedings to an end, such as where there is a strong prospect that the parties will agree upon the result when the core of the dispute is decided or where the decision will obviate unnecessary and expensive hearings of other questions. 38 The courts have repeatedly warned of the dangers that attend the trial of separate or preliminary questions. In Tepko at 55 [168]-[170], Kirby and Callinan JJ said that the attraction of trials of separate questions are often more chimerical than real; savings in time and expense can prove illusory and the process can generate other problems such as interlocutory appeals and consequent delays. Their Honours concluded that single issue trials should only be embarked upon when their utility, economy and fairness to the parties are beyond question: at 55 [170]. In Direct Factory Outlets , Sackville J said, quite correctly, that the dangers of separate trials are well illustrated by the numerous cases in which the process has miscarried. In Save the Ridge at 103 [15], Black CJ and Moore J said that the O 29 procedure is one that should be adopted with caution as it can be fraught with difficulties. In Tallglen at 141-142, Giles CJ said that the ordering of separate trials must be carefully controlled lest fragmentation of the proceedings (particularly when the exercise of rights of appeal is borne in mind) brings delay, expense and hardship greater than that which the making of the order was intended to avoid. Similar statements can be found in this Court: see eg Novartis Corp Protection Australasia Pty Ltd v Orica Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1013 at [7] per Stone J."
followed,Sheffield Oxford Controls Co Ltd [1979] ICR 396,"I do not discount the possibility that Mr Coulson asked Mr Hem to resign. I rather think that something along those lines was suggested. Having accused him of theft it would not be surprising had Mr Coulson asked Mr Hem to resign. By the time of the conversation the ill-will between the two was significant. If Mr Hem had been asked to resign to avoid a dismissal that would be equivalent to an actual dismissal. In Sheffield Oxford Controls Co Ltd [1979] ICR 396, in delivering the judgment of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Arnold J said (at 402): ""It is plain, we think, that there must exist a principle, exemplified by the four cases to which we have referred, that where an employee resigns and that resignation is determined upon him because he prefers to resign rather than be dismissed (the alternative having been expressed to him by the employer in the terms of a threat that if he does not resign he will be dismissed), the mechanics of the resignation do not cause that to be other than a dismissal. The cases do not in terms go further than that. We find the principle to be one of causation. In cases such as that which we have just hypothesised, and those reported, the causation is the threat. It is the existence of the threat which causes the employee to be willing to sign, and to sign, a resignation letter or be willing to give, and to give, the oral resignation. But where that willingness is brought about by other considerations and the actual causation of the resignation is no longer the threat which has been made but is the state of mind of the resigning employee, that he is willing and content to resign on the terms which he has negotiated and which are satisfactory to him, then we think there is no room for the principle to be derived from the decided cases."" 20 In the end it is not necessary for me to rule on any of the disputed aspects of the conversation between Mr Hem and Mr Coulson. The reason is that it is not in dispute that during the discussion Mr Hem was accused of being a thief. In the absence of any justification (and none was proffered) that accusation constitutes what in some cases is referred to as a ""constructive dismissal""."
discussed,Re Simring and High Court of Australia [2006] AATA 849 (2006) 44 AAR 103,"Loughnan has since been discussed in a couple of decisions of the Tribunal. In Re O'Sullivan and Family Court of Australia (1997) 47 ALD 765 , Senior Member Dwyer dealt with a case in which access was sought to the handwritten notes of a Family Court counsellor. In her reasons, the learned senior member discussed Loughnan in the context of determining whether the counsellor's notes were documents of the court. Having concluded that they were, at [25] the senior member found that the notes were not a document relating to matters of an administrative nature, because of the professional duties of the counsellor. It is unnecessary to decide in the present case whether that conclusion was correct. In Re Simring and High Court of Australia [2006] AATA 849 (2006) 44 AAR 103 , Deputy President Walker dealt with a request for access to a document created in the course of dealing with an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. The learned deputy president took the view that, because the document had been brought into existence within the chambers of a judge, as part of the judicial deliberative process, it was a judicial document, and not a document relating to matters of an administrative nature. The deputy president regarded Loughnan as not in point. At [19], the deputy president referred to the words ""relates to matters of an administrative nature"" in s 5 of the FOI Act in the following terms: The language used is relatively flexible and focuses on the general nature of the document rather than on the presence in the document of any administrative features whatever, however insignificant they might be in relation to the document's general nature. Even if the document in issue dealt incidentally with some administrative matters, and there is no evidence that it does, that would not necessarily detract from its overall quality as a document pertaining to the judicial role of the Court rather than to its administrative organisation."
considered,Hudson v Entsch [2005] FCA 557,"The Commission also points to Hudson v Entsch [2005] FCA 557 where Dowsett J considered Mr Hudson's opposition to a costs order being made against him on the basis that, inter alia, the matter involved a significant question of public interest. His Honour held that that submission was the most significant and meritorious of Mr Hudson's arguments (at [5]) but that: ...there is great potential danger in allowing individual members of the public to decide that particular issues are of public interest if that means that others must pay for the ensuing litigation. An individual should not be encouraged to think that he or she can litigate without the risk of an order for costs in the event that he or she is unsuccessful, merely because he or she considers that there is some aspect of public interest to be vindicated in the litigation. The question is whether the first respondent or the applicant should bear the first respondent's costs of these proceedings. The applicant started the proceedings; the first respondent had no choice in the matter and resisted them. I consider that the better outcome is that the applicant pay those costs. 14 Mr Smith does not rely solely on the question of public interest in relation to costs. However, the Commission submits that, as in Entsch , Mr Smith started the proceedings and the Commission had no choice but to contest them. Accordingly, the Commission says, the Court should make an order that Mr Smith pay its costs. 15 In response, Mr Smith submits that the evidence before the Tribunal, which was also requested by discovery in his petition, will show that it was the Commission that ' caused my allegation and petition '."
cited,Malleys Ltd v J W Tomlin Pty Limited [1961-62] 35 ALJR 352,"His Honour's Reasons reflect the following observations concerning his Honour's assessment of the evidence before him and the legal issues: (a) The Applicant applied for the Registered Design on 24 December 2001. The Registered Design was granted on 27 May 2003 and since September 2004 Midamarine has, through arrangements with a licensee, Britz Innovation Pty Ltd ('Britz Innovation') and a related company Kalinin Pty Ltd ('Kalinin'), a company trading as 'Britz Marketing', been selling an inflatable surfcraft described as the ' Wavestar '. The Applicant also sells another surfcraft article described as the ' Surfster '. (b) The Applicant contends that the Wavestar is an embodiment of the Registered Design. (c) In June 2005, Mr Russell Joel Binkin ('Mr Binkin'), 'an associate of the applicant, provided a sample of the Wavestar to Mr Corrick and endeavoured to persuade him that he should licence the design of the Wavestar from the applicant. Mr Corrick was provided with artwork, which came from the applicant. I am satisfied that the sample of the Wavestar and the artwork contained clear notification of a Registered Design, and the artwork and sample contained the Warning which presently appears on the physical exhibit of the Wavestar. It is to be expected, I would have thought, that there was copyright in somebody in that formulation of the Warning.' [6] (d) 'After the meeting and the supply of the sample and artwork, Mr Corrick indicated he was not interested in pursuing a licence for the product.' [7] (e) In January 2006, Midamarine and Britz Marketing entered into an exclusive distributorship in relation to the Wavestar surfcraft. In February 2006, Mr Corrick commenced negotiations with the National Rugby League ('NRL') and the Australian Football League ('AFL') to use the trade marks of NRL and AFL sporting teams on surfcraft or surf mats. (f) On 8 September 2006, a director of Midamarine, Mr Michael Arenson, learnt that DMC was supplying a surfcraft article to 'Amart All Sports' which was said by Mr Arenson to be strikingly similar to the Wavestar . (g) On 22 September 2006, Mr Arenson saw a reproduction of the DMC article. Mr Arenson spoke to Mr Corrick and wrote a letter to him on 24 September 2006 drawing his attention to the similarities in the design features between the Wavestar article and the DMC article. Mr Arenson drew Mr Corrick's attention to the fact that the warning label endorsed on the DMC article was a direct copy of the Warning Notice on the Wavestar article. In particular, Mr Arenson drew Mr Corrick's attention to the reproduction on the DMC article of the claim, 'The shape of this inflated product is a Registered Design' . (h) On 27 September 2006, the solicitors for DMC applied to register a design of a surfcraft in the name of DMC and, in that Application, Mr Corrick was described as the designer. His Honour observed that: 'No documents supporting his design exist, for the good reason that, in fact, the DMC product is a direct and complete copy of the Wavestar. ' [11] (i) His Honour noted: 'It is now conceded that the DMC surf mat is indeed a copy - and a deliberate copy of the Wavestar ' . This, in my view, had to be so. The visual comparison leads to that conclusion. The fact that the Wavestar was left with Mr Corrick, the comparison of the two and the identity of the words used in the Warning on the back of the DMC surf mat and, in particular, ""the shape of this inflatable product is a Registered Design"", lead inevitably to the conclusion that the DMC product is a direct copy of the Wavestar '. [12] 'The words on the Wavestar reflect the contention by Mr Arenson that the Wavestar is an embodiment of the Registered Design. The presence of those words on the DMC product is, in my opinion, damning evidence of copying by DMC of the Wavestar.' [13] (j) Counsel for DMC contended that the Wavestar is not an embodiment of the Registered Design and in any event, the Registered Design is invalid. As to the latter question, his Honour concluded that for interlocutory purposes, the Applicant is to be treated as the owner of a valid Registered Design having regard to differences in the features of shape reflected in the examples of prior art. 'Indeed, the attack on the validity of the Registered Design is seriously undermined by DMC's own application for registration of the design of the DMC product, which application is tainted with dishonesty and fraudulent claims. I accept that it has been acknowledged that the application will be withdrawn or otherwise expunged.' [16] (l) His Honour addressed Midamarine's contention that DMC had applied the Registered Design or a fraudulent or obvious imitation of the Registered Design to articles sold and offered for sale by DMC. At [23], the features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation contained within the Registered Design, capable of being judged by the eye, are identified by his Honour. At [24], his Honour observes, 'I have inspected the inflated DMC product and compared it with the Registered Design. The inflated DMC product possesses each of the features identified in the Applicant's written submissions (those identified at [23]), with the exception that the handles do not protrude from the top of the surf mat as depicted in the Registered Design. The handles on the Wavestar also do not protrude from the top of the surf mat, as depicted in the Registered Design. His Honour concluded that, 'For present purposes, being the interlocutory purposes, I am satisfied that, to the eye, the shape of the DMC product is substantially the same as that of the Registered Design. It is, in my opinion, strongly arguable that the design, which has been applied to the DMC product, is an obvious imitation of the Registered Design. That is, in the words of the test in Malleys (Malleys Ltd v J W Tomlin Pty Limited [1961-62] 35 ALJR 352) , to be found at p 354 of the report: ""Not the same but a copy apparent to the eye notwithstanding slight differences"".' [27] (m) His Honour observed that even if the design applied to the DMC article is not an obvious imitation of the Registered Design, the test for fraudulent imitation is even more strongly arguable [28]. His Honour identified the tests approved by the High Court in Polyaire Pty Ltd v K-Aire Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287 and the High Court's approval of the observations of Lehane J in Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV &amp; Anor v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 816 ; (1999) 91 FCR 167. His Honour concluded: 'I am satisfied that there is a strongly arguable case of fraudulent imitation. It seems inevitable that, if the Wavestar is an embodiment of the Registered Design, then the DMC product is a fraudulent imitation. The design of the Wavestar and the DMC product is almost identical. It could not have been independently created. It is now admitted that the DMC product is a copy of the Wavestar .' [31] 'So, also, is the embarrassing identity of the direct words of the warning label, including the imprinting of the words: ""The shape of this inflatable product is a Registered Design"". ' (n) At [33], his Honour said this: 'It is not denied that Mr Corrick was supplied with a sample of the Wavestar surf mat and had discussed obtaining a licence of the design. It seems plain that there is a strongly arguable case of obvious imitation or fraudulent imitation of the Registered Design.' (o) On the question of the balance of convenience, his Honour considered the observations of the High Court in Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Limited [1968] HCA 1 ; (1967-68) 118 CLR 618 at 625 and the principles affirmed by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 and weighed in the balance the implications arising out of a consideration that DMC had 'in the face of warnings' from Midamarine and 'with eyes wide open' embarked upon a course of importing, selling and offering for sale articles to which a fraudulent or obvious imitation of the Registered Design had been applied. At [39], his Honour said this: 'In my judgment, the balance of convenience strongly favours the grant of the injunction sought. The chronology of events, and in particular the history of the design of the DMC product that is to say no design, but a direct copy indicates that the respondents have decided to import and distribute the DMC product with their eyes open to the likely consequences of so doing.' (p) At [40], his Honour further referred to submissions by counsel for Midamarine and quoted this submission, 'No reasonable trader, having received the sales pitch from Mr Binkin [in June 2005] for the Wavestar , could reasonably ignore the existence of the rights [claimed in the design]' . (The words in the square brackets are explanatory words inserted into counsel's submission by his Honour). (q) As to the question of damage accruing to Midamarine, his Honour said this: 'In this particular case, the applicant is shown to be an established manufacturer and supplier of the Wavestar surf mats. It is strongly arguable that that product has the benefit of the protection of the Registered Design. It has been creating a market for its product and supplying its product to distributors since 2004. [35]. 'Earlier this year, the applicant entered into an exclusive distributor arrangement with Britz Marketing. I accept that its fortunes are tied to its ability to distribute its products via Britz Marketing. The Wavestar is now exclusively sold by Britz Marketing under the name Wahu Wavetube . That surf mat is sold in an extensive range of shops, including Toyworld, Big W, Rebel Sports, Target and Toy'R'Us. Mr Britz says the Wahu Wavetube has been heavily promoted'. [36] 'Since the First Respondent [DMC] began, in October 2006, to sell the DMC product, Amart All Sports has ceased all sales of the Wahu Wavetube and has acquired, instead, the DMC product. I accept that the inability to sell surf mats to the applicant's design to Amart has a significant impact on the ability of the applicant to make sales.' (r) On the question of an assessment of potential wider injury, his Honour concluded that, 'There is a serious over-statement of those risks in the evidence on behalf of the applicant'. [38] His Honour concluded that there was 'a deal of exaggeration in the injury inherent' in the contentions of Mr Britz that Britz Marketing would have to give serious consideration to sourcing surf mats from a different and cheaper source than Midamarine if DMC products continued to be sold. (s) At [41], his Honour reached this conclusionary observation, 'The strength of the applicant's case of deliberate copying by the first respondent favours the grant of the interlocutory injunction. The impugned DMC products are clearly and objectively a deliberate copy of the Wavestar . The person responsible for the design and manufacturer of the DMC product knew that the product was a copy of the Wavestar , and knew of the claim that the design of the Wavestar product was protected by a Registered Design. In those circumstances, it seems to me that DMC has embarked on a task of ordering and importing the impugned products with its eyes wide open as to the potential consequences of so doing, namely, that it will be exposed to the present application.'"

Those who were named in the brochure as organisations, rather than particular identified corporate identities, included the hotel operator, as ""Pacific International"", and a developer, ""Austcorp"". Ordinarily, a statement which involves the state of mind of the maker will convey the meaning expressly, or by implication, that the maker of the statement had a particular state of mind when it was made and, commonly, that there was a basis for that state of mind: Global Sportsman Pty Limited v Mirror Newspapers Limited [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ; RAIA Insurance Brokers Limited v FAI General Insurance Co Limited [1993] FCA 92 ; (1993) 41 FCR 164 at 172-175 per Beaumont and Spender JJ, with whom Davies J generally agreed at 165-166."

referred to,Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society [1999] FCA 718 ; (1999) 217 ALR 495,"was referred to a number of authorities, but I do not need to go through them in detail.

They were applied by Kenny J in Fleming's Nurseries Pty Ltd v Hannaford [2008] FCA 591. Orders separating liability from damages or an account of profits are often made in intellectual property cases. In Liberty Financial Pty Ltd v Scott [2003] FCA 226 at [40] , Weinberg J expressed the view that intellectual property cases, or at least intellectual property cases other than patent cases, should be treated no differently from other commercial cases. I do not need to enter that debate because this is not an intellectual property case. The claims made by the applicant include claims made under the Corporations Act and the TPA. In any event, there is no fixed and invariable rule that an order for the determination of separate questions will be made in intellectual property cases."

cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Shell Co of Australia Ltd (1999) 161 ALR 686,"In the present case senior counsel for Multiplex cited a line of cases which hold that a subpoena duces tecum is not to be used as a substitute for discovery: Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Shell Co of Australia Ltd (1999) 161 ALR 686, Pasini v Vanstone [1999] FCA 1271. However, all these cases were concerned with subpoenas directed to a party. True it is that in Hughes (at 543) Toohey J, citing Small , said that a party may not though a subpoena ""obtain discovery from a stranger to the action"". But what was meant by obtaining discovery from a stranger emerges from the judgment of Jordan CJ in Small at 573: ""If [a subpoena duces tecum ] be addressed to a stranger, it must specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced. A subpoena duces tecum ought not to be issued to such a person requiring him to search for and produce all such documents as he may have in his possession or power relating to a particular subject matter. It is not legitimate to use a subpoena for the purpose of endeavouring to obtain what would be in effect discovery of documents against a person who, being a stranger, is not liable to make discovery. A stranger to the cause ought not to be required to go to trouble and perhaps to expense in ransacking his records and endeavouring to form a judgment as to whether any of his papers throw light on a dispute which is to be litigated upon issues of which he is presumably ignorant"". 27 The caution that courts have exercised where parties seek to obtain documents by subpoena from other parties is influenced by the principle that a particular procedure has been prescribed for obtaining such documents, namely discovery: Shell Co at [50]. With non-parties, however, the position is reversed. In recent times the introduction of O 15A r 8 has allowed discovery from non-parties, but it is a jurisdiction which ""should be exercised with caution"" and is not intended ""for the general run of case"": McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 785 at [33]. So for the obtaining of documents from a non-party such as ASIC, subpoena duces tecum is the norm rather than the exception."
applied,Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404,"an objection to the production of documents in answer to a subpoena is based upon a claim of public interest immunity, the usual practice&#8212;established many years ago&#8212;has been for the grounds of the claim to be set out and explained in an affidavit made by either the Minister who is the political head of the particular department concerned or the Secretary of that department ( Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 43). The weight to be afforded to that affidavit is governed to some degree by the extent of the knowledge which the deponent possesses concerning the documents which are the subject of the claim ( Sankey v Whitlam 142 CLR at 44). The knowledge of those documents which must be considered comprises not only knowledge of the contents of the documents but also knowledge of the circumstances in which they came into existence. When the claim is based partly or wholly on national security grounds, very considerable weight must be given to the views of the responsible Minister or the permanent head. In the present case, because we live in dangerous times and matters of national security are at the forefront of the ONA's responsibilities, very considerable weight must be given to the views of the Director-General expressed, as they were, on his oath ( Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 435). Claims of public interest immunity require the Court to decide whether the administration of justice will be impaired or perhaps even frustrated by the withholding of relevant evidence in favour of a greater public interest, namely, that harm shall not be done to the nation or the Public Service by the disclosure of the material in contest ( Conway v Rimmer [1968] UKHL 2 ; [1968] AC 910 at 940; Rogers v Home Department State Secretary [1973] AC 388 at 400; 406 407; Sankey v Whitlam 142 CLR at 38 39; 60; and 94; Alister v The Queen 154 CLR 404 at 412; and 434; and Commonwealth v Northern Land Council [1993] HCA 24 ; (1993) 176 CLR 604 at 616 617)."
cited,Moss v Fantil Pty Ltd t/as Central Coast Security Services (1994) 58 IR 118 ,"Early in the history of these provisions it was established that they could not be used to restrict genuine business decisions by an employer, notwithstanding that the objective of the provisions then was the protection of unions and collective action ( Connington v Municipality of Kogarah [1913] AR (NSW) 40 at 44; Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46 at 49; Klanjscek v Silver (1961) 4 FLR 182 at 187; Moss v Fantil Pty Ltd t/as Central Coast Security Services (1994) 58 IR 118 at 127). The underlying principle is that a decision that may affect an employee or a class of employee does not discriminate against or victimise that employee or those employees if it is taken for a sound business reason. This principle has been applied in various situations in more recent times in considering a prohibited reason within the meaning of s 793 and similar provisions.

discussed,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 609 ,"In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 609 , Finkelstein J said at [7] that the proper approach is that access should be allowed unless the interests of justice require a different course. His Honour went on to say that there is a strong presumption in favour of allowing any member of the public who wishes to do so to inspect any document or thing that is put into evidence. 34 It is true that in ACCC v ABB Finkelstein J expressed the principle in terms which reflect Dr Bell's submission. It is also true that Sackville J has expressed his agreement with the passage of the judgment; Seven Network at [25]; see also Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2006] FCA 606 at [14] . But in my opinion, Seven Network and other relevant authorities do not establish a rule that there must be exceptional circumstances for an application to be refused. 40 ACCC v ABB is the only Australian authority to which I have referred in which access was granted to a non-party who was not a media organisation. The applicant was a non-party who sought access to a statement of agreed facts and joint submissions of the parties in proceedings brought by the Commission against a company and its executives for civil penalties for contravention of s 45 of the Trade Practices Act 1 974 (Cth): see ACCC v ABB at [1]. The applicant sought access to those documents to determine whether it should bring an action to recover losses suffered as a consequence of the admitted breaches. 41 The extension of the principle of open justice to those circumstances is perfectly understandable. The Commission's proceedings were brought in the public interest and parties affected by the contravention ought to be given access to determine whether a private action for damages caused by the contravention would be justified. The documents sought were confined in nature. The applicant did not seek to trawl willy-nilly through the court file. 42 The question of whether access should be granted to Merlin arises in different circumstances. The authorities to which I have referred indicate, in my view, that the discretion is one to be exercised in the interests of justice, having regard to all the circumstances. 43 Where leave is sought to inspect documents that have not been read in open court, or at least tendered in evidence and considered by the judge as evidence or submission, the rule in my opinion is that leave will ordinarily be refused to inspect that material. This approach is consistent with that suggested by Sackville J in Macquarie Radio Network Pty Ltd v ABA [2002] FCA 1408 at [21] ; cf. ACCC v ABB at [6]. 44 It is true, as Finkelstein J said in ACCC v ABB at [6] that O 46 r 6(3) does not distinguish between documents that have been admitted into evidence and those which have not. But as Santow J observed in eisa Ltd v Brady [2000] NSWSC 929 , there is a risk of serious injustice if untested allegations can be published to the world at large: cited in Macquarie Radio Network at [21]. 64 Here, the application is not made in furtherance of the principle of open justice. It uses, as a springboard, the corollary to which Moore-Bick J referred in Dian , namely that persons present during a court hearing may learn of information they can use to their advantage. But in truth it goes further because it seeks ""access to justice"" based upon the modern approach to commercial litigation with its emphasis upon creation, and preservation of large volumes of written material, much of which is not read out in open court. Finkelstein J referred to this in ACCC v ABB at [4] [5]."

cited,Hamod v State of New South Wales [2002] FCAFC 97 (2002) 188 ALR 659,"There is no doubt that the Court has power to order indemnity costs, or costs assessed on a basis lying somewhere between indemnity costs and party-party costs, in an appropriate case. It must be recognised that an appropriate case will only be one in which the circumstances justify the Court in departing from the usual rule that costs awarded will be calculated on a party-party basis. It is impossible to provide a comprehensive definition of what is an appropriate case. In Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234, Sheppard J set out principles that his Honour derived from the authorities. Those principles are summarised in the judgment of the Full Court in Hamod v State of New South Wales [2002] FCAFC 97 (2002) 188 ALR 659 at [20] : Indemnity costs are not designed to punish a party for persisting with a case that turns out to fail. They are not awarded as a means of deterring litigants from putting forward arguments that might be attended by uncertainty. Rather, they serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred, as a normal costs order could not be expected to do, when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs."
cited,Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 ; (2003) 216 CLR 515,"argument for Naturalcare in tort commenced with the contention that, at least between 1995 and 2002, Pan made a number of representations to Naturalcare to the effect that Pan was ready, willing and able to continue to supply Naturalcare with therapeutic goods; that any risk to Naturalcare arising out of Naturalcare's reliance or dependence upon Pan for the supply of product was negligible or immaterial and that Pan was, and would continue to be, compliant with the requirements of the TGA. For the purposes of argument, that can be taken as a fair summary of the statements by Selim from time to time and from the dealings between the parties over many years. The following propositions were advanced: (1) The representations were made in circumstances in which Pan knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the representations would be relied upon (referring to L Shaddock &amp; Associates Proprietary Limited v Council of the City of Parramatta [1981] HCA 59 ; (1981) 150 CLR 225; Mid Density Developments Pty Limited v Rockdale Municipal Council (1993) 44 FCR 290; Eade v Vogiazopoulos [1999] 3 VR 889 at [115] per Smith J; Perre v Apand Pty Limited [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 per McHugh J at [124]). (2) Naturalcare was vulnerable to Pan in the sense that it was unable to protect its own interests. Pan was in control of its own manufacturing processes and, to the extent that Naturalcare might have taken steps to protect its own interests, it was induced not to do so by Pan's express representations and conduct (referring to Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 ; (2003) 216 CLR 515 at [23] ; Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [10] [13] per Gleeson CJ; at [42] per Gaudron J; at [118] [119] per McHugh J; at [216] per Gummow J; at [298] per Kirby J; at [416] per Callinan J; Fortuna Seafoods Pty Ltd (as trustee for the Rowley Family Trust) v Ship 'Eternal Wind' [2005] QCA 405). (3) Pan had actual foresight of the likelihood that Naturalcare could suffer harm in the event that it manufactured and supplied product otherwise than conformably with requirements of the TGA and the Code. Pan was supplying goods for sale to, and ingestion by, humans. Pan knew that Naturalcare was taking the lion's share of its products from Pan and would be damaged if that supply ceased ( Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [13] per Gleeson CJ; at [50]; and [133] per McHugh J). (4) The statutory scheme meant that Pan assumed, for its own advantage, particular responsibilities which would give comfort to sponsors in the circumstances of Naturalcare ( Moorabool Shire Council v Taitapanui [2006] VSCA 30 at [3] , [82], [159]). (5) The case falls within at least one of the standard categories in which the common law has previously recognised that a duty of care may arise, namely, the negligent supply of goods ( Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [96] per McHugh J). (6) The policy consideration relating to indeterminacy of liability does not arise in the present case. Naturalcare was a first line victim. (7) Imposing a duty of care of the kind alleged would not impose an unreasonable burden on Pan ( Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [133] per McHugh J). Taking these factors into account, it was submitted that Pan had a duty of care at least to take reasonable care to ensure that the goods it manufactured for supply conformed with the requirements of the TGA and the Code. Counsel for Pan has put forward a number of detailed reasons for its contention that the claim is misconceived. The most important is that Naturalcare was not 'vulnerable' in the sense required if that quality is to be a touchstone of liability as was submitted on behalf of Naturalcare. It would be necessary for Naturalcare to establish that it could not protect itself from the consequences of Pan's want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of the loss on the other party ( Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd at [23] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ; and Perre v Apand Pty Ltd per McHugh J at [120]). The risk of a supplier of goods not being able to maintain supply is an every day incident of commercial life. Many statutes regulate manufacturers and suppliers of goods. There is always a risk that if the statute is not complied with, the supply of goods may be prohibited or suspended. Various strategies to minimise risks of that kind and their impact are available to the intending purchaser. Particular contractual provisions can be framed, insurance can be sought, alternative suppliers located and so on. All available strategies were open to Naturalcare. The answer given on behalf of Naturalcare is that it was convinced by Selim's assurances not to take such prudent steps. That is no answer. It highlights the fact that the real complaint is about the alleged representations, not about failure to take reasonable care to ensure that the requirements of the Code were met."
applied,Chan v MIMA [2001] AATA 487,"It is necessary to consider Emmet Js judgment in Chan in some detail, as well as the reasons for decision of Deputy President Purvis QC in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from whose decision the appeal was made to the Federal Court by the Minister: Chan v MIMA [2001] AATA 487. Mrs Wai Kuen Chan did not appear on the appeal. 164 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, on 26 February 2001, cancelled the applicant's class UC (temporary business entry) sub class 457 visa on the basis that the respondent Minister was not satisfied that the applicant passed the character test, pursuant to s 501(6) of the Migration Act . Deputy President Purvis said, at [3]: The issues that arise for determination in this application are: (a) Whether there is or has been a relevant association between the Applicant and her ex husband Mr Wong Kam Fei. (b) if the answer to (a) is in the affirmative whether, the Tribunal reasonably suspects that Mr Wong has been or is involved in criminal conduct. (c) if the answers to (a) and (b) above are both in the affirmative and the applicant thereby does not satisfy the character test, whether the Tribunal should or should not exercise its discretion to cancel the Applicant's visa. 165 Deputy President Purvis, at [10], referred to paragraph 1.5 of Direction Number 17, the forerunner to Direction Number 21, which replaced it. The paragraphs in each Direction are identical: The meaning of ""association"" for the purposes of the Character Test encompasses a very wide range of relationships including having an ""alliance"" or a ""link"" or ""connection"" with a person, a group or an organised body that is involved in criminal activities. ""Association"" does not require actual membership of a group or an organised body that is involved in criminal activities. In establishing criminal association, the decision-maker may have regard to the following: (a) the degree and frequency of association the non-citizen had or has with the individual group or organisation; (b) the duration of the association; and (c) the nature of the association. 209 A professional association, whether as a doctor, lawyer, social worker, or teacher, would be within the respondent's construction of the association test. A mere familial or social association would be enough. So much is implicit in Emmet J's rejection of the view of the Tribunal that the association by way of family ties, summarised by Emmett J in [7] of his reasons, was sufficient to ground the relevant association."

His Honour referred to the decisions of the Full Court in SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 ; (2008) 168 FCR 256 and SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 119 ; (2008) 170 FCR 236. His Honour concluded that the case before him could be distinguished from SZKCQ because ' here the information provided by the DFAT was crystal clear, and the basis upon which it had been obtained, namely the letter from the editor of the newspaper, was provided to the applicant. There is nothing more that the applicant could have gained from knowing what questions were asked of the editor by DFAT '. His Honour held that the s 424A letters complied with that section. His Honour's reasons indicate that he did not consider that s 424 of the Act applied to the information obtained by DFAT. Even if there had been a breach of s 424 , it is apparent from his Honour's reasons that he understood that the provision of the letters from the Tribunal to the appellant complied with obligations to afford procedural fairness. It followed that relief should be refused ( SZBYR v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [29] ). To the extent that this ground of appeal may be referring to evidence given by the appellant's wife to the Tribunal, that has not been raised by the appellant. In any event, none of the evidence given by the appellant's wife could be said to constitute ""information"" that the Tribunal considered would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision that was under review, the delegate's decision to reject the appellant's claims. The Tribunal merely found that it did not accept her claims and that she ' was prepared to fabricate her evidence in order to support the [appellant]'. The Tribunal's thought processes and appraisals of the evidence of the appellant's wife do not constitute information for the purposes of s 424A ( SZBYR at [18]). Ground 3 s 425 of the Act This ground of appeal relates to the provision of the DFAT documents to the appellant after the oral hearing. The appellant contends that he should then have been invited to a further oral hearing to give evidence on the issue of whether the documents he submitted to the Tribunal were fraudulent."
cited,"Hanover Shoe, Inc. v United Machinery Corp [1968] USSC 185 ; 392 US 481 (1968)","United States anti-trust jurisprudence denies a passing on defence to respondents who have dealt directly with applicants. On the other hand, it has been held that indirect purchasers of goods and services have no standing to sue for damages for anti-trust breaches under federal anti-trust law save for some immaterial exceptions: see Hanover Shoe, Inc. v United Machinery Corp [1968] USSC 185 ; 392 US 481 (1968); Illinois Brick Company v Illinois [1977] USSC 168 ; 431 US 720 (1977). The passing on defence is not available to those who have dealt directly with an applicant for a variety of reasons. They include the difficulty in analysing price and output decisions in the ""real economic world"" and the evidentiary complexities and uncertainties involved in analysing the impact of an overcharge on a firm's profits. The refusal to grant standing to indirect purchasers is justified on the ground that a respondent should not be exposed to multiple liability and double recovery in respect of the same conduct."
considered,SZAXY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 76,"SZAXY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 76 at [11] , Wilcox J observed: Views may sometimes differ as to whether a particular procedural step ought to be taken in the conduct of a review. The fact that the Court might have formed a different opinion to the Tribunal member in relation to a procedural decision does not in itself demonstrate lack of good faith by the Tribunal. His Honour's observation was made in the context of a challenge on the administrative law error ground of bad faith, but it might equally well have been made to like effect in respect of any challenge on the basis of unreasonableness to a procedural decision made by the Tribunal. It is not impossible to conceive of a case whereby an unreasonable decision in respect of a matter of procedure on the part of the Tribunal might, for example, violate the obligation found in s 425(1) , to invite a visa applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. Equally, it is not impossible to see how an unreasonable allowance of time to respond to a request under s 424A or the provision of information in response to an invitation given by the Tribunal might violate the requirements of that section. ""Unreasonableness"" here though would have to be of the order that no reasonable Tribunal in the circumstances could have made the particular procedural decision which it did. The decision would have to be to adopt an adjective appropriately put forward on behalf of the Minister: ""capricious"". That is not this case in respect of the circumstances attending the making of the Tribunal's decision, as the learned Federal Magistrate plainly appreciated. It is evident that the Tribunal considered on the merits and made value judgments reasonably open in respect of each procedural event which occurred between the filing of the review application and the making of the final decision. One of the earlier procedural events concerned whether the Appellant was then not just physically but also mentally able to attend and give evidence and present his case at a hearing. The Tribunal took the initiative of inviting the Appellant to attend upon a specialist psychiatrist for the purpose of a report being furnished concerning his then state of health and wellbeing. This the Tribunal was entitled to do. The Tribunal then acted on the strength of the report given in making an earlier procedural value judgment. Again, the Tribunal was entitled to act upon such information. As the learned Federal Magistrate remarked at para 11, Dr Walker (the psychiatrist concerned) provided that opinion and as a result the Tribunal put off a hearing for a very considerable period of time: As I have already noted, after April 2008 the applicant no longer made any complaints of a psychological nature. The Tribunal certainly did not prevent the applicant from finding his own doctor. It merely noted: ""He was indigent and would have difficulty in so doing."" The learned Federal Magistrate observed prosaically but not inaccurately that: This tribunal bent over backwards to assist the applicant and give him extensions of time for a period of over a year from June 2007 when he lodged his application to July 2008 when the last hearing was scheduled. I respectfully agree with those observations."
distinguished,R v Portus; Ex parte ANZ Banking Group Ltd [1972] HCA 57 ; (1972) 127 CLR 353,"In Electrolux , the High Court affirmed the line of authority consisting of R v Portus; Ex parte ANZ Banking Group Ltd [1972] HCA 57 ; (1972) 127 CLR 353 and Re Alcan Australia Ltd; Ex parte Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees [1994] HCA 34 ; (1994) 181 CLR 96. Each of those cases involved claims made by unions which, if acceded to by employers, would have obliged the employers to deduct from wages earned by their employees amounts by way of union dues, and to pay those amounts to the relevant union. In each case, it was held that such claims did not pertain to the relationship between employers and employees in their capacity as such. In Alcan , the High Court was invited to overturn Portus , but declined to do so. The claims in question in Portus and Alcan had both the first and second characteristics of the provisions in question in Electrolux . 116 Clauses 45 and 46 and the related provisions of EBA6 are of a very different character from the provisions that were the subject of Electrolux . They involve none of the three significant characteristics of the provisions the subject of Electrolux . There is no obligation on Qantas to deduct money from wages or salary that would otherwise be paid to any of its employees, or to pay any amount so deducted to any party other than Qantas. AIPA is not the intended recipient of any money from Qantas. The provisions in question in this case bind Qantas in relation to its existing employees, particularly those who are already members of AIPA. The provisions bear no resemblance to those that were the subject of Portus or Alcan . Any debts created by cll 45 and 46 and the related provisions of EBA6 are debts due from Qantas to its own existing employees, and relate to the relationship between Qantas and its own employees. The provisions do more than simply strengthen the position of AIPA, although they are certainly intended to accomplish that. They accomplish it by regulating the hours of work of Qantas's employees and the amounts of money to be paid to those employees. No question of deduction of any money from anything that would otherwise be paid to an employee arises. No agency relationship between AIPA and Qantas could possibly be created. There is no question of payment by any non-member to AIPA."
followed,"Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; (2002) 116 FCR 348","In Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; (2002) 116 FCR 348 ( Chamberlain ), Kiefel J addressed at some length the question of the circumstances that might be ""special"" within s 1184K. In particular, her Honour reviewed earlier cases and noted (at [32]) that two of them, Kertland v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [1999] FCA 1596 ; (1999) 95 FCR 64 and Secretary, Department of Social Security v Smith (1991) 30 FCR 56, were ""unusual"" in that in them ""it could be seen, objectively, that there could not have been a double payment"", so that ""it might be concluded that the statutory assumption operated unjustly"". Her Honour thought that that situation would not often arise and set those cases apart from the usual. 69 In Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; 116 FCR 348 itself, the effect of the statutory formula was that the applicant would have to pay back more than twice the amount that had been allocated to loss of earnings and of earning capacity in her lump sum settlement. Nonetheless, her Honour thought that such a factor would be present in many cases and was simply an aspect of the outworking of the formula. Her Honour considered that it could not, by itself, amount to ""special circumstances"". 70 Like Mr Clark, Mrs Chamberlain was elderly. She was aged 60 years when, on 13 January 1999, she suffered personal injury in a motor vehicle accident. At the time she was in receipt of an age pension and she had previously received a disability support pension. She claimed to have been able and entitled to earn up to $50 per week from teaching music, without her pension entitlement being affected. Her claim was settled for $35,000 plus $4,000 for costs. The parties to the settlement allocated $31,500 to pain and suffering and medical expenses, and $3,500 to loss of earnings and of earning capacity. 71 Mrs Chamberlain had continued to receive the age pension from the time of the accident. At that time, it was ss 1165 and 1166 of the SS Act that provided for the lump sum preclusion period and refund in Mrs Chamberlain's case, and s 1184 of the SS Act that provided for a discretion in the Secretary to treat the whole or part of a compensation payment as not having been made or not liable to be made if the Secretary should think it appropriate to do so ""in the special circumstances of the case"". Under s 17(3)(a) , the compensation part of the LSP was $17,500. The preclusion period was arrived at by dividing that sum by $422.90, giving a period of 41 weeks. The period ran from the date of the injury, 13 January 1999, to 26 October 1999. The statutory formula produced the result that in respect of that period, Mrs Chamberlain was liable to pay to the Commonwealth $7,643.36 more than twice the sum of $3,500 mentioned above. 72 Kiefel J stated (at [34] [35]): [34] The basis for the Tribunal's view [that ""special circumstances"" were established] was its acceptance of what the parties to the settlement said had been offered and accepted for the economic loss component. It was far less than the statute assumed to be the case in applying the formulae. Again, however, this will be so in many, if not most, cases to which the Act applies. Further, the extent of the difference from the basis upon which the parties acted could not provide the necessary ""special circumstance"". The statute has selected a figure which may operate in an arbitrary way. [35] The statutory objectives in utilising the formulae, referred to above, must also be borne in mind. It is not intended that a decision-maker be required to consider contentions about what part of the compensation reflected the economic loss component. That is so whether one has regard to the application of the formulae or the discretion under s 1184. The latter does not alter the objective and must be read in light of it. 73 Her Honour set aside the Tribunal's decision. 74 If Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; 116 FCR 348 is to be followed, the present application must be dismissed. 75 I respectfully agree with the approach that was taken by Kiefel J. The expression ""special circumstances"" in s 1184K does not embrace the circumstance that the 50 percent rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive, even grossly excessive, having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity, to the age of the injured person, and perhaps to other circumstances. 76 Once one embarks on an inquiry of the kind that would be required in such a case, one is defeating the legislative intention. The Parliament must be taken to have contemplated as ""usual"" or ""ordinary"" the circumstances of people placed as Mr Clark is. In effect, by adopting the rough and ready 50 percent rule, the legislature has faced such people with a choice: not sue at all and to rely, instead, on such other entitlements as may be available; litigate to trial so that the Court will identify a figure for loss of earnings and of earning capacity; or settle subject to the operation of the 50 percent rule. 77 In the present case, Mr Clark must be taken to have decided against the former two courses. I do not know why he did so. In one sense, it seems unfair that Mr Clark should suffer a preclusion period until 15 February 2008, but I do not think that this constitutes ""special circumstances"" in the light of the legislative intention. 78 If the position were otherwise, the r&eacute;gime that was introduced in 1988 would be defeated because it would be again open to parties to a settlement to attribute an artificially low figure to loss of earnings and earning capacity, and to the injured person, through s 1184K of the SS Act, to initiate the very kind of investigation that it was the intention of the 1988 amending Act to eliminate. 79 For the above reasons, I do not think that the AAT erred in law in failing to exercise the discretion given by s 1184K of the SS Act."

followed,BHP Petroleum (Timor Sea) Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources (1994) 49 FCR 155,"The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum (Timor Sea) Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources (1994) 49 FCR 155 ( BHP Petroleum ) and Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415 ; (2003) 128 FCR 564 ( Watson ) on the one hand, and cases such as Murry ; Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 ( Hope ), and Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 ( Ferguson ) on the other. 32 The decisions of BHP Petroleum and Watson also, in my view, do not support the contrast between the two expressions in s 35. 33 BHP Petroleum concerned the eligibility of certain taxpayers under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 (Cth) to have their projects combined so that expenditure on one of the combined projects could be set off against revenue from another. Section 20 empowered the Minister to ""... issue a combination certificate"" if satisfied, having regard to specified factors, that the projects ""are sufficiently related to be treated for the purposes of this Act as a single petroleum project"". The application for the ""combination certificate"" had to be made ""from"" a person or persons who were together entitled to at least half of the receipts from the sale of marketable petroleum commodities produced in relation to each of the projects. The formal application, by oversight, omitted the name of one intended applicant whose entitlement was necessary to meet the one half eligibility criterion. In the circumstances, the Court (Beaumont, Jenkinson and Heerey JJ) found that the application had in fact been made by all the intended applicants, so that criterion was satisfied. Beaumont J at 170-171 explained that the word ""from"" had its ordinary meaning as indicating ""the starting point, source or origin"" of the application. That source had been clearly exposed by other communications. I do not, however, see any observations in the reasons which support the claimed contrast between ""business activity"" and ""business"". However, I think the meaning of the word ""from"" as discussed is equally applicable to that word in the phrase ""from the business activity"". 49 The relevant distinction which is drawn by s 35 is between assessable income from the business activity in a particular year and assessable income which is not from the business activity in a particular year. Income from a business activity must clearly have a connection with it. Beaumont J (with whom Jenkinson and Heerey JHJ agreed) in BHP Petroleum at 170-171 applied the normal sense of a starting point, source or origin. Finn J in Watson at 569 contrasted income from the business of Mr Watson and income that was a surrogate or replacement for income which might otherwise have been received. As noted above, such income may include income from incidental activities even though they are not, or not likely to be, recurrent (eg the interest on a temporary cash surplus, as in Kidston ; or the proceeds of a life insurance policy, as in Carapark ; or the cash incentive paid to take a long term lease, as in Lees and Leech . In certain circumstances, and in relation to a particular period, the assessable income of a business activity might also include for a time disability payments under a personal income protection policy. I do not need to decide that question."

cited,Comcare Australia v Lees (1957) 151 ALR 647,"introduction of the requirement that administrative decision-makers provide reasons for their decisions (or do so on request from persons affected by those decisions) was a fundamental development in Australia's system of administrative law. In his 1989 Blackburn Lecture, the then Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, said that the creation of the obligation to provide a statement of reasons for decisions ""was a dramatic advance in arming the individual with effective remedies in the overall scheme to ensure administrative justice"" and that ""reasoned and principled administrative decisions are an indispensable element in a modern democracy."" The provision of reasons serves a number of useful functions: see Osmond v Public Service Board of New South Wales [1984] 3 NSWLR 447 at 463 (per Kirby P); Comcare Australia v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647 at 656 (per Finkelstein J). Relevantly, the provision of reasons enables the parties, and, particularly, unsuccessful parties, to understand why the decision was made and to make an informed judgment as to whether to seek redress or to accept the decision. To this end ""[i]t is necessary that the statement be sufficiently explicit to enable the recipient to determine whether ""the making of the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment"", ""the decision involved in error of law"", the decision-maker took into account an irrelevant consideration or failed to take into account a relevant consideration and like matters referred to in ss 5 and 6 of the [ADJR] Act"": Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487 at 490. In a frequently quoted passage from his judgment in Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Wraith [1983] FCA 179 ; (1983) 48 ALR 500 at 507, Woodward J explained the obligation, imposed on decision-makers by s 13 of the ADJR Act, as follows: ""The passages from judgments which are conveniently brought together in Re Palmer and Minister for the Capital Territory (1978) 23 ALR 176 at 206-207; 1 ALD 183 at 193-4, serve to confirm my view that s 13(1) of the Judicial Review Act requires the decision-maker to explain his decision in a way which will enable a person aggrieved to say, in effect: ""Even though I may not agree with it, I now understand why the decision went against me. I am now in a position to decide whether that decision has involved an unwarranted finding of fact, or an error of law, which is worth challenging."" This requires that the decision-maker should set out his understanding of the relevant law, any findings of fact on which his conclusions depend (especially if those facts have been in dispute), and the reasoning processes which led him to those conclusions. He should do so in clear and unambiguous language, not in vague generalities or the formal language of legislation.""

Mr Prince of Counsel accepted that referral and appeared as pro bono counsel for the Appellant. The Court is indeed appreciative of his acceptance of the referral and the detailed and careful submissions advanced both in writing and at the hearing of the appeal. Now before the Court are: (i) an application by the Respondent Minister to file a Notice of Contention ; (ii) an application by the Appellant to file an Amended Notice of Appeal ; and (iii) the existing Notice of Appeal .

cited,State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (In liq) (1999) 160 ALR 583,The appellant contends that Smith FM erred in this finding and that the appellant's manner could have been ascertained by his Honour examining the transcript and listening to the tapes.

referred to,General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) and Others [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125,"respondents claim that this alternative claim is not maintainable as a matter of law and should be struck out. They rely on the Court's power in O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules to strike out part of a pleading which discloses no reasonable cause of action. In essence, their argument is that there are no circumstances in which Mr Humphries' claim for rescission would fail and yet his claim for alternative relief would succeed. In my opinion, Mr Humphries' claim for alternative relief is not unarguable in the sense referred to in the authorities ( General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) and Others [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125) and the respondents' application in relation to Mr Humphries' claim for alternative relief must be refused. As I have said, Mr Humphries claims a right to rescind the property contracts, or an order under s 87 of the TPA that the property contracts have been rescinded, or are rescinded. He then makes the following allegations, in the alternative: ""106.6 Alternatively an order refusing to enforce the Contracts against the Applicant or alternatively that the Respondents be precluded from maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the market value or the settlement date being before the date on which allotments in Stage 3 commence to be sold or claiming that the Applicant is in default or is liable to pay or forfeit any monies to them. 106.7 In the alternative to paragraph 106.3 above, an order that the First Respondent and the Second Respondent be permanently restrained from calling upon the Bank Guarantees."" The claim for relief in paragraph 106.3 is for a declaration that the applicant is entitled to the destruction or return of the bank guarantees. The claims for relief in paragraphs 106.6 and 106.7 are based on earlier paragraphs which are challenged. Paragraph 82 is in the following terms: ""82 Alternatively, pursuant to section 87 , an order should be made refusing to enforce the Property Contracts and the second Marina Berth Agreement against the Applicant or alternatively that Newport Quays 2 be precluded from: 82.1 maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the true market value of the Properties being $805,000 for terrace No 44 and $315,000 for sky home No 607; 82.2 maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the true market value of the second Marina Berth being $60,000; 82.3 acting under clause 7.1 to claim that the Applicant is in default under the Property Contracts or the second Marina Berth Agreement or is liable to pay or forfeit any monies to Newport Quays."""
considered,Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 367 ; (2002) 121 FCR 383,"Both the parties and the Tribunal discussed the decision of the Full Court in Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 367 ; (2002) 121 FCR 383. In that case, the Full Court addressed at 388 what might constitute an ""error"" for the purposes of an application for reinstatement under s 42A(10) of the AAT Act : 'The fault may have lain elsewhere, provided it induced the error. For example, because of a mistake as to his or her instructions, a solicitor or other representative of a party might have wrongly consented to a dismissal order or filed a notice of discontinuance. No fault would attach to the Tribunal; but, if the solicitor's mistake induced the dismissal of the action, it could properly be said the application had been ""dismissed in error"".' Having considered the material before it, the Full Court found that the word ""error"" is not limited to administrative errors on the part of the Tribunal. Rather, the term could include errors of any kind which related to the application before the Tribunal and which were operative in leading to the dismissal of that application. An example of such an error is a mistake by the applicant's legal or other representative, such as misconstruing the applicant's instructions, thereby inducing an erroneous dismissal of the application by the Tribunal. 8 Counsel for the applicant submitted that, on its face, the Tribunal's reasons disclose error. Mr Karp pointed to the observation at [11] in the reasons of the Tribunal that the applicant's evidence suggested that he did not have any view as to whether the Tribunal proceedings should be commenced or concluded. Mr Karp submitted that the Tribunal, because it neither considered nor found that there was ""informed consent"" on the part of the applicant to the withdrawal of the review application, but rather simply observed that the applicant had given general instructions to Mr Jones to procure a particular outcome by whatever means he thought best, thus committed jurisdictional error. 9 There are two difficulties with this submission. The first is that it is contrary to, and therefore seeks to challenge, the express finding by the Tribunal at [12] that there was no evidence that Mr Jones erred in the execution of the instructions given to him by the applicant. 10 The second difficulty is that the Tribunal at [6] specifically considered the principle expressed in Goldie 121 FCR at 388 that a mistake by a representative of an applicant could, in certain circumstances, induce an ""error"" sufficient to ground an application for reinstatement. It is not to be lightly inferred that, having expressly referred to this principle, the Tribunal would ignore it when making a determination. The Tribunal also considered the statement of issues prepared by Mr Jones concerning the proposed withdrawal of the applicant's review application, and the statement by the applicant that he was unaware of the decision to withdraw. Having done so, the Tribunal found at [12] that the evidence indicated that Mr Jones had not misunderstood or failed to execute the instructions given to him by the applicant. This conclusion is a finding of fact which was open to the Tribunal on the evidence before it, and which took into account the Full Court's observations in Goldie 121 FCR at 388. Accordingly, there is no error of law shown in the reasoning of the Tribunal in relation to this issue. 11 In addition to the submissions advanced by Mr Karp and discussed above, the original Notice of Appeal recites five grounds of appeal. None of these grounds are established in the present case. 12 The first ground alleges that the Tribunal's reasons disclose jurisdictional error and breach rules of natural justice. This ground of appeal must be rejected. Neither the assertion of jurisdictional error nor the assertion of a breach of natural justice are relevant to the decision under review, which concerns whether or not an application should be reinstated, and does not address the merits of any claim to refugee status. 13 The second ground of appeal alleges that the Tribunal failed to consider specific material relevant to the application for reinstatement. This ground fails because the reasons of the Tribunal disclose that the material was referred to and considered. 14 The third ground also alleges that the Tribunal failed to consider certain information. This ground must fail because it discloses no basis on which the Tribunal can be said to have ignored the information, or on which the information can be said to be of such importance that a failure to address it would constitute jurisdictional error. This ground may also be interpreted as alleging that the applicant did not consent to the withdrawal of the review application, and thus the Tribunal's reasons fell into error. For the reasons given above, this submission cannot be accepted."
referred to,Abbott v Random House Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1540,"The usual rule is that costs are payable on a party and party basis, unless the circumstances of the case warrant a departure from the normal course: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 ("" Colgate-Palmolive "") at 233 per Sheppard J and O 62 of the Rules. In Colgate-Palmolive , Sheppard J referred to the circumstances in which indemnity costs might be awarded, mentioning, amongst other things, ""the fact that the proceedings were commenced or continued ... in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law"" and ""the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions"", though noting that ""[t]he question must always be whether the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question warrant the making of an order for payment of costs other than on a party and party basis"": see Colgate-Palmolive at 233-34. The Full Court reconsidered the appropriateness of an indemnity costs award in Re Wilcox: Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 ("" Re Wilcox "") at 152-53 per Black CJ and 156-58 per Cooper and Merkel JJ. In Re Wilcox , at 156-57, Cooper and Merkel JJ reiterated Sheppard J's approach, saying: In order to exercise the discretion [regarding costs] judicially the following principles have been accepted by the Court as applicable: (a) the Court ought not to depart from the rule that costs be ordered on a party and party basis unless the circumstances of the case warrant the Court in departing from the usual course; (b) the circumstances which may warrant departure from the usual course arise as and when the justice of the case so requires or where there may be some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the court in departing from the usual course; (c) whilst the circumstances in cases in which indemnity costs have been ordered offer a guide, the question must always be whether the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question warrant the making of an order for costs other than on a party and party basis. See also Abbott v Random House Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1540 at [5] per Beaumont, Miles and Drummond JJ, quoting the above passage with approval. Even more recently, the Full Court in Hamod v New South Wales [2002] FCA 424 ; (2002) 188 ALR 659 at 665 (per Gray J, with whom Carr and Goldberg JJ agreed) explained the basal principle for an award of indemnity costs in the following terms: Indemnity costs are not designed to punish a party for persisting with a case that turns out to fail. They are not awarded as a means of deterring litigants from putting forward arguments that might be attended by uncertainty. Rather, they serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred, as a normal costs order could not be expected to do, when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs."
referred to,Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 104,"at the time of the mediation, the company appeared to have limited financial capacity. As I have said, it was uninsured. Its last trading price was $0.01, which is the lowest price that can be quoted on the ASX. This is a matter of considerable importance in determining whether to exercise the power. I will refer later to the similar circumstances that arose in Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 104. The terms of settlement provide that the parties to the agreement are the applicants in each proceeding, the respondents and the group members referred to in each of the proceedings. Clause 2 of the agreement provides the essential terms of the settlement, which are that there is to be a verdict for the respondents, and the respondents are to pay to the applicants the sum of $3 million in full and final settlement of both sets of proceedings. In Lopez , Finkelstein J referred at [16] to the onerous task involved in the consideration of an application. As I mentioned earlier, the application in Lopez has some striking similarities to the situation which arises in the present matter. That is because, in Lopez , there was a very real likelihood that if the case went to a final hearing, the group members would not receive anything like the amount they will receive upon the approval of the compromise. The reason for this was that the company was hopelessly insolvent and success in the proceeding would have left group members in a position where their claim would be reduced to the ability to prove in a winding up. As his Honour remarked at [19], ""that is hardly an enticing position"". A further similarity in Lopez was that there was an insurance fund which was available. His Honour referred at [23] to the effect of s 562 of the then Corporations Law which had the effect that the approval of the settlement and the application of the insurance funds would not, in any way, adversely affect the interests of unsecured creditors of the company. Whilst Village Life is conceded to have limited assets, what I have said about Lopez is not to suggest in any way that the company is insolvent. In this case, as Mr Abadee submitted, the stark consequences of the Court withholding its approval to the settlement would be that any successful judgment that may be obtained by the applicants and subsequently by group members would be wiped out by the legal costs which would be incurred in pursuing the proceedings to final judgment. The estimate of those costs provided in Mr Moulis's affidavit, is in an amount of approximately $4.8 million. Mr Moulis is an experienced practitioner in this field, and I accept his estimate as being within the range in this type of matter. It seems to me to be likely that the individual respondents, who would be entitled to indemnity from the insurer, would incur costs of that order in defending the proceedings. Accordingly, if the matter were to proceed to a final hearing, the entire amount of the insurance fund would be eaten up by legal fees. That is, of course, an unfortunate consequence of the complexity of this type of proceeding. Nevertheless, it is a fact which informs the fairness and reasonableness of the settlement which has been reached. Although the letter from the individual respondents' solicitors suggests that two of the respondents may have some funds at present, it is, in my view, reasonable to infer that were the matter to proceed to final judgment, all of the personal respondents would have to eat into their own assets to such an extent that there would be nothing left for the applicant and group members. That is to say there would be no financial return from success in the proceeding."
cited,"Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 9) [2006] FCA 1242","Pursuant to that liberty, Bowesco and Lanepoint, by their common director, Karen Carey-Hazell, have each applied to the Court for orders directing the receiver to make provisions to enable them to meet various legal expenses including the costs of resisting the winding up applications in proceedings WAD 177 of 2006 ( ASIC v Bowesco ) and WAD 152 of 2006 ( ASIC v Lanepoint ). They also apply for funding for legal services in relation to the prosecution of an application by Bowesco for leave to appeal against my decision, made on 14 September 2006, relating to Bowesco's entitlement to an option to purchase certain property, which option had been assigned to it by Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 9) [2006] FCA 1242. Pursuant to an order made by Siopis J on 17 October 2006 a motion for leave to appeal out of time and for leave to appeal that decision was referred to the Full Court in the November sittings. The applications also seek orders for the provision of funding for legal services in relation to certain other matters. 4 The applications, insofar as they relate to the winding up proceedings, are made pursuant to the liberty to apply given on 30 August 2006 in those proceedings. The other directions sought, although brought in these winding up proceedings, should properly be the subject of separate substantive applications. I am prepared, however, because of the urgency of the matters and particularly the pending application by Bowesco for leave to appeal in relation to the option dispute, to deal with the merits of those applications in this judgment on the basis that any substantive application should be filed before the orders sought take effect. 5 The Court is asked to make all of the orders sought as an exercise of the power conferred upon it by s 423(1)(b) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). That provision allows for a person to complain to the Court about an act or omission of a controller of property of a corporation in connection with performing or exercising any of the controller's functions and powers. In such a case the Court may inquire into the matter and, where the Court so inquires, it may take such action as it thinks fit. For reasons given below, I do not consider that s 423(1)(b) is an appropriate basis for the orders sought as an incident of the winding up application. Indeed, it seems to have been put forward by Lanepoint and Bowesco as opening a doorway to a broader inquiry into the conduct of the receiverships. 6 The alternative basis upon which the applications rest is s 1321 of the Act. Lanepoint and Bowesco in effect appeal to this Court against the refusal by their receivers and managers to make available, out of the funds under their control, funding for legal representation in the winding up proceedings and for the other purposes to which reference has been made. 7 For the reasons that follow, in my opinion, provision should be made by the receivers and managers of Lanepoint for Bowesco's reasonable legal costs in defending the winding up application brought against it, in meeting the legal costs of this application and in prosecuting its application for leave to appeal. The orders sought by Lanepoint are not acceded to nor the remaining orders sought by Bowesco."
cited,Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated v The Commonwealth of Australia [1979] HCA 1 ; (1980) 146 CLR 493,"First, it is clear from a number of cases that the fact that the case is a human rights and/or discrimination case does not of itself automatically characterise the proceedings as being in the public interest with the result that the court should divert from usual orders as to costs ( Sluggett v HREOC [2002] FCA 1060 and Fetherson v Peninsula Health (No 2) [2004] FCA 594). Similar considerations apply where, for example, the proceedings are instituted by a litigant with a view to protection of the environment ( Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated v The Commonwealth of Australia [1979] HCA 1 ; (1980) 146 CLR 493; Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth (2006) 230 ALR 411). 31 Fifth, the fact that the applicant's claim was dismissed for want of standing distinguishes this case from cases such as Oshlack [1998] HCA 11 ; 193 CLR 72 and Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; 115 FCR 229, where the plaintiff did have standing and the merits of the case could be properly explored by the Court.

cited,Harvey v Jacob (1817) 1 B &amp; Ald 159; (1817) 106 ER 59,"Stephen Colbran notes in his text Security for Costs (Longman Professional, 1993) at 41, that prior to the enactment of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) [36 &amp; 37 Vict, c 66) security for costs did not apply to past costs and nor would further security be required for a new trial (although an interesting exception to this rule appears to be in the case of Harvey v Jacob (1817) 1 B &amp; Ald 159, 106 ER 59 where the plaintiff, having been convicted of a felony and receiving a sentence of transportation to Australia, was ordered to give security for costs retrospective and prospective). However in 2006 the discretion of the Federal Court vested by s 56 Federal Court Act and s 1335 Corporations Act is very broad, and there is nothing in the terms of either section which would in any way limit the discretion of the Court or its jurisdiction to order security for costs already incurred by the respondents. Indeed, a review of the case law indicates that it is not uncommon for courts to order security for costs already incurred. Examples of cases where such orders have been made are Brocklebank &amp; Co v King's Lynn Steam Ship Co (1878) 3 CPD 365; Massey v Allen (1879) 12 ChD 807; JWH Turner &amp; Co Ltd v O'Riordan (1923) 40 WN (NSW) 64; Estates Property Investment Corporation Ltd v Pooley (1975) 3 ACLR 256; Procon (Great Britain) Ltd v Provincial Building Co Ltd [1984] 1 WLR 557; and Bryan E Fencott (and see the discussion of this topic in Colbran at pp 291-292)."
cited,Compaq Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Merry (1998) 157 ALR 1,The next question is whether the CEPU's conduct attracts liability under ss 76(1) and 80(1). The principles of accessorial liability applicable to the present case can be shortly stated. It is necessary to prove knowledge of the essential elements constituting the contravention: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 670. The requirement of 'knowledge' is actual and not constructive knowledge: Giorgianni at 504-507; Compaq Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Merry (1998) 157 ALR 1 at 5.

cited,GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1,"As to the instruction of lawyers, the funding agreement provided that instructions in the proceedings were to be given by Mr Gurtler, not by Hillcrest: see cl 4. However and despite the ""no oral modification"" clause in the agreement, it was open to Mr Gurtler and Hillcrest to vary this if they so wished: see GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at [213] - [227] . I would note, though, that the funding agreement probably did not preclude Mr Gurtler's use of the agency of Hillcrest in giving instructions in any event. 51 What is clear on the material before me is that, whether or not Hillcrest has acted in strict accordance with the written terms of the funding agreement, the manner of his communication with Williams &amp; Hughes was acquiesced in by Mr Gurtler. This is made clear in his affidavit verifying the list of documents produced. He designedly, as a matter of convenience, had Mr Van Noort deal directly with the lawyers to confirm his instructions or to comment upon their advice in order to enable the lawyers to further advance his case. It is unsurprising that he adopted this course given that as between them Mr Van Noort, as a lawyer, was likely to be more able to make forensic choices than Mr Gurtler: cf Fostif NSWCA at [137]. 52 The 31 July email was one Mr Van Noort should never have sent. Nonetheless, on its face, and for the purposes of the Finance Now's present contention, it purports to have been in furtherance of the common interests of Mr Gurtler and Hillcrest. Mr Gurtler may have been unaware of its contents. Still he authorised Mr Van Noort's contact with Mr Hambrett. Whatever complaint Mr Gurtler may have had of his agent's conduct a matter between himself and his agent to which Finance Now was a stranger the email itself provides no basis for suggesting that Van Noort was acting other than in Gurtler's, hence their common, interest in the matter."
cited,Ku-Ring-Gai Municipal Council v Suburban Centres Pty Ltd (1971) 2 NSWLR 335,"Historically, courts have been disinclined to hear and determine matters where the issues in controversy no longer have real practical significance. In Glasgow Navigation Company v Iron Ore Company [1910] AC 293 at 294, Lord Loreburn LC stated that it was not the function of a Court of law to advise parties as to what would be their rights under a hypothetical state of facts (cf Sutch v Burns [1944] KB 406, King v Lewis [1949] NZLR 779, Sumner v William Henderson &amp; Sons [1963] 2 All ER 712, Ku-Ring-Gai Municipal Council v Suburban Centres Pty Ltd (1971) 2 NSWLR 335, and Swift Australian Co (Pty) Ltd v South British Insurance Co Ltd [1970] VR 368, City of Norwood, Payneham and St Peters v Baker [2004] SASC 135). A useful illustration of the principle is the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Hole v Insurance Commissioner [1962] VR 394 where the respondent had obtained a judgment for the sum of [sterling]300 and costs against the Insurance Commissioner. The Insurance Commissioner appealed to set aside the judgment. The appeal involved the construction of a section of an exclusion clause in a policy of insurance. The court was informed however that the Insurance Commissioner had paid the judgment debt and costs to the respondent, and that the parties had agreed that the Insurance Commissioner would neither seek the return of those moneys nor a new trial should the appeal succeed. In refusing to proceed further with the appeal, the Full Court observed: 'There is, therefore, now no real contest between the parties as to the right to that [sterling]300. We have, therefore, a position in which this Court is asked to deal with a matter where the legal rights of the parties to that [sterling]300 are not now in actual controversy...we think, as the matters now stand, what the Court is really asked to do is to give an advisory opinion on the construction of the policy of insurance.'

affirmed,MZYDA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FMCA 859,"appellant filed an application for review in the Federal Magistrates Court on 24 December 2008. One ground of review was specified, namely, that ""[t]he decision of the Tribunal was made without jurisdiction or [was] affected by an error of jurisdiction"". Five particulars were specified. They are set out at para [4] of MZYDA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FMCA 859. The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application for review. The appellant seeks prerogative relief of the kind issued in the exercise of the Federal Court's original jurisdiction under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The Notice of Appeal filed in this Court on 6 October 2009 was substantially a reproduction of the application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court (see [8] above). The ground of appeal, and the corresponding particulars, in this Court were: The decision of the Court / Tribunal was made without jurisdiction or is affected by an error of jurisdiction. Particulars The Court and the tribunal misconstrued and misinterpreted the convention criterion in that the test is not whether the Sri Lankan government was unable or unwilling to protect the [appellant], but rather whether the [appellant] owing to a well founded fear is unable or unwilling to avail himself the protection of the country. The Court and the tribunal clearly has not understood the criterion for refugee status and applied the wrong test and thereby fell into jurisdictional error. The tribunal did not discuss how the degree of state protection available in Sri Lanka could make fear of persecution at the hands of the PA and JVP members / supporters an unfounded fear. There was no reference to any country information and the tribunal was duty bound to appraise itself of the situation and if it did refer to country information, there would have been detailed information about the violence that takes place at election time between the UNP and the PA and information specifically about the police force, reference to the police force being politicized and information about politicians who interfere with police activities and how politicians rampantly manipulate the police force. The Court and the tribunal have erred in that it did not take into account the fact that the [appellant's] mother and brother fear for their safety because it is common practice amongst political opponents in Sri Lanka to kidnap and murder family members in order to force the targeted person to cooperate with their demands. The tribunal did not properly consider the claim that the [appellant] would be persecuted on account of his membership of his father's family, being a particular social group. At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant requested an adjournment in order to seek legal assistance. The appellant submitted the adjournment was necessary for two reasons: so that the appellant could request that the first respondent to grant him working rights so that he could afford legal assistance; that the appellant was unable to make legal submissions without legal assistance. That application was refused: MZYDA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1389. The appellant made no substantive oral submissions to the Court, notwithstanding that the first respondent had explained to the appellant that he would be expected to do so both in a letter dated 17 November 2009 and by telephone. The appellant informed the Court that he had been in Australia for 14 years and he could not return to Sri Lanka. For the reasons that follow, I cannot identify an appellable error. The appeal has no prospects of success. I will now consider each particular in turn. GROUND 1(A): INCORRECT TEST APPLIED BY THE COURT AND TRIBUNAL"
referred to,Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903,"I will not recite the details of all the interlocutory steps taken in the proceedings. However, two should be mentioned. On 4 April 2007 I refused an application by the applicant for summary judgment on part of its claim: Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 489. In May 2007 I dealt with an application by the respondents for a stay or dismissal of the proceedings by reason of non-compliance by the applicant with various orders of the Court. The details of the application are set out in my reasons on a question of costs: Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903."
approved,Toy Centre Agencies Pty Ltd v Spencer (1983) 67 FLR 458,"The circumstances in which the Attorney-General may exercise the right conferred by s 18(1) to intervene "" on behalf of the Commonwealth "" are not, however, confined to those in which named respondents may otherwise be placed in the position of having to defend their own decisions or conduct. The ultimate objective of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), it will be recalled: ...is to ensure that decisions of public servants and others which affect the rights, prospects and property of citizens, are made after giving careful consideration to the questions involved in the particular case, so that it is more likely that the decision will be right and justice done to the persons affected by it: Toy Centre Agencies Pty Ltd v Spencer (1983) 67 FLR 458 at 466 per Lockhart J. The manner in which the 1977 Act may impact upon the Commonwealth is thus diverse. Equally diverse are the circumstances in which the Attorney-General may seek to intervene to represent the interests of the Commonwealth. It would thus be far from prudent to attempt to define or categorise in advance those interests of the Commonwealth which would permit the Attorney-General to exercise his right of intervention."
cited,Nonferral (NSW) Pty Ltd v Taufia (1998) 43 NSWLR 312,"In my view, the second step is equally problematical for the applicant. In addition, there is nothing in the Seafarers Act itself to support the contention for the reasons just discussed. An employee is defined in s 4 to include a seafarer, and a seafarer is defined in s 3 to include a person employed in any capacity on a prescribed ship. As a matter of fact, the respondent was employed on the Iron Chieftain operated by the applicant. On the clear wording of s 26 of the Seafarers Act, if the respondent as an employee suffered an injury which resulted in his incapacity for work, compensation was payable to him for that injury under the Seafarers Act. It would be a wholly disproportionate consequence of the applicant's contention that he would be ineligible for compensation, even if the non-disclosure or incomplete disclosure of his medical condition was accidental or through oversight, or if it related to a condition which had no relevance to his capacity to perform his duties. It is difficult to accept that outcome would have been intended in legislation which has a significant social objective. The analysis of the relative significance of the information which has been either not disclosed or inaccurately reported regarding the past medical history, and its relationship to the injury, or of the reasons for its non-disclosure or inaccurate disclosure, is not one upon which, in my view, the entitlement to compensation under the Seafarers Act are predicated. That may be one of the situations which, subject to considering the applicant's further contentions, ss 26(3) or 10(7) of the Seafarers Act is designed to cover. The disproportionality to which I have referred is a relevant consideration to the construction for which the applicant contends: cf Nonferral (NSW) Pty Ltd v Taufia (1998) 43 NSWLR 312 at 316. Indeed, the point was made in Visscher 147 FCR at 542 that a medical certificate is not conclusive of the question of fitness to undertake particular duties. In that case, the Full Court at 542 adopted a submission of counsel that: ... the regulatory scheme that is established by the [Navigation] Act and the Orders is a licensing system of a familiar generic sort, of which the issuing of medical certificates is part. It does not, either expressly or impliedly, deal with the contractual relationship between employers and employees."

followed,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214,"The grounds of appeal were in the following terms: 1. Federal Magistrate grossly breached the rules procedural fairness (and also appellant's fundamental right to be heard) by refusing to consider the written submission made by the appellant on the date of final hearing while taking oral submissions made by the legal representatives for the first respondent. [sic] 2. Federal Magistrate erred in law by rejecting to apply the law created by the High Court in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 and instead applying a Federal Court cases MIMA v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 and SZCIJ v MIMA [2006] FCAFC 62. This is contrary to the fact that the High Court applied "" Kioa"" in recent refugee cases in 2006 and 2005. [sic] 3. Federal Magistrate erred in law by ignoring the submission that the tribunal breached the s 441A thus the tribunal committed an jurisdictional error. [sic] 4. Federal Magistrate erred in law in her finding that the appellant is entitled to ""limited"" rules of procedural fairness. Appellant says that this is contrary to the findings of High Court in cases such as VEAL v MIMA [2005] HCA 72 , SAAP v MIMA [2005] HCA 24 , SZBEL v MIMA [2006] HCA 63 , and NAFF v MIMA [2004] HCA 62. [sic] PARTICULARS Federal magistrate found that the appellant is not entitled to the rules of procedural fairness established by the High Court of Australia; instead the appellant's only entitlement in procedural fairness is limited to the sections of the Act. 5. Federal Magistrate erred in law by ignoring an important procedural fairness issue raised in the application to the court; in particular the appellant complained that ""the tribunal member while taking evidence did not allow the appellant to refer to his written notes and still regarded appellant's changed memory of date of assault (April 2001 and later April 2002) was a serious mistake"". [sic] 6. Federal Magistrate erred in law by finding that the tribunal is entitled to obtain the independent information from whatever the sources it chooses. [sic] This is a serious misreading of s 424(1) of the Migration Act 1958 . I will now deal with each of the grounds of appeal in turn. 30 In dealing with ground 1 of the judicial review application in which the appellant had alleged failure by the Tribunal to comply with s 424A , the learned Federal Magistrate noted that he had referred in his written submissions to various extracts from judgments of the High Court in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550. She said (at [35]): Counsel for the First Respondent correctly submitted that the common law principles of procedural fairness identified by the High Court in Kioa are not necessarily applicable to the proceeding before this Court. Section 422B of the Act has the effect that all that is required of the Tribunal in so far as procedural fairness is concerned is to comply with the provisions of the Act ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [(2006) [2006] FCAFC 61 ; 151 FCR 214] and SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62). Accordingly, the Applicant's written submissions referring to the common law rule of procedural fairness are misconceived in so-far as they relate to the matter before this Court. 31 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214 the Full Court held that s 51A of the Act operates to exclude the common law fair hearing rule in relation to offshore visa applications. Section 51A relates to ministerial grants of visas to non-citizens. Its effect is similar to that of s 422B in its application to Tribunal hearings. Similar provision is made by s 357A in relation to Migration Review Tribunal hearings. The operation of these sections has been considered in a large number of authorities which were referred to by the Full Court in its judgment. The Court said, in relation to Subdiv AB in which s 51A is found: 66. What was intended was that Subdiv AB provide comprehensive procedural codes which contain detailed provisions for procedural fairness but which exclude the common law natural justice hearing rule. 67. Other aspects of the common law of natural justice, such as the bias rule are not excluded: see ( VXDC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 ; (2005) 146 FCR 562 at [27] ). 68. The intention to exclude the common law rules in the present case is especially plain when s 51A(1) is read with s 57(3). The legislature could hardly have intended to provide the full panoply of common law natural justice to visa applicants who are required to be outside Australia when the visa is granted, while conferring a more limited form of statutory protection upon onshore applicants. The same Full Court in SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62 , said that s 422B excludes the common law natural justice hearing rule for the reasons given, in relation to s 51A, in Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; 151 FCR 214."
cited,Trustees of the Property of Cummins v Cummins [2006] HCA 6 ; (2006) 227 CLR 278,"Trustees of the Property of Cummins v Cummins [2006] HCA 6 ; (2006) 227 CLR 278 , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed: [71] ...the following view expressed in the present edition of Professor Scott's work respecting beneficial ownership of the matrimonial home [ The Law of Trusts , 4th ed (1989), vol 5, &#167;454 at 239] should be accepted: It is often a purely accidental circumstance whether money of the husband or of the wife is actually used to pay the purchase price to the vendor, where both are contributing by money or labour to the various expenses of the household. It is often a matter of chance whether the family expenses are incurred and discharged or services are rendered in the maintenance of the home before or after the purchase. ... [72] That reasoning applies with added force in the present case where the title was taken in the joint names of the spouses. There is no occasion for equity to fasten upon the registered interest held by the joint tenants a trust obligation representing differently proportionate interests as tenants in common. The subsistence of the matrimonial relationship, as Mason and Brennan JJ emphasised in Calverley v Green [(1984) [1984] HCA 81 ; 155 CLR 242 at 259], supports the choice of joint tenancy with the prospect of survivorship. ...The range of financial considerations and accidental circumstances in the matrimonial relationship referred to by Professor Scott answers the second concern of equity, namely the disproportion between quantum of beneficial ownership and contribution to the acquisition of the matrimonial home. In Cummins [2006] HCA 6 ; (2006) 227 CLR 278 the High Court upheld the decision of the primary judge that the subject of the relevant disposition of land was that which appeared on the transfer, namely the interest of the husband as joint tenant of the matrimonial home, without any displacement to allow for a beneficial tenancy in common in shares of which the larger was that of the wife. In these proceedings there is no dispute that the Carrara property, described in the financial agreement as the matrimonial home, was registered in the names of the respondent and Mr Jensen as joint tenants. The decision of the High Court in Cummins [2006] HCA 6 ; (2006) 227 CLR 278 supports an inference of joint tenancy with the prospect of survivorship as to the equitable interest held by the parties to the marriage. The pleadings of the respondent do not displace this inference, nor did the submissions at the hearing. In my view paras 7e, 10e, 10(ea), 24e and 24f of the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim are untenable. Conclusion It follows that paras 7e, 10 and 24 of the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim should be struck out."

This further issue was raised by Mr Rhodes by way of challenge to the exercise by AFMA of its power of cancellation of Mr Rhodes' fishing permit for reasons of so-called 'non-payment of fees or levies'; it was acknowledged that '[i]n determining the scope of the obligation of natural justice, the statutory framework is of crucial importance'. I was referred by Mr Rhodes to the High Court decision of Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1963] HCA 41 ; (1963) 113 CLR 475, where in the reasons for judgment of Kitto J at 502-4, his Honour considered whether the Taxation Board of Review was '... legally bound to conform to the principles of natural justice in dealing with a reference in a case under s 136' . Kitto J made the prefatory observations that '[a] legal obligation so to act arises in respect of many statutory powers...', there being '... no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of tribunal...', but '[w]hat the law requires in the discharge of a quasi-judicial function is judicial fairness' , which is '... not a label for any fixed body of rules...,' and '[w]hat is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances' . The statutory context of the then Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1958 (Cth), which was of course in focus in Mobil Oil , is significantly removed from that of the Management Act. Mr Rhodes sought support additionally for the operation in principle of the rules as to natural justice from the dictum of Brennan J in National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd [1984] HCA 29 ; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 326, where his Honour observed as follows: the limits of a statutory function are ascertained the interests which are apt to be affected by the performance of the function can be identified. Then it is possible for a court to say in the absence of express statutory provision what has to be done to be fair to those whose interests are apt to be affected by the performance of the function. The terms of the statute which creates the function, the nature of the function and the administrative framework in which the statute requires the function to be performed are material factors in determining what must be done to satisfy the requirements of natural justice....' Those considerations render formidable the task of establishing the operation of the rules of natural justice in the present statutory context where the basis for prospective qualification would be the same for all applicants, that being the holding of an existing shark permit conditional of course upon payment of the permit fee or levy."

Accordingly, Diageo submitted that leave should not be granted with respect to the amendments in paras 47C, 47D and 48A to 48C. They amount to statements of legal propositions and are embarrassing. For this reason, no leave should be given to amend paras 48 and 49 because Spirits have not pleaded any material facts in support of the amendments. When pressed, Senior Counsel for Spirits submitted that the opening words of para 48: 'By reason of the matters pleaded above ...', is a reference to paras 38 to 47D of the proposed FASC, and that para 47D is a pleading of fact. I tend to agree with the latter submission although it might be more accurate to describe para 47D as a pleading of mixed fact and law, as it would be to describe a number of the other pleadings from para 38 onwards."
cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April International Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd (2007) ATPR p42-210,"Commission relies on s 6 of the Trade Practices Act to extend the operation of s 45 to natural persons if their conduct relates to trade with Australia. This would make the liability of the individual respondents direct and not ancillary to that of the corporate respondents. There was some discussion of the availability of that section in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April International Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd (2007) ATPR p42-210. The Commission points to the various positions of employment of the individual April foreign respondents, the structure of the APRIL Group's operations, the nature of the meetings and the arrangements entered into to infer that the individuals were present on behalf of each of April FPT, April Holdings and April Management and that the relevant conduct was engaged in on behalf of those corporate respondents. Annexed to these reasons (Annexure A) is a chart provided by the Commission of the structure of the APRIL Group and the position of the individual April foreign respondents within that structure. The evidence supports the conclusions drawn in the chart as to the relationship of the corporations and individuals named. The evidence also provides the basis for an inference that Mr Lim and Mr Choo were officers of April FPT, April Holdings and April Management in the capacity of being very senior sales and marketing executives with regional, if not worldwide, responsibilities, so that the conduct of the individuals is attributable to those corporations."
discussed,Hill v Repatriation Commission (2004) 39 AAR 103,"The issue as to Mr Hill's eligibility for an invalidity service pension has previously been addressed by the AAT: Hill v Repatriation Commission [2003] AATA 114. It had affirmed the decision of the Repatriation Commission to reject that claim. The Court found legal error in that decision: Hill v Repatriation Commission (2004) 39 AAR 103, and on appeal: Repatriation Commission v Hill [2005] FCAFC 7 ; (2005) 142 FCR 88, so the claim was remitted to the AAT for reconsideration. On 31 October 2006 the AAT again affirmed the decision that Mr Hill was not entitled to an invalidity service pension under the Act: Hill v Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 925. It did so because it was not satisfied that he was permanently incapacitated for work in accordance with a determination under s 37AA of the Act."
cited,Macteldir Pty Ltd v Dimovski (2005) 226 ALR 773,"my opinion, Hepbourne has, by these contractual undertakings, bound itself not to prosecute a claim of the kind pursued in its cross-claim. These undertakings would be enforceable by the Court: cf Macteldir Pty Ltd v Dimovski (2005) 226 ALR 773 at 796 and the authorities there cited. The Court should not permit Hepbourne to prosecute a cross-claim of the kind presently attempted in breach of contractual undertakings. In particular, it should not do so in circumstances in which Deckers' defence stands unanswered. Judgment should be entered against Hepbourne and Mr Mykhalovskyi. By agreement, costs orders in the sum of $1,000,000 have already been made jointly and severally against Vladimir, Josef, Victoria and Polina Vaysman and companies associated with some of them. It is appropriate that Hepbourne and Mr Mykhalovskyi should also be jointly and severally liable for Deckers' costs to this extent. Orders to this effect should be made.

referred to,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609,"In dealing with the s 424A(1) point, the Federal Magistrate, (citing VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 , which was approved by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609) , held that the Tribunal was not obliged to provide the particular information to the appellant because the information related to the Tribunal's thought processes, and therefore did not attract the operation of s 424A(1). In addressing the appellant's claim that this information related to him personally and was significant, his Honour stated: ""The findings in respect of which the Applicant says he should have been informed were general findings not specific to him personally. The circumstances of the White Eagles political movement was plainly a matter of general import, not one wholly specific to him. Although the Applicant claimed to be a leader of the group in Hashuri, nonetheless this was plainly information about a class of persons and not information solely limited to the Applicant himself."""

referred to,Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd and Others [1988] FCA 202 ; (1988) 81 ALR 397,"AIA submits that the principles referred to by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 apply in respect of proceedings which are conducted in such manner such as to warrant an order for indemnity costs. At page 233 his Honour observed that orders for indemnity costs might be made where proceedings had been conducted: ... in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law (Woodward J in Fountain and French J in J-Corp (supra)); the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (Davies J in Ragata ); an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise (eg Messiter v Hutchinson (1987) 10 NSWLR 525, Maitland Hospital v Fisher (No 2) (1992) 27 NSWLR 721 at 724 (Court of Appeal); Crisp v Keng (unreported, Court of Appeal, NSW, Kirby P, Priestley JA, Cripps JA, No 40744/1992, 27 September 1993)... 11 In Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd and Others [1988] FCA 202 ; (1988) 81 ALR 397 Woodwood J (at 400-401) observed that the Court had an 'absolute and unfettered' discretion with regard to the award of costs. In Donald Campbell and Company Limited v Pollak [1927] AC 732 Viscount Cave L.C. said at 811-812: A successful defendant in a non-jury case has no doubt, in the absence of special circumstances, a reasonable expectation of obtaining an order for the payment of his costs by the plaintiff; but he has no right to costs unless and until the Court awards them to him, and the Court has an absolute and unfettered discretion to award or not to award them. This discretion, like any other discretion, must of course be exercised judicially, and the judge ought not to exercise it against the successful party except for some reason connected with the case. In Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 McHugh J at 569 adopted his Lordship's observations."

If it had been established that the document was authentic, the Tribunal might not have made the adverse credit findings. That being the case, in my opinion, the appellant has been denied a fair hearing and the Tribunal has fallen into jurisdictional error. Not every statement made by the Tribunal to an applicant which is factually incorrect or may mislead will give rise to a finding that the Tribunal has fallen into jurisdictional error. The statement or representation must give rise to unfairness in the sense that the applicant was denied a fair hearing: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFDJ [2006] FCAFC 53 at [30] .

applied,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Ame [2005] HCA 36 ; (2005) 222 CLR 439,"Nonetheless, under the Migration Act a person born in Papua after the commencement of the Citizenship Act required an entry permit to be entitled to enter or reside in any of the States or internal territories ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Ame [2005] HCA 36 ; (2005) 222 CLR 439 at [1] ). This was because Papua, as an external Territory, was not part of ""Australia"" for the purposes of the Migration Act ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Walsh [2002] FCAFC 205 ; (2002) 125 FCR 31 at [15] - [21] cited with approval in Ex parte Ame at [1]). 45 More significantly, in Ex parte Ame , in the majority judgment at [21], the High Court said of the proposition that the applicant in that case was a person who had a right of permanent residence in Australia within the meaning of s 65(4)(a) of the PNG Constitution : This is not an abstract or theoretical question. It concerns the meaning of words in an instrument of nationhood and government, dealing with a practical issue affecting the membership of the new Independent State. When the framers of the Papua New Guinea Constitution referred to persons who had a right to permanent residence in Australia, part of the contextual background in which that reference was made was an Australian immigration law which, according to its terms, and as it was administered, denied people such as the applicant a right to permanent residence in Australia in the absence of a specific grant. That background explains the terms of s 64(4). 46 At [22]-[23] in Ex part Ame their Honours stated: At the time [ie in 1975], s 6(1) of the Migration Act provided that an immigrant who entered Australia without an entry permit was a prohibited immigrant. ... A right of permanent residence (in practice, a right to re-enter Australia free of the constraints of s 6) could be acquired by a person who was granted a permanent entry permit (s 15). ... The [Migration] Act applied, and was administered on the basis that it applied, to persons entering mainland Australia from external Territories. ... ...The right to permanent residence referred to in s 65(4)(a) is the same as the right referred to in s 64(4)(b), that is to say, the right which a small number of Papuans had received by grant, not a right which all Papuans had by virtue of birth in the Territory of Papua at a time when it was an external Territory of Australia. ... 47 Regulation 4 of the Papua New Guinea Independence (Australian Citizenship) Regulations (Cth) was plainly intended to allow the PNG Constitution to govern who became a citizen of Papua New Guinea on Independence Day. It provided, consistently with the PNG Constitution 's rejection in principle of dual citizenship, that a person who immediately before Independence Day was an Australian citizen and who became a citizen of Papua New Guinea on that day ceased on that day to be an Australian citizen. Subject to the retrospective, but for practical purposes, temporary, operation of the Papua New Guinea Independence (Australian Citizenship of Young Persons) Regulations (Cth), the effect of reg 4 of the Papua New Guinea Independence (Australian Citizenship) Regulations (Cth) was to deprive Mr Charlie of his Australian citizenship (see [15] above). 48 The contention that, as at Independence Day, Mr Charlie was a person who had a right of permanent residence in Australia within the meaning of s 65(4)(a) because he had the permission of the Darnley Island Council to reside on Darnley Island fails. 49 The above conclusion renders it unnecessary to determine whether Mr Charlie and his family were, for a period of time after his arrival on Darnley Island in 1975, prohibited immigrants within the meaning of the Migration Act as then in force. Even if it can be assumed that they were prohibited immigrants, and therefore technically subject to removal, it is clear that the Commonwealth did not at that time seek to implement the relevant provisions of the Migration Act in respect of persons residing on Darnley Island."
considered,SZGQM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 899,"Every case must individually be considered. Subject to that necessary qualification, the present case is comparable in some respects to SZGQM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 899 where an extension of time of one week was refused in circumstances where the explanation provided by the applicant was that he had "" forgot about it "". 17 Compliance with the Rules of Court, including the times within which applications are to be made, is normally to be expected. 18 No reason is shown in the present proceeding to extend the time by some 4 months."

In that case a coversheet together with a five page submission had apparently been forwarded by facsimile to the Refugee Review Tribunal in response to a s 424A letter under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) inviting comment on certain information, but only the cover sheet was received. Allsop J, as his Honour then was, held that it was a case where the Tribunal needed to see and should have inquired about the absence of the missing five page submission."
cited,Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd (1920) AC 102,"Accordingly, if the estimation of any part of the damages claimed by the bankrupt involves a reference to the bankrupt's rights of property, the common law exception adopted in the Bankruptcy Act and reflected in s 116(2)(g) , may not be enlivened. His Honour Dixon J also had regard to the decision of the House in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd (1920) AC 102 in which a bankrupt claimant, Major Wilson, was held entitled to maintain a claim for damages for defamation (personal injury to his credit and reputation) by reason of the bank's negligent management of Major Wilson's financial affairs whilst he was out of England engaged in war service during the course of the 1 st World War. That claim arose out of the same cause of action vested in the trustee of Major Wilson who properly maintained a claim for the benefit of the creditors for damages for economic loss due to the negligent management of Major Wilson's financial affairs."
referred to,Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273,"Finance Minister submits that procedural fairness does not require that every piece of information that might potentially be used adversely to another person's interest must be provided. Rather, the obligation to provide procedural fairness is limited. Reliance is placed upon the observations of McHugh J in Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 311-312 wherein his Honour observed (in his dissenting judgment): In the absence of a clear contrary legislative intention, those rules require a decision-maker ""to bring to a person's attention the critical issue or factor on which the administrative decision is likely to turn so that he may have an opportunity of dealing with it"". Footnotes omitted. His Honour's decision has been recently approved by McHugh and Gummow JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [81] - [83] . Whilst observing that not every adverse piece of information needs to be put, his Honour said at 629: Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made. See also Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [17] . In Teoh at 311 McHugh J (in dissent) said of the rules of procedural fairness: In the absence of a clear contrary legislative intention, those rules require a decision-maker 'to bring to a person's attention the critical issue or factor on which the administrative decision on which is likely to turn so that he may have an opportunity of dealing with it'. Footnotes omitted. The solicitors for the Finance Minister provided information which was incomplete because of the absence of the Issues paper containing the QTB summary. The information contained in the QTB summary referred to the Minister for Health's state of knowledge. Such knowledge was directly relevant to the applicants and because of the reference to controversy surrounding another pathology provider was potentially prejudicial to the applicants. In this sense, the information was personal to them; see Mason J in Kioa at 587. To similar effect, McHugh J in Teoh at 311-312 in his dissenting judgment said ' The question becomes, what does fairness require in all the circumstances of the case? ' The Court does not accept that the mere fact that the discretion granted under s 33 is broad and describes no procedure for its exercise has the consequence that natural justice absolved the Finance Minister from the requirement to furnish the applicants with the material upon which he would rely. Even if it did, it is not sufficient for the Finance Minister to give the applicants the impression they were in possession of all the material upon which he would rely when this was contrary to the fact. By purporting to comply with the applicants' request that they be furnished with all information, the Finance Minister is not entitled to claim that the operation of s 33 had the consequence that he did not have to furnish them with any material at all. In these circumstances fairness required that the QTB be provided: see McHugh J in Teoh at 311-312 as extracted in paragraph [62] of this judgment. Natural justice required that such document be put before the applicants to allow them an opportunity to respond to it before any decision was made under s 33. This is especially so in view of the repeated requests by the applicants that they be furnished with the exact material that would be relied upon to enable them to comment upon it. The failure to provide the summary to the applicants has resulted in a breach of the rules of natural justice. Ground 2 Failure to consider the totality of the applicants' claims The applicants submit that the Finance Minister failed to have regard or proper regard, to important integers of the applicants' claim, namely that the Health Minister wrote to the NSW Health Minister and that the Health Minister directed the HIC to write to all New South Wales medical practitioners to inform them of NATA's concerns ('the two integers')."

referred to,Spautz v Williams [1983] 2 NSWLR 506,"inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process was traditionally exercised to prevent its jurisdiction being used 'for a purpose other than that for which the proceedings are properly designed and exist' : see Spautz v Williams [1983] 2 NSWLR 506 at 539 per Hunt J. In Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Another [1988] FCA 450 ; (1988) 23 FCR 472 , Burchett J at 486-487 quoted his decision in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Edelsten (unreported, Burchett J, 10 March 1988) where his Honour, having reviewed the authorities said: These authorities unite in seeing as crucial the purpose for which the process is used. It is the illegitimacy of the purpose that makes the abuse."
applied,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1,"The definition of 'refugee' presents two cumulative conditions, the satisfaction of both of which is necessary for classification as a refugee. The first condition is that a person be outside the country of nationality 'owing to' fear of persecution for a relevant Convention reason, which is well-founded both in an objective and a subjective sense. The second condition is met if the person who satisfies the first condition is unable to avail himself or herself 'of the protection of' the country of nationality. This includes persons who find themselves outside the country of their nationality and in a country where the country of nationality has no representation to which the refugee may have recourse to obtain protection. The second condition also is satisfied by a person who meets the requirements of the first condition and who, for a particular reason, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality; that particular reason is that well-founded fear of persecution in the country of nationality which is identified in the first condition (per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Khawar at [61], cited with approval by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [16]. See also Chan Yee Kin v The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 ('Chan'), Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 ('Applicant A') at 283 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 ('S152') at [19]). 34 Where diplomatic or consular protection is available, a person must show, not merely that he is unwilling to avail himself of such protection, but that his unwillingness is owing to his fear of persecution. He must justify, not merely assert, his unwillingness. A claimant's unreasonable refusal to seek the protection of his home authorities would not satisfy the requirements of Art 1A(2) (per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ in S152 at [19]). 35 Because it is the primary responsibility of the country of nationality to safeguard fundamental human rights and freedoms, the international responsibility has been described as a form of 'surrogate protection'. 'Protection' in that sense has a broader meaning than the narrower sense in which the term is used in Art 1A(2) but, so long as the two meanings are not confused, it is a concept that is relevant to the interpretation of Art 1A(2) (per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ in S152 at [20]. See also per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [20])."

The first was R v Small Claims Tribunal and Homewood; Ex parte Cameron [1976] VR 427, which related to an extension of the scope of a claim for breach of contract based upon an alleged misrepresentation without the respondent to the proceedings having been given notice of the misrepresentation as the basis for that extended claim, and therefore having been extended an opportunity to meet that case. The second was Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5 ; (1943) 68 CLR 571, where there had occurred an omission, albeit inadvertent, to notify a debtor of an adjourned hearing date of a bankruptcy petition, and where an order for sequestration nevertheless was made.

The fourth was Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 ; (2003) 131 FCR 28 at [33] , where it was held that written notice of a hearing date did not reach an applicant for relief in time, and an incorrect recording of his telephone number had frustrated attempts to communicate with that person by telephone, and further that the tribunal decision-maker was unaware of the absence of notice of the hearing.

Thus, it is not a judgment which is subject to appeal by a person whose document has been rejected by the Registrar in accordance with a direction given by a Judge. 59 Paragraph 6 of the notice of motion seeking leave to appeal from Gordon J's orders in relation to the second notice of motion must be dismissed. 60 Paragraphs 7 and 10 of the notice of motion seem to assume that a judge of the Court has some sort of supervisory jurisdiction over another judge of the Court or at least the reasons published by another judge of the Court. Nothing could be further from the fact. The notion of the independence of the judiciary is fundamental to the system of justice in this country. It is not only that judges are independent of the Executive but each judge of the Court is independent of each other. It is important that judges are not subject to influences or pressures from their fellow judges so that each judge can give their judgment and their reasons freely. A judge's judgment and reasons are subject to scrutiny but only on appeal."
applied,Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69 ; (1998) 196 CLR 494,"52 of the Act proscribes a corporation from engaging in trade or commerce in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. Mr Rossetto and Bimbee claim that they have suffered, or are likely to suffer, loss or damage ' by conduct of ' Meriton in contravention of s 52 and may recover that loss or damage pursuant to s 82 or s 87 of the Act. The words ' by conduct of ' in ss 82 and 87 impose a causal requirement that the loss or damage claimed must be sustained ""by"" the contravention of s 52 ( Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69 ; (1998) 196 CLR 494 at [95] ; I &amp; L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at [50] and [54]). Mr Rossetto is not entitled to damages for the loss of an expectation of rental or profits unless reliance on the representations deprived him of the opportunity to enter into a different contract resulting in greater rental or profits ( Havyn Pty Ltd v Webster (2005) 12 BPR 22,837 at [117(g)]; Gates at 13 to 15; Marks at [48]). There is no pleading or evidence that, had Mr Rossetto not relied on the representations, he would have entered into a different contract and thereby made a profit. However, Mr Rossetto asserts in his written submissions that the evidence will be adduced to establish an opportunity foregone by reason of reliance on the representation, for which he is entitled to damages. Value of the premises Mr Rossetto has suffered no loss with respect to the value of the premises because what he bought was worth what he paid for it ( Marks at 514-5 per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ). There was no loss as a result of altering his position under the inducement of the misleading conduct ( Marks at 513-4). The damages alleged to have been suffered by Bimbee are particularised as: 'The loss of income being the reduction in the net income caused by [Bimbee] not operating the only child care centre in the World Tower building as represented to [Mr Rossetto] '. Bimbee's claim has been further particularised to include loss of income and goodwill. The former has been particularised as: &#8226; past loss of income, calculated as profit expected less actual profit received; and &#8226; future loss of income, as expected income assuming no competitor and a daily charge of $120 per child."
considered,Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union [1979] FCA 84 ; (1979) 42 FLR 331,"Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union [1979] FCA 84 ; (1979) 42 FLR 331 was a case under s 45D of the TPA concerning secondary boycotts. It was, in that case, necessary that the impugned conduct ""would have or be likely to have"" the relevant effect. Consideration was given to whether, on an ex post view, the specified effect had occurred. Deane J at 347 citing Dixon J in Willis v Commonwealth [1946] HCA 22 ; 73 CLR 105 explained: if conduct had run its ordinary course and had not had the specified effect, it would be but rarely that a court would feel justified in disregarding the lesson of the event and finding that while the conduct did not have the specified effect it had been more likely than not that it would have had that effect. Tillmanns [1979] FCA 84 ; 42 FLR 331 was referred to with apparent approval by Gzell J in ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) 256 ALR at [1068] although in relation to s 1041E of the Act where the test, whilst similar, is not the same. Materiality: a commercial judgment The question is whether the Informations was information for the purposes of s 674(2) read together with s 677 which would or would be likely to influence common investors in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities and thereby be information which a reasonable person would expect if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price of FMG's shares. The threshold of relevant influence is not, in my opinion, a high one. ASIC, in this case, says that expert assistance is unnecessary for the Court. Senior counsel for ASIC submits that the question of influence for the purposes of s 677 involves primarily a commonsense test for the Court upon a consideration of the primary facts although assistance may be derived from experts who professionally buy and sell shares in large tranches and make investment decisions of the kind contemplated by s 677. I accept this submission. ASIC submits that the fact or likelihood of relevant influence of the Informations is obvious having regard to the nature of this information which individually and together concerned a step forward about the construction of the Project infrastructure, which was integral to FMG's plans. ASIC says that if the three framework agreements were to lead, as both parties evidently intended, to binding build, finance and transfer type agreements, this would be a major advance as it would secure finance and a construction agreement for FMG's total estimated payout costs of $1.85 billion. It adds that the likely influence upon common investors of the Informations is a matter of common sense: it was information which was very significant for the Project and its prospects of being realised, as it was a step forward in arranging for the financing and construction of the rest of its Pilbara infrastructure. ASIC seems ambivalent as to the effect of the Framework Agreements. It says, on the one hand, that they are merely agreements to negotiate and are probably not even enforceable as such. Then on the question of materiality under s 674(2)(c)(ii) ASIC contends that they represent a ""major advance"" if the negotiations proved successful."

If the notice of appeal fails to disclose a question of law the necessary subject matter of the appeal is lacking. The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 248 ALR 456 at 465-468.

applied,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609,"The principal submission of the Minister however is that, assuming a breach of the Act in that the invitation cannot be said to have been duly sent to the still authorised recipient, in the circumstances of this case such failure cannot possibly have made any difference to the decision and the Court should, in its discretion, withhold relief. The case is to be distinguished from others such as: SZFOH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ( 2007) 159 FCR 199 where there had been no appearance by the applicant at the Tribunal's hearing; Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 159 FCR 181 where the failure to reply to a notice of invitation to comment allowed the Tribunal to proceed to make a decision without further invitation to the applicant; and Vean of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 311 ; (2003) 133 FCR 570 where the appellant did not receive the invitation until a considerable time after it had been sent to and received by the authorised recipient because it had been addressed to the applicant care of the authorised recipient. Because the appellant was in fact fully heard and the Tribunal rejected the veracity of his claims it is a case where the ""decision-maker was bound by the governing statute to refuse the application"": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [29] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ and separately Kirby J and Hayne J. 25 However, the decision in SZBYR 235 ALR 609 was given on 13 June 2007 shortly after the decisions in Lee 159 FCR 181 and SZFOH 159 FCR 199 and in my opinion SZBYR 235 ALR 609 now provides authoritative guidance. As succinctly put by counsel for the Minister, the appellants in SZBYR 235 ALR 609 argued that the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 424A of the Act in dealing with issue A, but the Tribunal had also relied on issue B which was in itself an independent ground for refusing their application. At [29], Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ said: The present is a case in which no useful result could ensue from the grant of the relief desired by the appellants. This is so because, even if the appellants be correct as to the proper operation of s 424A , they cannot overcome the tribunal's finding that their claims lacked the requisite convention nexus. The appellants' case, like Mobile Oil Canada Limited ... cited in [ Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex parte] Aala [(2000) [2000] HCA 57 ; 204 CLR 82 at [56] ], was one in which ""irrespective of any question of procedural fairness or individual merits, the decision-maker was bound by the governing statute to refuse"". (Footnotes omitted.) Hayne J likewise said at [91]: The Refugee Review Tribunal's finding that the appellants' claims lacked the requisite nexus with the Convention was inevitable. That being so, the appellants were not entitled to relief of the kind they sought. The discretion to grant that relief was to be exercised against them. (Footnotes omitted.) 26 Kirby J agreed that relief should be refused on discretionary grounds but on a narrower basis. His Honour took the view that ""issue B"" as counsel and I have called it, (the nexus issue in SZBYR 235 ALR 609) was on analysis the only reason for the Tribunal's decision and was sufficient. However, his Honour said at [87]-[89]: Once the foregoing conclusion became clear, it was immaterial ... to examine the extent of the default of the tribunal, if any, under section 424A ... Any such default could not have affected the decision of the tribunal for the reason that it accepted. An application for judicial review of that decision was therefore liable to dismissal on discretionary grounds. Discretionary refusal of judicial review must be exercised with care, particularly where the hypothesis of jurisdictional error is a possibility. However, in some such cases (of which this was one) invocation of the discretion is proper, prudent, economical and just. In effect, the discretion allows the reviewing court to say: The case is clear. A sound basis for the challenged decision has been established. Even if a postulated error has occurred in complying with s424A and could be proved, any such error is immaterial because it could not undermine the essential legal basis that sustains the decision. In that event, to divert the court's time and resources into examining a supposed technical breach is not a proper use of its energies. Nor is it required by the justice of the case. When such conclusions are reached, the reviewing court is entitled to, and should, reject the application in the exercise of its discretion. It should leave analysis of suggested technical infractions to a case where the result of such analysis might influence the outcome. This was not such a case. (Footnotes omitted.) 27 In my opinion those pungent observations of Kirby J are entirely applicable by way of analogy here. 28 Factors relevant to the exercise of discretion in this case are, it seems to me, first, the Tribunal's default was patently one of a mere clerical oversight rather than a studied misapplication of the law. Second, this is not a case where, simply, actual notice had also come to the attention of the appellant personally in his application before the Tribunal but there was no notice to any person authorised by him to be his desired recipient. Third, there was, in fact, notification to someone in whose understanding of the legal and practical implications of his litigious position the appellant had confidence. Fourth, here the appellant acted on that actual notice and in the event there was secured to him every right and opportunity of substance which s 441G envisaged for him. There was adequate and due notice of the hearing and an unmistakably clear and adequate opportunity to attend before the Tribunal and for him to put his case to it, all of which opportunities the appellant took up. 30 If my decision should not be in accord with Lee 159 FCR 181 and SZFOH 159 FCR 199, I believe any departure of mine from the reasoning in those cases is appropriate and warranted after SZBYR 235 ALR 609. I should add, however, that all the cases on exercise of discretion have to be closely examined in the light of their own facts. It is very easy to make remarks able to be read as nostrums for general application when really what the court is doing is seeking to explain the considerations which have weighed with it in the instant case. I have probably been guilty of the same thing here myself. I do not suggest that I would necessarily have decided Lee 159 FCR 181 or SZFOH 159 FCR 199 differently, even after SZBYR 235 ALR 609. Their facts are not these facts."

Nonetheless, I invited the parties to put on submissions as to costs. They did so voluminously, save for Mr Bell who indicated he would abide by the orders of the Court. Having considered the parties submissions and having reviewed the costs issues in light of what are well accepted principles that properly inform the exercise of my discretion under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), I am satisfied that to deny the successful respondents any costs at all would, in the circumstances, be punitive.

applied,"Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40 , 203 CLR 172","the powers of the Court on appeal can only be exercised if there be appellable error.

Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ there made the following observations in relation to the powers of a Court when entertaining an appeal by way of a rehearing (references omitted): For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error, whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error. At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance. And the critical distinction, for present purposes, between an appeal by way of rehearing and an appeal in the strict sense is that, unless the matter is remitted for rehearing, a court hearing an appeal in the strict sense can only give the decision which should have been given at first instance whereas, on an appeal by way of rehearing, an appellate court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and the law as they then stand. Although this was a case concerning the Family Court, s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is not materially different to the equivalent provision of the Family Law Act 1976 (Cth): Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 at [75] , [2001] HCA 17 ; 205 CLR 507 at 533 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J.

In dealing with s 82 , Lockhart J said at 529-530: Section 82 is the vehicle for the recovery of loss or damage for multifarious forms of contravention of the provisions of Pts IV and V of the Act. It is important that rules laid down by the courts to govern entitlement to damages under s 82 are not unduly rigid, since the ambit of activities that may cause contraventions of the diverse provisions of Pts IV and V is large and the circumstances in which damage therefrom may arise will vary considerably from case to case. What emerges from an analysis of the cases (and there are many of them) is that they do not impose some general requirement that damage can be recovered only where the applicant himself relies upon the conduct of the respondent constituting the contravention of the relevant provision. Also, a perusal of the provisions of Pts IV and V, the contravention of which gives rise to an entitlement to an applicant for compensation for loss or damage, points to the conclusion that applicants may claim compensation when the contravener's conduct caused other persons to act in a way that led to loss or damage to the applicant. Examples are s 46 which concerns the misuse of market power by corporations; s 47 relating to the practice of exclusive dealing; also s 48 which is concerned with resale price maintenance.

applied,Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc [2002] HCA 8 ; (2002) 209 CLR 95,"I have no doubt that, viewed objectively, the conduct of Mr Lewarne and Mr Scotts suggests that they intended their arrangements to have legal consequences and that a contract was made at the latest when Mr Lewarne paid his $300,000 to Mr Scotts; Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc [2002] HCA 8 ; (2002) 209 CLR 95 at 105-6. It is clear from Mr Dempsey's evidence that they intended to enter into an agreement that had been formally drawn by a solicitor. It may be that they envisaged that this could be done before they needed to commit to a binding arrangement and were prepared to consider the solicitor's advice as to how their relationship should be structured. It is equally clear in my view that this intention was overtaken by events. Mr Scotts' need for funds to meet the imminent settlement of the business purchase from Wellfox intervened. Although not legally sophisticated, both Mr Lewarne and Mr Scotts are experienced businessmen. The commercial nature of their activities, their conduct in advancing and receiving money and their active co-operation in the running of a business (discussed in more detail below) all point to them intending to enter into a binding contract; Edwards v Skyways Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 349 at 355; Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd [1994] 2 VR 106 at 177."
distinguished,Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1002,"4 r 14(2) of the Federal Court Rules provides: Except as provided by or under any Act, a corporation may not, without the leave of the Court, commence or carry on any proceeding otherwise than by a solicitor. Counsel for the parties referred me to the following authorities in relation to the approach to be taken on an application for leave under the rule: Tobacco Control Coalition Inc v Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd [2000] FCA 131 ( Tobacco Control ); Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1002 ( Checked-Out ); Silkearl Pty Ltd v Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd [2006] FCA 949 ( Silkearl ) and Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 985 ( Cytel ). I will return to these authorities below. In Checked-Out , Emmett J granted leave to the applicant to carry on the proceeding without a solicitor for the purpose of resisting certain motions for summary dismissal, and to be represented on the hearing of those motions by a named individual who was not a solicitor. However, his Honour declined to grant general leave for the company to carry on the proceeding without a solicitor, noting the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved as one reason militating against the grant of leave. The case is distinguishable on the same or a similar basis."
cited,Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476,"Nonetheless if the applicant's visa has been cancelled on the basis of a decision infected by jurisdictional error, the Court has jurisdiction to consider an application to have the decision quashed: Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476. 9 In this case the applicant has not framed his application in terms of judicial review of the Tribunal's decision, or sought to have that decision quashed pursuant to s 39B Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). However at the hearing the applicant applied for leave to have the errors of law raised in his draft notice of appeal deemed to be grounds for review. This application for leave was not opposed by the Minister and leave was granted. 10 The Tribunal identified the two issues in the application before it as: 1. Whether the applicant did not pass the character test in s 501(6)(a) because of his past and present criminal conduct and, if so 2. Whether the Tribunal should exercise its discretion to set aside or affirm the decision made by the delegate of the Minister to cancel the applicant's visa. 11 The background facts as found by the Tribunal may be summarised as follows: &#8226; The applicant was born in New Zealand in 1954 and first arrived in Australia in 1996. In New Zealand the applicant had accumulated a substantial criminal record. In all, he was sentenced to over 11 years imprisonment in New Zealand, not including sentences which were served concurrently. &#8226; On arrival in Australia the applicant was granted a special category visa class TY subclass 444. He did not, however, satisfy the requirements for an absorbed person visa under s 34(2) Migration Act . &#8226; His lengthy New South Wales criminal history commenced on 11 November 1997. On three separate occasions he has been sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 12 months or more. Nine of his more serious custodial sentences were confirmed on appeal and none appear to have been reversed or reduced. &#8226; On 6 June 2006 the applicant was convicted at Coffs Harbour District Court of the offence supplying a prohibited drug in an indictable quantity (not cannabis), for which he was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months. At the same time he was convicted of two counts of possessing a prohibited drug for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment, to be served concurrently. &#8226; On 1 February 2007 the applicant was notified of the Minister's intention to consider cancelling the applicant's visa under s 501(2) Migration Act . After considering the applicant's response, the delegate of the Minister made the decision to cancel the applicant's visa on 23 May 2007. 12 The Tribunal noted that, at the hearing before it, the applicant had had no access to writing material at the Brisbane City Watchhouse, and that he had had little time to prepare a statement for transmission to the Tribunal and the respondent. However the Tribunal also noted that at earlier telephone directions the applicant had been informed of the importance of ensuring that all witness statements were filed and served on time (at [24]). 13 The Tribunal observed that under s 501(2) Migration Act , the Minister may cancel a visa if the holder does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test (s 501(2)(a) and (b)). It is clear that the Minister retains a discretion as to whether the relevant visa should be cancelled. 14 Section 501(6) provides that a person does not pass the character test if, inter alia : (a) the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); or ... (c) having regard to either or both of the following: (i) the person's past and present criminal conduct; (ii) the person's past and present general conduct; the person is not of good character; or"

applied,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2003) 211 CLR 441,"It might also be noted that by s 351(7) , the Minister is empowered to make, by way of substitution, a more favourable decision, but that he does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise his power under subs (1) in respect of any decision, whether he was requested to do so by an applicant or another person, or in any other circumstances. That particular statutory provision and its analogues have the necessary consequence in relation to an application for a constitutional writ, in which it is sought to compel Ministerial consideration, that there is no statutory duty so to do and, hence, a constitutional writ will not go. See in that regard the High Court's decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 (2003) 211 CLR 441-48. 24 That in itself is enough to dispose of the proceeding on the basis of an absence of a reasonable prospect of success; i.e. there is no hope of establishing jurisdiction to entertain the claim in respect of relief relating to compelling the Minister to act under s 351. It is desirable though, in the circumstances, to reflect upon other aspects of the claim, even assuming that there were jurisdiction. 25 In their written submission the Respondents, apart from the primary submission which is that the Minister is under no obligation to consider a request, also in an elaborate way chart by way of reference to directions that have been given by the Minister pursuant to his administration of the Act and in relation to s 351, highlight how it is, that a particular course was taken within the Department to proceed as was done once both a request for withdrawal had been received and once there was an awareness of a continuing migration matter litigation. It suffices to note that there is a compelling basis for the submission that the course taken was one that was within power. The detail of that is set out in the submission which is on the court file and it is not necessary to elaborate on it."
cited,Waterford v The Commonwealth (1986-1987) 163 LR 54,"these circumstances, the answering of the questions posed in pars 2.10 and 2.11 of the notice of appeal is ultimately nothing to the point. Why that is so was explained in the following remarks made by Brennan J in Waterford v The Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1986-1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77: ""A finding by the AAT on a matter of fact cannot be reviewed on appeal unless the finding is vitiated by an error of law. Section 44 of the AAT Act confers on a party to a proceeding before the AAT a right of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia 'from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding' but only 'on a question of law'. The error of law which an appellant must rely on to succeed must arise on the facts as the AAT has found them to be or it must vitiate the findings made or it must have led the AAT to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make. There is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. "" (Emphasis added)"

considered,Currie v M'Knight [1896] AC 97,"In any event the plaintiffs may face substantial difficulty in seeking to establish their claims to maritime liens. They assert that their liens are for damage done to the vessels by the oil spillage. Such a lien is recognized by subs 15(2) of the Admiralty Act and in the textbooks and cases dealing with maritime liens. See, for example, Bankers Trust International Ltd v Todd Shipyards Corporation; ""The Halcyon Isle"" [1981] AC 221 at 232-233. However the circumstances in which a lien arises for ""damage done by a ship"" are limited. Currie v M'Knight [1897] AC 97 establishes that the damage must be ""the fault of the ship itself"", that is the ship against which liability is alleged. See also the observations of Lord Herschell at 108 and Lord Morris at 109-110. In ""The Eschersheim "" [1976] 1 WLR 430 at 438 Lord Diplock applied the decision in Currie v M'Knight in construing a statutory provision similar to para 4(3)(a) of the Admiralty Act . The facts of that case were similar to those in the present actions. In Opal Maritime Agencies Pty Ltd v Proceeds of Sale of Vessel MV ""Skulptor Konenkov "" [2000] FCA 507 ; (2000) 172 ALR 481 , the Full Court applied "" The Eschersheim "", although in a somewhat different context. These cases might suggest that in the present case, the damage caused by the tug was not damage done by Global Peace which would give rise to such maritime liens. However it is not necessary to take the matter any further."
referred to,Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 70,"There was no need in this case for the Minister to go through a list of factors that might have informed her conclusion with regard to Mr Yalniz's children. Sometimes this may be appropriate but in other cases it may be sufficient, as in this case, to adopt an approach that assumes the relevant factors point to one conclusion that it will be in the best interests of children to remain with their parents: compare Sebastian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 31 at [15] per Tamberlin, Kiefel and Emmett JJ; Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 70 at [20] - [22] per Nicholson, Jacobson and Lander JJ; and Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 221 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ and 238 per Kirby J. The fact that she did not make a list of factors (e.g., hardship and children's development) does not in this case make good the proposition that she did not direct her mind to the matters that arose on the information before her. Having regard to what I have already stated, I think it plain enough that she discharged her obligation fully in this regard."
cited,Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674,"Commonwealth contended that AWB had failed in its attempt to prove legal professional privilege because it had not adduced any proof as to AWB's dominant purpose in seeking or obtaining legal advice. AWB largely relied upon evidence given by in-house and external lawyers involved in the particular communications at issue. The Commonwealth submitted that evidence proving the lawyer's understanding of the purpose of the particular communication and that he or she was giving legal advice affords no evidence of the client's dominant purpose. There is no real substance in this criticism. Dominant purpose must be determined objectively, but it is not uncommon for the relevant purpose to be established by evidence given by the maker of the statement or another person responsible for commissioning the relevant document or bringing it into existence, such as a solicitor: see Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria WorkCover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 at [14] ; Grant v Downs at 677 and AWB v Cole at [110]."
cited,Helvering v Gregory (1934) 69 F (2d) 809,"Nevertheless, context is important. The significance of context was articulated well by Learned Hand J, first in Helvering v Gregory (1934) 69 F (2d) 809 at 810: It is quite true...that as the articulation of a statute increases, the room for interpretation must contract; but the meaning of a sentence may be more than that of the separate words, as a melody is more than the notes, and no degree of particularity can ever obviate recourse to the setting in which all appear, and which all collectively create. And also in Cabell v Markham (1945) 148 F (2d) 737 at 739: ...of course it is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of any writing: be it a statute, a contract or anything else. But it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning."
applied,Re United Medical Protection Limited (2003) ACSR 705,"relevant principles governing the making of an order pursuant to s 482(1) are well settled and were summarised by Austin J in Re United Medical Protection Limited (2003) ACSR 705 at [30]. His Honour said: As to termination of a winding up, I was taken to Re Data Homes Pty Ltd (in liq) [1972] 2 NSWLR 22 at 26-7; Re Mascot Homes Furnishers Pty Ltd [1970] VR 593 at 598 and Mercy &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Wanari Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 756 ; (2000) 35 ACSR 70 at [47] - [51] . Those cases show that in considering an application to terminate a court-ordered winding up under s 482 , the court has regard to the effect of the proposal on various categories of interests: the interests of creditors (including future creditors who might be prejudiced if the company is released from winding up in an encumbered state); the interests of the liquidator, particularly with respect costs; the interests of contributories; and the public interest (including the public interest in upholding commercial morality), the court taking the initial approach that insolvent companies should be wound up. I have taken the matters referred to by his Honour into account in considering whether to make an order terminating the winding-up of the Defendant. Subject to having its debt and the costs of the winding up proceedings paid, the Plaintiff consents to an order terminating the winding up of the Defendant. The Plaintiff has acknowledged that the debt has been paid. Likewise, subject to his costs of the winding up being paid, the Liquidator consents to such an order. There is also evidence before me that the Australian Securities Investment Commission has been notified of the application to terminate the winding up and that it does not wish to be heard in relation to that application. As to the public interest, I am satisfied that there are no public interest considerations that weigh against making an order terminating the winding up. I do not intend to imply that there are no ongoing issues to do with the management and records of the Defendant that still need to be attended to by the directors. I think there are. However, in my opinion these should be left to the directors of the Defendant and its newly appointed auditor."
applied,"Mazhar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 , 183 ALR 188","When appearing before the Tribunal, s 39 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act provides that the Tribunal is to "" ensure that every party ... is given a reasonable opportunity to present his ... case "".

applied,Elders Trustee and Executor Co Ltd v E G Reeves Pty Ltd (1987) 78 ALR 193,"I would also note, because of their present relevance, the observations of Gummow J in Elders Trustee and Executor Co Ltd v E G Reeves Pty Ltd (1987) 78 ALR 193 at 241: ""It is, of course, fundamental that s 52 is not designed for the benefit of persons who fail, in the circumstances of the case, to take reasonable care of their own interests ..."" 213 To anticipate what I will say, while the nature of the representations made by Bell and Sladojevic were likely to induce reliance, any inference that the applicants acted on those representations is negatived in the circumstances of this case. I am satisfied that those representations played no part in their decision to invest. I regard the evidence given to the contrary by Parker, Lee and Murabito as unreliable. In each of their cases it reflected at best reconstruction and rationalisation resulting in the creation of a collective memory. Their decision was one in which Parker was influential. They backed their own judgment as to the prospects for the Tiltform technology and Tiltform Australia. In so doing they assumed a risk that adequate working capital would be secured and the short term cash flow problem overcome. They did not rely upon Bell or Sladojevic. They knew, or ought to have known, through Parker, that Bell's ""$2 million"" had not been raised. Their investment decision was not relevantly influenced by Sladojevic' s 7 August letter. 214 I have, in outlining the evidence for the misleading or deceptive conduct claims, referred not only to the context in which those representations were to be evaluated for the purpose of determining their falsity or otherwise but also to the context in which their causative significance is to be judged. The following are my reasons for the conclusion I have foreshadowed. 215 There are five matters of general significance to which reference should be made at the outset as they bear in various ways on the resolution of the present question. First, the relevant events occurred over a relatively short period, i.e. from 2 June to 9 August, and at a time when both Tiltform Australia was in its infancy and the national licence system had not been established. Secondly, the contact between Parker and Lee on the one hand and Bell and Sladojevic on the other in this period was quite limited. Less so the contact between Lee, though not Parker, and Benson. Thirdly, all of the above persons, it can be inferred, were aware that in order to succeed Tiltform Australia would have to have sufficient working capital to address both licence fees and investment in formwork. The licence agreements and the disclosure documents made this clear. Thirdly, there was at the above time a considerable level of enthusiasm being demonstrated for the Tiltform technology, its use in the construction industry and in its profit making potential. Bell and Sladojevic and the WA investors exhibited that enthusiasm. Fourthly, the clear inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the climate in which the negotiations occurred for the WA investment in Tiltform Australia was one in which buoyant expectations were entertained that working capital would be forthcoming. Dawkins advent as ""chairman"" of Tiltform Australia in late July clearly provided some stimulus to this. Fifthly, the WA investment was made in Tiltform Australia which at the time was, and was known by the WA investors to be, Benson's and his joint venture partner Dr Abraham's company. No investment was being made in Tiltform Licensing. Neither Bell nor Sladojevic held offices in, or were shareholders of, Tiltform Australia although as I will later indicate a claim is brought against them as promoters of that company. 216 It is clear that, from the outset, the directors of the Icon Group Murabito, Palmiero and Lee made their own highly positive business judgment of the virtue and attractions of the Tiltform technology, of its profit making potential and of the advantage of acquiring a licence of it. When Parker was offered participation in the investment opportunity Tiltform WA, he in turn came to share the same positive attitude to the Tiltform ""opportunity"" after his initial meeting in Adelaide on 2 June with Sladojevic and Bell an attitude contributed to significantly by Sladojevic's explanations etc of the technology. I need not repeat here my findings on that meeting other than to say I do not consider that Parker's projections were discussed in detail with Bell at that meeting, though there was discussion of them. The collective decision of the WA investors to accept the offer of shares in Tiltform WA within ten days of Parker's return from the 2 June meeting provides some evidence, in my view, of their faith in the Tiltform technology."
followed,InterTAN Inc v DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 54,"These principles, as articulated in Colgate-Palmolive , are well known and were recently reinforced by the Full Court of the Federal Court in InterTAN Inc v DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 54 at [11] . The categories of cases I have listed are not closed. The Court clearly has wide discretion under s 43 Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order costs in any particular matter. In this particular case I am not persuaded that the circumstances of the case are such as to warrant a departure from the usual practice of the Court in awarding party to party costs so far as the costs of the respondent are concerned. There is no evidence before me that this case exhibits special or unusual features so as to justify the Court exercising its discretion so as to award indemnity costs. Further, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to attend on numerous occasions there is no evidence before me that the applicant's case against the respondent was ""hopeless"" or had no chance of success, or that the applicant's case was not based on evidentiary or factual foundations."

cited,Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor [1937] HCA 45 ; (1937) 58 CLR 479,"Nine submits that, were it to create and publish a daily schedule consisting only of time and title information, that would be a copyright protected compilation under the Act. However, that is not what the Weekly Schedule is. The Act provides for the subsistence of copyright in compilations of information, not mere information per se. The fact that copyright may subsist in the Weekly Schedule as a whole does not mean that it attaches to the individual facts referred to or the component parts therein ( Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor [1937] HCA 45 ; (1937) 58 CLR 479 per Latham CJ at 498 and Dixon J at 511). 42 Nine accepts that a proper identification of the copyright work takes account of the way in which the copyright owner packages or presents its work. Nine submits, however, that the identification must take account of the way in which Nine knows the work is going to be delivered to the consumer. Nine relies upon the fact that the published Aggregated Guides, in print and electronically, discard or hide synopses to varying degrees, while the time and title information always appears. It submits that its intention is that the Weekly Schedule ' be published [by the Aggregators] with primary emphasis on the time and title information, and on a daily basis, especially in the digital environment '. However, the fact that a reader may make use of a part of the compilation does not of itself change the nature of the copyright which subsists in the Weekly Schedule an original literary work. That compilation, as supplied to the Aggregators, is not limited to time and title. Nor is it limited to just one day of the relevant broadcast week. 43 Each of the sets of information contained in the Weekly Schedule, including the days in the broadcast week, the additional program information and the synopses, are a part of that compilation. The purpose of the Weekly Schedule is to impart the totality of that information to the Aggregators and, in turn, the public. Nine's operational activities are, as Ms Wieland agreed, ' geared to [a] week to week basis '. The Weekly Schedule, built up each week by Mr Healy and Ms Wieland, inevitably includes the synopses and the additional program information. These, in turn, are an integral part of the relationship between the information in and the design of the Weekly Schedule. The Weekly Schedule is the only relevant work to leave Nine. It is the work sent to the Aggregators. It is, with all of the information it includes, the way in which Nine, for good commercial reasons, presents the collocation of information. The totality of the information there included is necessary because it is required by the Aggregators and is also provided to the Aggregators by Nine's competitors for the purposes of the Aggregated Guides that are made available to the public. 178 Infringement is not necessarily avoided where material is simply checked with the data subject for verification or where the arrangement is different ( Waterlow Publishers Ltd v Rose (1989) 17 IPR 493 cited in Desktop at [346] per Sackville J). However, the concept that the taking of a single line of a directory for the purpose of saving labour and trouble amounts to an infringement was a ' famous but excessive admonition ' ( Desktop at [405] per Sackville J referring to Kelly at 701 2 per Sir W Page Wood VC). The fact that copyright may exist in a compilation does not mean that it exists in the individual facts referred to therein ( Victoria Park at 498 per Latham CJ and at 511 per Dixon J). The taking of line of a directory will not be sufficient for infringement if it does not constitute a substantial part (s 14(1) of the Act; Waterlow Directories Ltd v Reed Information Services Ltd (1990) 20 IPR 69 per Aldous J at 73, cited in Desktop at [347] per Sackville J). However, copyright in a compilation may be infringed by appropriating ' an undue amount of the material, although the language employed be different or the order of the material be altered ' (Laddie H, Prescott P, Vitoria M, Speck A and Lane L, The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs (3 rd ed, 2000) at paras 3.88 and 3.90, cited in Desktop at [375] per Sackville J). 182 Where the manner of presentation is the basis for the attraction of copyright, it may be that a presentation of the same information in different form would not infringe ( Victoria Park per Dixon J at 511). In such circumstances there may not have been a taking of a ""substantial part"", which is assessed by reference to the quantity and the quality of what is taken and the inter-relationship between them ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [70] per Lindgren J, cited in Gold Peg at [170]). It is a question of fact and degree (Crennan J in Gold Peg at [190]; also emphasised by McHugh and Kirby JJ in dismissing an application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court in Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2005] HCATrans 842). A defendant may rework the work of a plaintiff, capturing the ideas used or facts referred to but in a way that does not infringe because it is not a substantial reproduction. It may constitute a new original work. The taking of a substantial part of a copyright work will vary depending on the nature of the work and the degree of originality of the original work ( Skybase at 532 per Hill J, with whom French J agreed). The ' originality of that part of the work taken by the alleged infringer ' is critical ( Desktop at [409] per Sackville J). 184 The underlying principle is that the law of copyright does not give an exclusive right to state or describe particular facts ( Victoria Park at 498 per Latham CJ). Substantial reproduction and causal connection are separate and cumulative requirements for a finding of infringement ( Desktop at [399] per Sackville J). If a causal connection is shown, it is then necessary to assess whether the allegedly infringing work can fairly be said to be so sufficiently similar to the first that it is but a reproduction ( Skybase at 533 per Hill J, with whom French J agreed). While copying is an essential element in providing the requisite causal connection between the copyright work and the alleged infringement, copying does not, of itself, determine whether or not there has been the taking of a substantial part. Not every act of copying is an infringement of copyright. It is also necessary to establish the appropriate subject matter for copyright, what is original and whether there has been a taking of a substantial part ( Network Ten [2004] HCA 14 ; 218 CLR 273 at [14] [17] per McHugh A-CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ). 187 If each ""sliver"" or element of the Nine compilation is entitled to copyright protection, Ice accepts that it cannot defend these proceedings. Ice submits that a piece of information about, for example, a change in episode sequence is not a copyright protected work but ' at best, a tiny star in the galaxy of a compilation '. This accords with Victoria Park . Nine accepts that a single ""sliver"" of information, such as the programming over five days at 8 pm, does not amount to a substantial part of the Weekly Schedule nor of the Aggregated Guides. 188 The Aggregated Guides publish a substantial part of the information set out in the Weekly Schedule. Nine retains copyright in the Weekly Schedule. The skill and labour invested in a compilation may continue to be protected even where that compilation is integrated into or extended to become a different compilation which is itself protected by copyright. Nine asserts that the Aggregators' publication is as a ' sub-publisher ' of the Weekly Schedule, authorised by Nine. Nine contends that, in updating its guide by reference to the Aggregated Guides, Ice is taking a substantial part of its copyright work. 189 The IceGuide does not replicate the content or form of the Aggregated Guides. The differences in content are primarily in the additional program information and the synopses. Those sets of information from the Weekly Schedule are not necessarily replicated in the Aggregated Guides. For example, synopses are edited and may be shortened. Importantly, the Aggregated Guides also contain information from the Late Change Notices. That information is not included in the Weekly Schedule sent to the Aggregators. The form and arrangement of the IceGuide is different to that of the Aggregated Guides and different, in turn, to the form and arrangement of the Weekly Schedule. Accordingly, neither the content nor the format of the Weekly Schedule is replicated in the IceGuide."

discussed,Re Mincom Ltd (2007) 25 ACLC 163,"In Re Mincom Ltd (2007) 25 ACLC 163, Fryberg J described (at [39]) a deemed warranty clause almost identical to the present one as: onerous, unreasonable and calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a state of breach of warranty. As will be clear from what I have said above, I respectfully disagree. At first blush the deemed warranty may appear to attract criticism along these lines, but I think the criticism disappears once it is appreciated that its purpose and effect are as I have described them. Perhaps a better way of framing the provision would have been to avoid the language of warranty, and, instead, to provide simply that if shares continue to be subject to encumbrances after transfer, the shareholder would, upon demand by INMAL, pay the amount required to discharge the encumbrance to the encumbrancee if the encumbrance remains outstanding, or to INMAL if INMAL had already discharged it. 63 On the hearing I indicated that I would require the attention of Scheme participants to be drawn to the existence of the deemed warranty in the Scheme by a specific mention of it in section 2.4 (""Assessment of the Scheme"" ""Other Relevant Considerations"") of the Scheme Booklet. Accordingly, a new cl 2.4(c) will state: Deemed warranty Shareholders' attention is drawn to the warranties that Scheme Participants will be deemed to have given, if the Scheme takes effect, in clause 3.4 of the Scheme (see page 283)."
discussed,Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618,"respondent's submission that, in a patent infringement case such as this, where the validity of the patent is challenged, the practice of the court is to refuse an interlocutory injunction depended on Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 623-624. In Beecham , Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ referred (at 623) to ""the special considerations which generally arise in a patent action where there is a substantial issue to be tried as to the validity of the patent"". Their Honours (at 623-624) said: [T]he plaintiff's prima facie case must be a strong one so far as the question of validity is concerned, for he asserts a monopoly and must give more proof of the right he claims than is afforded by the mere granting of the patent ... The general practice in that kind of case has long been to refuse an interlocutory injunction unless either the patent has already been judicially held to be valid or it has stood unchallenged for a long period ... In Genrx (73 IPR at 503-504 [2]-[6]), Gyles J again considered the ongoing significance of Beecham for the grant of interlocutory injunctions in cases of alleged patent infringement. As his Honour observed, after American-Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 , there was a good deal of discussion about the importance of apparent differences between American-Cyanamid and Beecham . His Honour continued (at 503 [4]): The most influential consideration of the issue in relation to patents was that by Gummow J in Martin Engineering Co v Trison Holdings Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 543 ; 11 IPR 611. In the course of that judgment his Honour pointed out that the authorities referred to by the High Court in Beecham Group for not attributing great significance to the grant of a patent were old cases from England based upon a different system for grant than that which had developed in Australia by that time. The system of examination of patents prior to grant in Australia was more stringent than had been the case in England the century before. The practical effect of this decision was to give greater weight to the grant of a patent thereafter than might have been deduced from Beecham Group . Gyles J rejected a submission to the effect that the decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 had restored the authority of Beecham in this regard. His Honour noted, correctly in my view, that the reaffirmation of Beecham by the High Court in O'Neill concerned the elucidation of what is required for a prima facie case (or serious question to be tried). The applicants submitted that the respondent got itself into this situation with its eyes wide open. As noted above, Ms Evans' evidence was that representatives of Shenzhen Ant had said that there were no patents that would cause any issue for the respondent in selling syringes in Australia. The applicants argued that the respondent ought to have checked the position for itself. That is, the respondent has offered for sale or sold the syringes in the knowledge that they were the subject of a patent, or in circumstances where the respondent should have known of the patent. A consideration of this kind has been weighed in the balance of convenience from time to time: see Beecham 118 CLR at 626; Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405 at 415; Pharmacia Italia SpA v Interpharma Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 397 at 408 [52]; Interpharma 79 IPR at 282 [77]; and Sigma Pharmaceuticals [2009] FCA 595 at [61] - [62] . There would indeed appear to be some force in the applicants' criticism of the respondent's conduct in this regard. The evidence on this point is slight, however, and I would not therefore be inclined to give this factor much weight in determining the outcome of the applicants' interlocutory injunction application."
applied,Carnell v Mann (1998) 89 FCR 247,"Full Court of this Court in Carnell v Mann (1998) 89 FCR 247 at 254 held that pursuant to ss 118 and 119 , originals and copies are equally protected subject to the privilege being lost for one of the reasons set out in the succeeding sections of the Act. The second e-mail was merely an electronic means of delivering a copy of the first e-mail to Mr Anderson. Alternative means could have been employed by EP. A photocopy of the first e-mail could have been sent by mail or hand delivered or sent by facsimile transmission. Each method is to the same effect: a copy of the original privileged communication would have been delivered to Mr Anderson. The language of s 118(a) is directed to prohibiting evidence being adduced that would result in disclosure of a confidential communication made between a client and a lawyer. To allow, for example, cross-examination of Mr Drummond, by senior counsel for Euroz, utilising the second e-mail, would inevitably result in evidence being adduced which would result in the disclosure, in whole or part, of the privileged communication in the first e-mail. This reflects the position at common law as noted by the Full Court in Carnell v Mann at 254 when their Honours observed: In principle, whether copies of original documents are privileged at common law should be determined by asking what was the purpose underlying the creation of those original documents , and not what was the purpose underlying the creation of the copies see Carlton Cranes Ltd v Consolidated Hotels Ltd [1988] 2 NZLR 555 at 557 per Tompkins J. ... The better view, we think, is that, at common law, the mere act of copying a privileged document does not lead to loss of privilege in the copy simply because it was not created for a privileged purpose. In an era where so many documents are routinely copied, it would be peculiar to think that the existence of legal professional privilege in any given copy might depend upon the purpose underlying the making of that specific copy. (Emphasis added) It cannot be said that there was an express obligation. However, the circumstances, in my opinion, give rise to an implied obligation upon Mr Anderson, viewed objectively, not to disclose the contents of the first e-mail contained in the second e-mail. It may be seen that such an obligation need not be one which ""arises under law"" by virtue of s 117(1). As the Court said in Carnell v Mann at 259 the Parliament must have had in mind relationships broader than those of (for example) solicitor/client when it enacted the definitions of ""confidential communication"", and ""confidential document"" in s 117(1). The very content of the first e-mail which was copied in the second e-mail disclosed on its face, so far as Mr Drummond, objectively, might have considered, that it related to legal proceedings, actual or anticipated involving EP, Mr Bruce Drummond as one of its directors and inferentially Mr Graham Anderson as a potential witness or at least someone who might be in a position to assist in various ways with that litigation. Again, self-evidently, the first e-mail was addressed to at least one person at Slater &amp; Gordon, a well-known Australian legal firm. It included information concerning the private financial affairs of EP. Furthermore, the second e-mail in the section directed to Mr Anderson shows the subject as ""FW: Addition to witness statement"". Accordingly, it was being sent and must be taken to have been received in the context of, at least, anticipated litigation. In my opinion, it is inconceivable that EP and Mr Anderson would have considered the communication of the second e-mail to be other than on a strictly confidential basis. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the relationship between EP and Mr Anderson was of a confidential nature. In addition to the other matters which I have mentioned such is the case generally as between a client and the client's accountant. I do not mention these matters with a view to attributing any particular purpose but rather to characterise the confidential nature of the communication. This is not to say that the purpose of the communication may not be relevant to the question whether it was a confidential communication but merely that it is neither necessary to nor determinative of the resolution of the question."
cited,Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 46 ; (1990) 170 CLR 649,"It can be seen from these provisions that the powers of the Commissioner are wide-ranging. They comprehend an administrative power both under the ITTA 36 and the TAA to examine the conduct of a taxpayer to determine whether a taxpayer has, according to law, accurately identified the taxable income upon which tax is levied. In undertaking that examination or investigation for the purposes of the ITAA 36, ITAA 97 or the TAA, the Commissioner may exercise express powers such as those contained in ss 263 and 264 . The general administration of the legislation also comprehends a power to examine the conduct of a taxpayer not just to determine whether an assessment or an amended assessment issued by the Commissioner in reliance upon self assessment details supplied by the taxpayer is, in the light of proper analysis or audit (see Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 46 ; (1990) 170 CLR 649 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ), an accurate assessment of the taxpayer's liability to tax for the purposes of Part III but also whether the taxpayer has engaged in conduct which constitutes the commission of an offence against a tax law or a tax-related offence including offences against the Criminal Code and in particular, ss 134.4, 134.2, 135.1, 135.2 and 135.4 being an offence that relates to a liability to the Commonwealth arising under or by virtue of, a tax law."
applied,"Freeman v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1988) 19 FCR 342","Authority submitted that there is a clear line of authority that in cancellation cases, such as the present, a review Tribunal is required to have regard to the circumstances at the time of the decision and not those that followed it: Freeman v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1988) 19 FCR 342; Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (1992) 39 FCR 225; Nong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1575 ; (2000) 106 FCR 257; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sharma [1999] FCA 31 ; (1999) 90 FCR 513; and Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Kenna Investments Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 843 ; (2004) 138 FCR 428. The respondent submitted that the 'clear line of authority' referred to by the Authority, beginning with the decision of Davies J in Freeman , in support of the submission that the correct point in time is the time of the decision under review, is not directly relevant to the present question and can be distinguished because those authorities relate to different legislative provisions. The respondent analysed the reasoning of the Court in Freeman . That case, it was said, is commonly cited as authority for the proposition that the relevant point in time at which the Tribunal is to determine a person's entitlement will differ, depending upon whether the decision under review was a decision refusing to grant an entitlement or whether it was one cancelling an existing entitlement. Where the decision is to refuse an entitlement, the point in time is the date of the Tribunal's decision, and where the decision is to cancel an entitlement, the Tribunal is limited to considering the state of affairs as it existed on the date of the decision under review. The respondent submitted that critical to the Court's reasoning in Freeman was that in that case the Tribunal had affirmed the decision under review to cancel the applicant's pension. This meant that 'no further matter [remained] for the Tribunal's consideration' (at 345) and any entitlement of the applicant for a further pension would only 'revive' when a fresh application for a pension had been made (at 345, 346). The respondent submitted that Freeman should not be taken as authority for any general principle that administrative decisions may be categorized either as 'cancellation' decisions or 'refusal' decisions, to which vastly different regimes of review are applicable. If it does, then it was respectfully submitted that it was wrong and should not be followed. It was submitted that any attempt to apply such a universal categorisation to 'cancellations' and 'refusals' merely distracts from the primary question, which is to identify the issues required under the particular legislation. The question here, according to the respondent, should therefore focus on whether s 303(1)(f) itself 'fixes a point in time'. The respondent submitted that there is nothing in s 303(1)(f) of the Act to suggest that the point in time for the determination of the fitness and integrity issue is to be limited to the date of the Authority's decision, and that the Tribunal is not entitled to take account of developments which have occurred up until the date of the Tribunal's decision. The respondent said: 'Indeed, a consideration of the provision suggests that the point in time should be the situation as it has developed by the time of the Tribunal's decision.' The respondent pointed out that the present case was, of course, factually different from Freeman, in that here the Tribunal set aside the Authority's decision to cancel the respondent's registration and substituted it with a decision to caution the respondent subject to conditions, whereas in Freeman the Tribunal had affirmed the decision to cancel the applicant's pension, so that 'no further matter [remained] for the Tribunal's consideration' . In Freeman, therefore, any entitlement of the applicant for a further pension would 'revive' only when a fresh application for a pension had been made. Here the decision had been set aside ab initio , so that the parties were placed in the position that they would have occupied had the decision never been made, so that the respondent had the benefit of the extant decision granting him registration: See Secretary, Department of Social Security v O'Connell (1992) 38 FCR 540, 549 550. The Tribunal therefore remained a part of the 'continuum' of the administrative decision-making process, and there was no impediment to it determining what were the appropriate orders to be made, as at the date of the Tribunal's decision. The respondent submitted that the only specific complaint made by the Authority as to 'irrelevant' evidence taken into account by the Tribunal, related to the respondent's 'current practice' and his 'current success rate'. When considered in the context of all the evidence before the Tribunal, both of these pieces of evidence were relevant either because they related to events that occurred before the cancellation decision, or they were after-acquired evidence. The respondent submitted that, on any view of s 303(1)(f) , the Tribunal was therefore entitled to take account of the evidence referred to as the respondent's 'current practice' and his 'current success rate' in relation to the cancellation decision. In addition, the respondent submitted that whether or not the Tribunal was entitled to take the after-acquired evidence into account in relation to the cancellation decision, it was undoubtedly required to take it into account in relation to the suspension decision and the two refusal decisions. On the Authority's case and the authority of Freeman , the point in time for those decisions would have been the date of the Tribunal's decision. Given that the Tribunal gave a joint decision on all four decisions under review, it was not possible for the Authority to establish with any degree of probability that the evidence of the respondent's 'current practice' and his 'current success rate' was necessarily taken into account in relation to the cancellation decision. The respondent noted that at no time during the Tribunal's hearing did the Authority object to the reception of the evidence relating to respondent's 'current practice' and his 'current success rate'. It was put that this may be relevant to the issue of costs should the Authority succeed in this appeal. The Authority submitted that in Freeman the issue for determination by the Tribunal was whether the decision to cancel on the date of the original cancellation was the correct or preferable decision, not whether the applicant was entitled to a benefit at the time of the Tribunal's decision. The Authority submitted that that is the same in this case. The question for the Tribunal was whether its cancellation decision in July 2003 was the correct or preferable decision, not whether the respondent might be eligible to be registered in September 2005. In Freeman , Davies J indicated that it is important to have regard to the nature of the decision. The distinction his Honour saw as critical was between: a decision to refuse to grant a pension or benefit where there was an ongoing entitlement, which can be seen as part of a continuum; and a decision to cancel a pension made on a particular date. A decision of this kind has no ongoing nature, once made it is spent. Davies J noted that, under the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth), once a benefit is cancelled it may only be paid again following a fresh application. That is also the position in the present legislative context. Where a migration agent has had his registration cancelled, he would need to apply for registration afresh and cannot make such an application for five years (s 292). In this sense, the present case is even stronger than that considered by Davies J in Freeman . Davies J noted that a further distinction between entitlement decisions and cancellation decisions is that in the former case but not the latter the Tribunal can decide entitlement throughout the relevant continuum up to its decision. This is not possible in cancellation cases because if the cancellation decision was correct or preferable, there is no further step. That is also the position here (and probably in all cancellation cases). The Authority noted that the respondent had sought to distinguish this case on the basis that the legislation is different. However, the Authority argued, no material difference was identified. The only difference is the one noted above and it tends to show that this case is even more clear cut than that in Freeman . It was also observed that the power to cancel pensions in the Social Security Act was not restricted to being exercised at some point in time. This, it was said, was not part of Davies J's analysis, contrary to the respondent's submissions. The Authority noted that the Full Court in Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs approved the analysis of Davies J in Freeman (at 234.5). In that case, the legislation tied the primary decision-maker to a small period of time after certain rule changes were notified. The Court found that the Tribunal faced the same question as the primary decision-maker, which required it to look at the time the original decision should have been made. The legislation in that case is different from that in the present. However, the Authority submitted, the core principle is that the Tribunal must answer the same question as was answered by the primary decision-maker. For the reasons given by Davies J in Freeman , in a cancellation case, that involves whether the decision to cancel on the actual date of the cancellation was the correct or preferable decision. The Authority observed that this analysis was also endorsed and applied by Weinberg J in Sharma at 524 526 [61] [63] and, in the context of review of a decision to cancel a visa under the Act, by Katz J in Nong (albeit through reference to Weinberg J in Sharma , who applied Freeman ) at [29] [31]: '[29] As I understood the submission, at least in the form in which it appeared in Mr Nong's written outline of submissions filed in advance of the hearing before me, it was that the MRT had erred in not concluding that, on 6 January 2000, the date of its decision, Mr Nong was in compliance with condition 8202. [30] That submission may be dealt with quite briefly. [31] The MRT was not concerned, in making its decision, with the issue whether Mr Nong was or was not in compliance with condition 8202 on 6 January 2000, the date of its own decision. Rather, it was concerned with the issue whether Mr Nong had or had not been in compliance with condition 8202 on 30 March 1999, the date of the delegate's decision: see, for example, the discussion of the nature of the review function of the MRT's predecessor in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sharma [1999] FCA 31 ; (1999) 90 FCR 513 at 524-526 [61] - [63] (Weinberg J). (Emphasis added.)' The Authority observed that in Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency , Branson J considered that only limited assistance was gained from categorising decisions as cancellation decisions or entitlements decisions (at [26]). Her Honour considered that it was necessary to consider the nature of the decision involved. In that case, the Tribunal was to review a decision to vary the period of accreditation for an aged care provider (this decision did not fit readily into the cancellation entitlement dichotomy). Her Honour considered that, in the legislation before her, the fact that a decision could be made only after an audit report was obtained and only within 14 days of receipt of that report was important. However, her Honour also applied the reasoning of Davies J in Freeman in concluding that the decision was not part of an administrative continuum. Her Honour also observed at [30] [31]: [30] ... In my view, the Tribunal would be undertaking a quite different process from that which the Principles required the accreditation body to undertake were it to review a decision made under s 3.24 by reference to factual material remote in time from the review audit report. In particular, I consider that on review of a decision made under s 3.24 it is not open to the approved provider to seek to undermine the significance of the review audit report, and the recommendations included in it, by calling evidence of improvements in its practice and procedure implemented after the date of the decision and in response to the review audit report and recommendations. [31] I conclude that the Tribunal would not be addressing the same questions as the applicant was required to address if it were to determine whether, at the time of the Tribunal's decision, the decision of the applicant under s 3.24 of the Principles can be seen to be the correct or preferable decision. This is not to say that the Tribunal cannot receive evidence of facts that occurred after the date of the decision under review. However, to be relevant to the Tribunal's decision, that evidence must, in my view, bear on the merits of the decision as at the time that it was required to be made.' In summary, the Authority submitted, by way of reply, that: (1) Applying the principles stated in Freeman , the review of a decision to cancel a migration agent's registration on a particular date involves a determination of whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision at that date. (2) Where a decision is made to cancel, say because an agent does not have the necessary ambit of knowledge of migration procedures at the time of the decision (as shown by a track record of failings in this regard), a review applicant cannot show that that was not the correct or preferable decision by acquiring the relevant knowledge thereafter. If the person has become eligible, he or she may then be able to apply for registration afresh. (3) Similarly, where a decision is made to cancel because of massive and serious violations of the Code of Conduct, it would be absurd if a review applicant could seek to rely upon compliance with the Code after the date of the decision. Compliance achieved by enforcement proceedings is not what the legislation is designed to achieve. Agents are required to comply with the legislation when registered. (4) For these reasons and the reasons outlined above, this Court should follow Freeman and the cases that have applied it and conclude that the question before the Tribunal, in relation to the cancellation decision, was whether the decision to cancel on 14 July 2003 was the correct or preferable decision having regard to the circumstances pertaining up to that time. (5) The respondent argued that it would be against the policy of the Act if the Tribunal were not permitted to have regard to events following the cancellation decision. He suggests there is no reason why the Tribunal should not find that it has become satisfied of s 303(1)(e) if an agent becomes bankrupt during the review processes. The Authority says that this reasoning is flawed and not necessary. A later bankruptcy does not indicate that any earlier decision to cancel because of lack of integrity was the correct or preferable decision. It is irrelevant to that question (or without more would be). The Authority could, of course, cancel the registration afresh on the basis of the bankruptcy when it becomes aware that that has happened. A person whose registration was wrongfully cancelled should not have it affirmed simply because a reason to cancel it subsequently arises. There is also a fresh power to cancel when a proper reason arises. Likewise, a person whose cancellation was correct or preferable should not be able to avoid that proper consequence because of actions taken after the decision to rectify perceived deficiencies. (6) Contrary to the respondent's submission, no part of the Authority's argument requires the notion of fitness or character to be narrowly construed. However, success rates in late 2003 and 2004 simply have no bearing on the respondent's fitness before that time; nor does any absence of subsequent breaches of the Code. (7) It may be accepted that evidence of 'character' after the date of the decision could be relevant because 'character' has been held to involve the enduring moral qualities of a person. So, for example, evidence that a person has lied or not been frank in their evidence after the date of the decision would be relevant not directly as breaches of a rule requiring honesty but as an indicia of a person's enduring moral qualities. An inference would be available that an adult prepared to lie to or mislead the Tribunal (or just not be frank) at its hearing had the same moral qualities at the time of the decision. However, this reasoning does not mean that evidence relating to every criteria post the cancellation decision is relevant. For example, evidence that an agent has knowledge in 2004 simply does not show that he had that knowledge in 2003. (8) The respondent's reliance upon Peko-Wallsend is misconceived. The Authority does not say that the Tribunal may not have regard to the most up to date evidence at hand. However, it has to be evidence that is relevant to the question at hand; the position in July 2003. (9) Contrary to the respondent's submission, the absence of a time limit for the making of a decision to cancel does not have the result that the Tribunal is required to make its decision on the basis of all evidence up to the time of its decision: Freeman ; Nong . (10) The respondent seeks to get some assistance from extrinsic materials. It is said that his construction is consistent with the object stated in the passage quoted. However, without conceding that this is a proper use of extrinsic materials, it may be answered by noting that the Authority's construction is also consistent with that object. (11) Contrary to the respondent's submission, it would not be inimical to the achievement of the objects of the provisions if the Tribunal could not have regard to adverse developments that happened after the making of the decision under review. The Authority would be having regard to such conduct and is ideally placed to take appropriate action even if a review is pending in relation to an earlier decision (indeed this happened in this very case, when the respondent's registration was suspended while the cancellation review was pending). (12) It would, however, be inimical to the achievement of the objects if agents who have been cancelled for failing to comply with the Code of Conduct or failing to maintain necessary knowledge can avoid that legislated consequence by relying upon subsequent improved conduct and subsequent compliance. A system of this kind is less likely to be effective in ensuring that agents comply at all times if there is a perception that (the consequences of) breaches can be avoided. (13) The respondent's submissions at [34] supra misconceive Davies J's reasons in Freeman . They did not turn upon the fact that the Tribunal had affirmed the cancellation decision but upon the nature of the decision under review. The respondent's argument is some kind of bootstraps argument. The Tribunal's decision is being challenged because it failed to appreciate the nature of its task. That task does not have a different nature according to the conclusion it reaches at the end of the task. (14) The respondent submitted that all the evidence relied upon by the Tribunal in addressing the question it answered (as at September 2005) would have been available if it had asked itself the correct question (as at July 2003). This is said to support a futility argument. This Court should not accept the proposition that the Tribunal's error (it is implicitly admitted by the respondent that it did answer the question as at September 2005 and, on the Authority's submissions as to law this would be an error of law) could not have made a difference. (15) First, some of the evidence was not relevant to 14 July 2003: (a) 'Is this form of file note taking ... does this represent approximately what your current practice would be with taking files notes--- Yes ... .' (AB 550) (b) 'Is that representative of your current practice in relation to client agreements?' (AB 551) (c) 'Mr Shi, do you now keep copies or is it your practice to keep copies of letters on file to your clients? Yes, yes.' (AB 555.3) (d) The evidence of his success rate from the beginning of 2003 until August 2004 presented in a form that did not disclose that rate as at July 2003. (AB 566 567, 575 576, 803, 775 776) (16) In any event, even if the evidence were all relevant it may have been weighted differently if the correct question were asked. The Court should remit the matter to the Tribunal if it finds that the Tribunal misunderstood its task. (17) As the Tribunal dealt with all four review decisions together, the Court cannot be sure that the Tribunal did not have regard to the later evidence only in relation to the decisions of later dates. The point is, however, that the Tribunal dealt with them all together when it needed to separate the decision according to their nature and the evidence that was relevant to each. The fact that it did not do this proves the Authority's case rather than the reverse. After having considered the relevant provisions of the Act, the authorities to which I was referred and the respective submissions of the parties, I have concluded that the 'clear line of authority', beginning with the decision of Davies J in Freeman , upon which the Authority relies, does govern the position in relation to the cancellation decision and that the question which the Tribunal had to ask itself was whether, on 14 July 2003, the correct or preferable decision was to cancel the respondent's registration; in other words, the question which the Tribunal had to ask itself was whether, as at that date, the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance. I am of the view that the Tribunal did not ask itself this question. Rather, it asked itself whether, at the time of its decision, the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance. I am impelled to the view that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question by reference to the Tribunal's 2 September 2005 reasons, in particular at [14], [15] [17] and [24]: See the particular passages at [21] supra."
discussed,G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631,"There must be some doubt as to whether a case described in these terms falls within a fourth class, additional to those described in Masters v Cameron . Assuming the existence of a binding agreement, it is always open to the parties to that agreement to vary it by adding additional terms. Viewed in that light, the so-called fourth class appears not to differ from the first or second classes referred to in Masters v Cameron . Although the New South Wales Court of Appeal upheld McLelland J's judgment, there is no reference in the judgment of McHugh JA, with whom Kirby P and Glass JA agreed, to Masters v Cameron , or to a ""fourth class"". In G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631 at 635-636, McHugh JA said: If the parties agreed on additional terms, they would be added to the formal contract. If they did not, the formal contract would give effect only to the agreed terms and conditions of the correspondence. The case, therefore, is one where the parties were bound by the informal agreement but expected to make a further contract which by consent might contain additional terms: Sinclair, Scott &amp; Co Ltd v Naughton."
followed,"Ryan v Hansen [2000] NSWSC 354 , 49 NSWLR 184","When making a determination, it is no part of the function of a costs assessor to entertain cross-claims which may be brought or to determine whether or when costs are payable: Muriniti v Lyons [2004] NSWSC 135. Albeit addressing the provisions in the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW), Dunford J there observed: [56] Having regard to the status and powers of Costs Assessors and the ordinary meaning of the word ""assessor"", I am satisfied that the powers of Costs Assessors are limited to determining the value of the work done or services rendered in circumstances where there is no dispute that costs are payable and the only issue is as to the amount. It is no part of their function to determine whether or when such costs are payable. The matters set out in s 208A which they must, and in s 208B which they may, take into account are all matters relevant to putting a value on the work done or services rendered and the fairness or justice of the amount claimed; but are not matters which relate to the terms of a costs agreement (particularly if oral) and whether any conditions precedent to payment have been fulfilled. The determination of such questions requires the reception of sworn evidence, which can be tested by cross-examination, and an assessment of such evidence. Costs Assessors do not have the power to deal with such matters. [57] For similar reasons it has been held that a Costs Assessor has no power to hear a cross-claim by a client against a solicitor based on negligence, nor to award damages: Ryan v Hansen, supra per Kirby J; or to make an assessment when no costs are presently due and payable: Lace v Younan [1999] NSWSC 1072 per Master Harrison (no bill of costs rendered); Baker v Kearney [2002] NSWSC 746 per Master Malpass (judgment in District Court that applicant for assessment not entitled to costs). I am therefore satisfied that on being notified of the dispute as to the plaintiff's liability to pay the costs, the Costs Assessor should have declined to make a determination or issued a certificate unless and until such issue was resolved. Nothing said by the Court of Appeal in Wentworth v Rogers [2006] NSWCA 145 , 66 NSWLR 474 detracts from this particular conclusion of Dunford J. See also: Ryan v Hansen [2000] NSWSC 354 , 49 NSWLR 184. The same observations may be made in respect to the 2004 legislation."

The Commissioner, it was said, contended for a narrow meaning of the words 'in relation to' limiting the expenses under s 24 to costs such as delivery, commissions and cargo insurance. Woodside Energy argued that the words 'in relation to' and 'in carrying on or providing the operation facilities and other things comprising the project' should be construed having regard to the policy and objects of the legislation. It submitted that the term 'in relation to' requires a consideration of economic and commercial factors as well as physical and temporal factors.

Substantial discovery and other work was done, including the issue of some 50 subpoenas at the request of Cadbury. Cadbury failed to comply with a number of orders for the filing of evidence. Darrell Lea sought an order for dismissal under O 35A r 3 of the Federal Court Rules . On 23 December 2004 Ryan J adjourned the application to enable Cadbury, if so advised, to seek leave to discontinue: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1718. Subsequently his Honour granted leave to discontinue on terms that allowed Cadbury to commence a fresh proceeding no later than 7 June 2005. There was also a term that in any such fresh proceeding the parties could have the benefit of discovery already completed and documents already obtained on subpoena: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 112. As to costs, his Honour decided at ([5]) ""(o)n a fairly fine balance"" not to order solicitor-client costs because in any fresh proceeding the parties would have the benefit of the substantial work already carried out. His Honour was not able to reach a conclusion about the propriety of Cadbury's institution and maintenance of the proceeding, except for the procedural or interlocutory derelictions. These, his Honour considered (at [6]), should not attract a punitive order for costs to be taxed on the higher scale. 11 The decision of Ryan J was not appealed. Obviously I cannot make any order with respect to the costs of the earlier proceeding. Senior counsel for Darrell Lea however argued that when the present proceeding was commenced Cadbury had all the material obtained in the course of the earlier proceeding and should therefore have been aware then that its claim was hopeless. 12 But if there had not been the earlier proceeding it can be assumed that, broadly speaking, the same interlocutory procedures would have been carried out in the present proceeding and the same material obtained. The only difference would be that Cadbury would have been appraised of that material at a later stage and, on Darrell Lea's argument, should have discontinued then. In the end, the question would be the same, namely whether on the material available the claim would show wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law. For the reasons already given, I am not persuaded that such is the case. 13 The bare fact that a plaintiff discontinues a proceeding and commences another one does not of itself say anything as to the merits of the subsequent proceeding, still less as to whether or not failure in the subsequent proceeding should attract indemnity costs."

followed,Warne v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 259,"Warne v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 259 , Young CJ was asked to wind up an unregistered managed investment scheme. Part of the relief sought was an injunction restraining the exercise of rights under a vendor mortgage until after inquiry by an Associate Justice. The vendor mortgage purportedly secured debts due by investors in the scheme in respect of their purchase of the subject property. Issues had arisen as to the parties to the vendor mortgage and as to the amount due to the mortgagee under it. Young J decided to grant an injunction to preserve the status quo and to prevent the mortgagee from enforcing any rights it might have under the vendor mortgage. He did so for two reasons. First, because of the desirability of preserving rights pending determination of the issues as to the amount due to the mortgagee under the mortgage. Secondly, because there was a serious question as to breaches by the management company of its obligations to the investors which justified an enquiry. Primelife sought to distinguish this case from the present circumstances under consideration on the basis that it involved an inter partes proceeding and a dispute about scheme property. Such a distinction is not warranted. The case involved issues as to the implementation of the winding up of the scheme and was not an inter partes proceeding in the sense that it involved a dispute outside the framework of the winding up of the scheme. Primelife contended that whereas Warne v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (supra) involved a dispute about scheme property, the issue here involved Primelife's right to rescind which could not be classified as scheme property. That distinction is not valid. Primelife's right to rescind is in respect of the sale contract, which is executory and is scheme property. Although the investors in the present case contended that they had a cause of action available to them for misleading and deceptive conduct which would give rise to an injunction restraining enforcement of the sale contract, relying on s 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), they were not seeking the injunction for the purposes of enabling them to proceed with such a cause of action. Nor were they seeking an injunction to enable them, or for that matter, the liquidator, to institute a proceeding against the Primelife interests for not carrying out their obligations in relation to the promotion, implementation and administration of the schemes. Rather they wished the liquidator to have time to consider whether he might consider such actions being brought by him on their behalf. However, I consider such a possibility as an insufficient basis for the grant of an injunction. Even if such causes of action might be available to the investors or to the liquidator of the schemes on their behalf, such causes of action do not depend for their existence or prosecution on the fact that the sale contract is still alive, executory and capable of being completed by transfer if there were funds or finance available to enable the sale contract to be completed. If the sale contract were to be rescinded such causes of action would still be available to the investors. Of course, whether such causes of action might be successful depends on how the investors put their case and the strength of the evidence that is available to them. Put another way, there is no practical reason for the injunction to be granted or for the status quo in respect of the sale contract to be preserved. The investors do not suggest that they wish to complete the sale contract and they cannot obtain the finance to do so. If the sale contract is rescinded by the vendor, such causes of action as they may have available to them will not, by virtue of that rescission alone, be lost to them. Turning to the order sought that the liquidator be entitled to bring proceedings in his name as liquidator of the schemes on behalf of the schemes and/or Kastabon and/or Novena, there are conceptual difficulties in making such an order. Novena has gone into liquidation and has been de-registered. As counsel for Primelife pointed out, the liquidator is not the liquidator of Kastabon or Novena; rather he is liquidator of the scheme. But what is the scheme? It is not a legal entity as such. Each scheme was defined in the orders of 26 September 2005 winding up the schemes as the partnership formed pursuant to the partnership agreement dated 30 June 1999 between Kastabon as manager for the investors in the Kastabon Syndicate and Novena as manager for the investors in the Novena Syndicate."
cited,Widgery v Tepper (1877) 6 Ch D 364,"Dr Wenkart placed reliance on the statement of James LJ, with whom Baggallay LJ agreed, in Widgery v Tepper (1877) 6 Ch D 364 at 369 that: ""The authorities are sufficient to shew that a charging order cannot be given except for an ascertained sum, and not for costs, charges, and expenses, until they have been taxed."" In Wilkie v Wilkie &amp; Anor [1905] VR 80 at 82 Hodges J accepted, on the authority of Widgery v Tepper , that an ex parte order made by him charging a sum of money paid into court as security for costs of an appeal could not stand because the costs had not yet been taxed. See also Fine Real Estate Network Pty Ltd v Howell (unreported, Young J, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 4 December 1997). 82 I do not consider that I am free to accept that the principle invoked by the Court of Appeal in Widgery v Tepper has application in the circumstances of this case to invalidate the charge purportedly granted by Dr Wenkart over the Paddington property. The orders of 11 March 2002 were made by consent (see [15] above). While the proper construction of order 2 of those orders may be open to argument, there is no doubt that Dr Wenkart agreed to charge the Paddington property in favour of Mr Pantzer to secure the amount of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer was or might become lawfully entitled. He did so to facilitate the consideration by his creditors of a proposal under s 73 of the Act. Having taken the benefit of the agreement reflected in the consent orders, Dr Wenkart is not free now (a) to disown order 2 because of the Full Court's determination of the true extent of Mr Pantzer's lawful entitlements or (b) to suggest that the order cannot be given any practical effect. Having regard to the reasons for judgment of the Full Court, I conclude that the charge effected by order 2 encompasses all amounts to which, during the life of the charge, Mr Pantzer is or becomes lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart."
cited,New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4 ; (2003) 212 CLR 511,"Each of the individual respondents was a full time official of either the CFMEU or CFMEU NSW. Each was engaged in what may broadly be called union business on the days in question. No one was on a frolic of his own. For relevant purposes, officers of each organisation were cooperating or acting in concert to achieve a result. The conduct of each was in the course of employment. Each organisation is liable on ordinary principles of vicarious liability in tort ( New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4 ; (2003) 212 CLR 511 per Gleeson CJ at [40] [41]). 86 I reject the submission that the interference with contract was limited to the couple of hours for which the car was parked across the vehicular access to the site on 21 October 2003. It follows from the findings previously made that the intention of the officials of the Union was to ensure that the contract was terminated and that Silvestri P/L did not return to the site. Whilst closure of the site on 21 October 2003 might be directly attributed to the Council, the closure of the site for that reason was not the effective cause of the termination of the contract with Silvestri P/L. That result was achieved by the concerted action of the Union officials. 87 Liability can be summarised as follows: (1) Lane, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 170NC. (2) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 45D. (3) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW induced a breach of the contract between LGB and Silvestri P/L."
referred to,Dudzinski v Centrelink [2003] FCA 308,"Assuming that there is power to set aside the judgment in the present case I would not exercise the broad discretion conferred in favour of the applicant on the motion. It is well settled that, although broad, the discretion conferred by O 35 r 7(2)(c) should be exercised in a judicial manner and only in exceptional circumstances: Dudzinski v Centrelink [2003] FCA 308 at [11] . This guideline is based on the principle of finality of litigation which counsels courts to exercise caution when considering whether orders previously made and final on their face and entered should be reopened for consideration and set aside. 18 One of factors to take into account is whether there has been any satisfactory explanation or realistic attempt to comply with the orders which were made more than 6 months ago. I am not satisfied in the circumstances of this case that any satisfactory attempt was made to comply with the orders and file a new application or to have the orders vacated with the consequence that the dismissal orders have come into effect. 19 It is imperative in this case that the overlap issue be resolved as soon as possible in order to enable resolution of not only these claims but also other claims in the area. At the Western Land Summit held on 26 March 2006 the applicant had executed agreements with the Budjiti, Boonthamurra and Wangkumarra applicant, with the consequence that, on their face, these agreements resolved the overlaps between the applications. These agreements had been filed in Court in support of the orders sought by the applicant in each matter and made on 26 April 2006. 20 Because the directions to the applicant to file a new application were part of a cluster-wide strategy that required the resolution of overlaps, it is important to ensure their efficacy. It was made perfectly clear on 26 April 2006 that the claims would be dismissed and that a new application had to be made. There was no application to prevent the dismissal made prior to 2 November 2006 despite an inconclusive meeting of the claim group on 5 August 2006. That meeting could not proceed as an authorisation meeting because of the inability of those present to agree who were the relevant Kullilli People. 21 If the present applications were to be reinstated it would create an overlap with a new application filed by the Boonthamurra People in response to orders made in their application and it would slow the progress of the application and result in overlapping applications being programmed for hearing, which is a consequence to be avoided. 22 On the other hand, if the application for reinstatement is dismissed the Kullilli People can bring fresh proceedings, which are properly authorised under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), for the recognition of native title which reflect the agreements identified above and which will remove the doubts inherent in the present circumstances. 23 There is real doubt surrounding the question whether there has been proper authorisation in relation to a number of matters, including the appointment Messrs Drakopoulos Black and the revocation of the instructions to QSNTS. It is therefore desirable in the interests of certainty and resolution of the claims in the cluster that there be a new and clear authorisation to the future progress of these matters. 24 Accordingly, in these circumstances and for the above reasons, I dismiss the application for reinstatement and refuse the application to set aside the order which came into effect on 1 November 2006. I make no order as to costs. I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.

cited,Yates v Boland [2000] FCA 1895,"cannot be correct that the circumstances described in Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 constitute necessary pre-conditions to the exercise of the Court's discretion to award non-party costs pursuant to s 43 as submitted by the applicants. While obviously the comments of Mason CJ and Deane J would be an appropriate guide to the exercise of discretion in an appropriate case, they were clearly obiter (see observations of the Full Court in Yates v Boland [2000] FCA 1895). As the exercise of the discretion in s 43 is unfettered, other than the requirement that it be exercised judicially ( Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 at [192] ; Gore (2002) 119 FCR 429 at 447-448), it follows that the comments in Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 could not prescribe prerequisites to the exercise of discretion to award costs against a non-party. Inevitably, as the Full Court pointed out in Gore (2002) 119 FCR 429 at 437: ...there is no reason to suppose that the remarks of the members of the High Court in Knight have closed the door to the categories of third parties who may be made liable for the costs of litigation nor that the circumstances that were identified by their Honours were exhaustive. ... and later ...the learned trial judge erred when he regarded the passage in Knight as laying down three principles, each of which must be present before a stranger to the litigation could be made liable for costs.

The applicant argued that the determination of the justiciable controversy required the determination of both the applicant's claim and its defence, namely, that the impugned conduct was 'protected action' under the Act and afforded the respondent immunity from the suit brought by the applicant under the TP Act in respect of an alleged breach of s 45D of that Act . The respondent argued that this was a sufficient basis upon which the Court could conclude that the respondent was a party to a proceeding in a matter arising under the Act for the purposes of s 347 of the Act . In support of this submission, the respondent relied upon the following observations of the High Court in the case of L.N.C. Industries Limited v B.M.W. (Australia) Limited [1983] HCA 31 ; (1983) 151 CLR 575 at 581 ('L.N.C.') : 'It is true to say that a matter does not arise under a law made by the Parliament merely because the interpretation of the law is involved: Felton v Mulligan ((1971) 124 CLR 376, at pp. 374, 382, 396, 408, 416).

Equally, there is a matter arising under a federal law if the source of a defence which asserts that the defendant is immune from the liability or obligation alleged against him is a law of the Commonwealth: Felton v Mulligan ((1971) [1971] HCA 39 ; 124 CLR [367] , at p. 408).'"

referred to,Robmatjus Pty Ltd v Violet Home Loans Australia Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 165,"The respondents' submission that Mr Donovan, as a member of a class of possible objects of appointment, has no proprietary interest in the trust assets is correct: In re Coleman; Henry v Strong (1888) 39 Ch D 443 ; In re Weir's Settlement Trusts; Macpherson v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] Ch 145. However, I do not think that is fatal to the applicants' application. I say that for the following reason. I think the test formulated by the High Court in Cardile ((ii) in the passage quoted above at [15]) and reflected in O 25A r 5(5) is wide enough to cover the present circumstances. Both refer to a process which ""is or may ultimately be available"" and the fact that the third party "" may be obliged to disgorge assets"" or contribute towards satisfying the judgment or prospective judgment. It is possible that Mr Donovan will receive an interest under the Stephen Donovan Family Trust which is recoverable by a trustee in bankruptcy in the event that the applicants obtain a judgment against Mr Donovan and he is placed into bankruptcy upon being unable to satisfy that judgment. I am mindful of the fact that considerable caution must be exercised in making freezing orders against third parties, but at the same time there needs to be some flexibility in the test, as the circumstances of this case plainly show. Other courts have considered that the use of the word ""may"" is significant: Westpac Banking Corporation v Hilliard [2001] VSC 187 ; Audio Products Group Pty Ltd v Mamone [2005] NSWSC 982 ; Robmatjus Pty Ltd v Violet Home Loans Australia Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 165."
applied,Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511,"reject this argument. It appears that a part of the defence likely to be raised by Mr and Mrs Georgiou will be to allege that they acted on Mr Beames' advice. Also the case that the Commissioner seeks to bring in PAAN's name against Mr Beames alleges that he did advise the company to act in the way it did. Thus, Mr Beames will be a proper and necessary party to the proceedings. The controversy between the other parties will involve an examination of Mr Beames' role in the events leading to the payments of the various sums complained of to Mr and Mrs Georgiou and of the company's failure to pay or provide for the payment of payroll tax at various times. The other claims which the Commissioner seeks to bring in his own right appear also to be part of the one matter or controversy: see Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511 at 585-586 [140] - [142] , 587-588 [145]-[147] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, with whom Gleeson CJ and Gaudron J agreed at 546 [25]-[26]. Mr Beames argued that there was not enough evidence that there was a real dispute to which he was a party and that the affidavit of Mr Bayliss went no further than a series of unsubstantiated assertions which did not identify the facts upon which they were made with any precision. During the course of argument, I was taken to passages in the transcript of the examinations which indicated, as I have set out above, a sufficiently arguable basis on which the claims could be made. In the examinations, Mr Georgiou swore that he acted in reliance upon Mr Beames advice. That raises a sufficiently arguable case to justify Mr Beames' joinder in the proposed proceedings."

While offer and acceptance may be the primary mode of ascertaining the existence of an agreement, in an appropriate case, including where there is no readily identifiable offer and acceptance, a court may look at the matter more broadly by asking whether, objectively and having regard to the totality of the dealings between the parties, they should be considered to have entered into a contractual relationship without inquiring too closely into the formalities of offer and acceptance: see Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract (9th ed, LexisNexis, 2008) at 97 and Vroon BV v Foster's Brewing Group Ltd [1994] 2 VR 32 at 79-83.

As this formulation of the test makes clear, the onus is on the party seeking to prevent disclosure of a document. 26 This onus has been described by Lindgren J as a ""heavy burden"" requiring the proponent of immunity to ""establish a 'real' rather than merely 'some' or 'any' detriment to the public interest from disclosure"" of the documents: Somerville v ASC (1995) 60 FCR 319 at 354. If the proponent cannot establish any such interest as a threshold matter, then the balancing test never arises, and the immunity claim will fail at the outset: As the High Court said in Alister v The Queen [1983] HCA 45 ; (1983) 154 CLR 404 at 412, "" the balancing exercise ... can only be taken when it appears that both aspects of the public interest do require consideration "" (Emphasis added)."
followed,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Wiggins (1998) 90 FCR 314,"a reading of s 1323 demonstrates, it does not provide for a general freezing order of the kind sought by ASIC as its primary relief. Even the interim orders for which s 1323(3) provides are limited to orders of the kind applied for under subs (1). The absence of power under s 1323 to make mareva type orders against ""the relevant person"" in respect of property held by that person was noted by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Wiggins (1998) 90 FCR 314 at 319. That is not to say that a more general mareva type order may not be made on an interlocutory basis pending the determination of a substantive application under s 1323. Such an order, as an interlocutory order, would be authorised by s 23. Finkelstein J was not in doubt that he had the power to make an order of the kind sought by ASIC ""but it would not be an order in pursuance of the powers conferred by s 1323"" (at 320). Counsel for ASIC acknowledged the absence of power, under s 1323, to grant a mareva type order in relation to the assets of a company or individual. He relied upon s 23 of the Federal Court Act as the primary source of power for the orders which ASIC seeks. In my opinion, however, this is not an appropriate application of s 23. It is not open to ASIC to file an application for freezing orders in proceedings under s 1323 then effectively ignore s 1323 and say it is relying upon s 23 of the Federal Court Act. The question about the way in which s 23 could be invoked in an application under s 1323 was raised by the Court in argument. Subsequently, both parties were given time to file written submissions on the point which they have done and which have been considered."

What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement. The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction.' (citations omitted) And in CEPU 162 FCR at 510 [164]-[165] Weinberg, Bennett and I said: ' In the construction of a contract, the court places itself in the commercial matrix in which the parties were at the time that the contract was made.

discussed,Re A Debtor [1943] 1 Ch 210,"Re A Debtor [1943] 1 Ch 210 at 219 Lord Greene MR, with whom MacKinnon and Goddard LJJ agreed, said that it was true that in a case of inadvertence or of some reasonable excuse, the Court had jurisdiction to allow an amendment to enable compliance with the provisions of the English bankruptcy legislation, requiring a petitioning creditor to set out the fact and value of its security in the petition. His Lordship said at 219, in refusing to allow an amendment: was no inadvertence here, and no mistake of fact. On the other hand, there has been a deliberate attempt by the petitioning creditor throughout to maintain the position that he holds no security and is entitled to disregard the shares [which were the security] . I do not suggest that there has been any bad faith about that. He held, no doubt, a genuine belief that that was the legal position, but, in view of what I consider to be a very unfair attitude, I do not think we ought to allow an amendment.' The position of Wright Designed in the present circumstances is not as clear in relation to its good faith. The verification of the grounds supporting the caveat are in flat contradiction to the verification of the petition. The arguments put forward by Wright Designed in support of its position that it is an unsecured creditor are, in my view, untenable. However, I am mindful of the fact that there is an unsecured creditor, Mr Wright, and of the fact that the McClymonts have not paid that judgment debt. Moreover, there is a public interest in the Court protecting the public generally against insolvents continuing to incur liabilities. But the purpose of ss 44(3) , (4) and (5) is that a secured creditor must make available for the purposes of the bankruptcy which it is seeking to procure in the presentation of the petition, the security which advantages that creditor over all unsecured creditors if the trustee so requires. Obviously, if the secured creditor values the security at nil, the trustee may decide not to require it to be made over, but the secured creditor must also make clear that it has a debt of at least the minimum statutory amount ($2,000) which may be proved for in the bankruptcy the petition seeks to bring about. That is, that sum is unsecured because the security is inadequate."
applied,Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589,"The legal principle sought to be invoked by Kooee is usually described as Anshum estoppel having its roots in Australia in the judgment of the High Court in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589: see especially at 598 and 602-603, per Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aichin JJ. The question for determination in the current proceeding is whether the Anshun principle applies to require Primus' proceeding in this Court to be dismissed without adjudication of its merits. 4 Before embarking on an examination of the relevant facts which are said to give rise to the operation of the Anshun principle, it is important to bear in mind the parameters of the principle guided by Anshun itself and subsequent judgments of the Full Court of this Court and various State Courts of Appeal. I now turn to those matters. I do so mindful of the fact that whether the principle applies depends on the particular circumstances involved: see Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (2007) 164 CLR 224 and Gibbs v Kinna (1999) 2 VR 19 at [23] per Kenny JA (with whom Phillips JA agreed). 5 The invocation of the Anshun principle is a serious step and a power which should not be exercised without a scrupulous examination of all the circumstances. It is to be applied only in the clearest of cases as it ends a litigant's right to have the merits of a claim adjudicated and may result in a serious injustice if applied too readily. To do otherwise would be to hamper free access to the courts without careful consideration of the consequences: see Ling v Commonwealth [1996] FCA 1646 ; (1996) 68 FCR 180 at 182 per Wilcox J and Gibbs v Kinna at [33]. 6 No estoppel arises unless the new claim relied on was so relevant to the subject matter of the first proceeding that it would have been unreasonable not to rely on it in that proceeding: Anshun at 602-603. However, the concept of relevance is more helpful when considering the failure to raise a defence than a failure to advance a claim: see Gibbs v Kinna at [24] and Egglishaw at [28]. Further, the mere fact that each proceeding is closely related is an insufficient basis to invoke the principle, given that it is concerned with substance and not form and technicalities: Bazos v Doman [2001] NSWCA 347 at [44] per Stein JA (with whom Priestly JA and Beazley JA agreed). 7 Other than in special circumstances, the principle applies if it was unreasonable for a claimant to have refrained from raising the new claim in the earlier proceeding: Anshun at 602; Egglishaw at [21]. The issue is not whether it would have been reasonable to advance the claim beforehand because it was possible to do so but whether it was unreasonable to defer reliance: Egglishaw at [24] and [34] and Gibbs v Kinna (per Ormiston JA) at [2]. 8 In considering the issue of unreasonableness, it is first necessary to determine whether the subject matter of the subsequent claim could have been raised in the earlier proceeding: Anshun at 598; Gibbs v Kinna at [23] and Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCA 422 ; (2004) 146 FCR 1 at [37] , per Lindgren J. Next, to invoke the principle, it must be shown that the same or substantially the same facts will arise for consideration in the new proceeding as arose in the earlier proceeding: Gibbs v Kinna at [23]. These two factors were described by Kenny JA in Gibbs v Kinna at [23] as ""...necessary but not sufficient considerations for the application of the principle..."". 9 Another factor indicative of unreasonableness is whether any judgment or order made in the later proceeding would conflict with any judgment or order made in the earlier proceeding: Anshun at 604; Gibbs v Kinna at [25] and Egglishaw at [32]. Putting to one side this factor and the two factors examined in the preceding paragraphs, there still remains a question whether the failure to raise the claim in the earlier proceeding was unreasonable: Egglishaw at [37]. 25 The claims raised in the current proceeding were relevant to the subject of the earlier proceeding given that the same parties were agitating issues concerning the breakdown of their commercial relationship. However, the fact that the New South Wales litigation and this proceeding are closely related is insufficient to invoke the Anshun principle. The question remains whether it was unreasonable for Primus to defer reliance on its current claims. 26 Based in large part on the inadequacy of the response of Primus' solicitor when asked why he did not raise the current issues earlier, the subject matter of the current claims could have been raised in the New South Wales Supreme Court at first instance. This may have been done by way of an amendment to that proceeding; with the original New South Wales claims raised in addition or in the alternative. 30 The alleged unreasonableness is not manifest. No doubt it would have been more convenient for the issues raised in the current proceeding to have been advanced in New South Wales, but that is not the question. It is not appropriate when considering the Anshun principle to say what a party could reasonably have done. The proper question is, was it unreasonable to do as that party did? In any event there is much force in the view expressed by Wheeler JA in Custombuilt Homes that one should exercise considerable caution in summarily dismissing an application before the issues are crystalised after the filing of a defence. To this one might add ""and/or contentions of fact and law"". A judgment dismissing the matter before the Court is interlocutory in nature. It would still be open to Kooee to advance its submissions based on the Anshun principle at the trial of the proceeding when the issues will be more clearly defined. 31 This is not a clear case for the invocation of the Anshun principle. The critical facts will differ substantially from the essential facts which were relevant in New South Wales, where the Separation Deed was the main focus of the Court's analysis as distinct from the conduct of Kooee over a confined period. There is no risk of inconsistent judgments or orders. It was not unreasonable for Primus to refrain from advancing its current claims before the Supreme Court of New South Wales."

applied,Comcare v Eames (2008) 101 ALD 90,"morning the parties were in agreement that the conclusion by the Tribunal that the disciplinary process commenced on 30 May 2002 was in error because of this Court's decision in Comcare v Eames (2008) 101 ALD 90. In Eames, Madgwick J concluded that the Tribunal had erred in law by considering that the disciplinary process did not include the investigation process giving rise to it. The application of Eames to the present case leads to the conclusion that the Tribunal erred in concluding that the disciplinary process did not begin until Mr Caldwell received the formal letter on 30 May 2002. Eames was decided on 1 April 2002. The last day of the hearing of this matter in the Tribunal took place on 4 April 2002. The evidence as to what was actually submitted to the Tribunal on that day is not entirely clear. What is clear, though, is that the Tribunal was aware of Eames . So much appears from paragraph 67 of its reasons for judgment which makes explicit reference to it. It is then necessary to deal with the application for leave to amend. The grant of leave was formally opposed. Ordinarily, on such an application, there would be two relevant matters. First, it would be necessary to ask whether the proposed amendment is one which has reasonable prospects of success. Secondly, it is to be asked whether the granting of the amendment would, or might, cause irremediable prejudice to the other party. Here, in light of Eames , there can be no question that the proposed amendment is arguable. That, of course, is reinforced by the fact that the proposed amendment has already appeared in the proceeding in the notice of contention filed by the respondent. Returning to the question of prejudice, the parties are in agreement that if the amendment is allowed then, in one shape or another, the proceeding will have to be remitted to the Tribunal. They are in disagreement as to what the nature of any re-hearing before the Tribunal should be. The appellant argues that the matter should be remitted to the Tribunal differently constituted. During argument, it became apparent that the basis for that argument was a suggestion that there would otherwise arise a reasonable apprehension of bias by way of prejudgment. On the other hand, the respondent submitted that all that needed to be done was for the Tribunal now to tailor its reasons for judgment with more care. It is difficult to be precisely sure how the hearing before the Tribunal will proceed. It may be that there is force in the submission that what has already taken place before the Tribunal, and what appears in its reasons for judgment, may bespeak a reasonable apprehension of bias by way of prejudgment. However, I explicitly make no finding about that matter. A proper consideration of that submission would, of course, require not only an analysis of the reasons of the Tribunal, but also of the transcript and of the various submissions which were made to it. One further matter which is relevant to the exercise of the discretion to grant leave to amend, and which was particularly pressed by Mr Caldwell, is the position of the appellant in these proceedings. The appellant was the successful party in Eames . The point was made by Mr Whybrow, who appeared for Mr Caldwell, that at the very time that Comcare was in this proceeding seeking to argue that the disciplinary action commenced with the formal letter of 30 May 2002, it had already argued before this Court in Eames that disciplinary action could include the investigation leading to that disciplinary action. Mr Caldwell had, therefore, been caused prejudice by Comcare's inconsistent positions, a matter said to justify a refusal to grant leave. If there were no identity of the parties at all this would obviously be irrelevant. There may be some force in the proposition that, generally speaking, it is undesirable for emanations of the executive to adopt inconsistent positions in civil litigation. However, not enough is known of the facts surrounding how the various positions in the two cases came to be adopted. I do not think, in those circumstances, it can be said that the unreasonableness of that is such that leave should not be granted. In those circumstances, I am prepared to grant Comcare's application to amend its notice of appeal to raise the proposed ground 2.3. One then needs to turn to the disposition of this morning's proceedings. It is convenient, first, to deal with ground 2.3 of the amended notice of appeal. Ground 2.3 is as follows: Whether the Tribunal erred in law by finding that the disciplinary action taken against Mr Caldwell did not commence until 30 May 2002. Setting aside a determination of the Tribunal by consent and remitting it to be determined according to law can be unhelpful if this Court does not provide reasons itself. In such cases the Tribunal is left with no guidance as to what it is that ""according to law"" means. For that reason I propose to say a few words in relation to the Eames ground. The Tribunal said at [55]-[57]: 55. During the period Mr Caldwell was on sick leave recovering from the effects of the flash-over he was advised by Mr Maher that he had arranged a number of meetings for Mr Caldwell to attend. Mr Caldwell was informed that one of these meetings was with the Switching Review Committee. By reason of his ill-health Mr Caldwell was unable to attend this meeting. 56. Mr Caldwell did attend a meeting with Mr Maher and Mr Winchester on 18 April 2002 when they interviewed him as to the circumstances in which he was injured. Also at this meeting Mr Maher requested Mr Caldwell to provide a written statement for consideration by the Switching Review Committee the following day. 57. On or shortly after 20 April 2002 Mr Caldwell received a copy of a report by the Committee. This report erroneously stated that Mr Caldwell was not wearing the correct gloves at the time of the incident. At [59] the Tribunal said: 59. On 2 May 2002 Mr Caldwell provided Mr Maher with a handwritten statement and a response to the report. On 13 May 2002 the Switching Review Committee issued an amended report in which it deleted the reference to Mr Caldwell not wearing protective gloves at the time of the incident. There was also a change as to the circumstances of Mr Caldwell's not having attended a meeting of the committee. Otherwise the report was the same as had been previously issued. On 30 May 2002 Mr Caldwell received the letter from his employer advising him of the action to be taken against him. In light of Eames these steps were aspects of the disciplinary action which occurred prior to 30 May 2002. It follows from that that the Tribunal's determination that the disciplinary process commenced on the 30 May 2002 is incorrect, and on that ground at least, the appeal must be allowed. As Madgwick J held in Eames , this is a question of law. In Comcare's appeal, there were two other sets of grounds. One related to the adequacy of the Tribunal's reasons insofar as it dealt with the interrelation between the medical evidence and the question of disciplinary action. The other was a question of unreasonableness in fact finding. Both of those debates are moot in light of a conclusion that the decision needs to be set aside because of the disciplinary action determination. In those circumstances, the appropriate orders are that the appeal be allowed, that the orders of the Tribunal formally entered on 30 May 2008 be set aside, that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal as originally constituted, and that the procedure to be adopted by the Tribunal is for it to determine. I should say in relation to that that there are procedural questions as to how the issue of the disciplinary action in the matter is now to be determined. This may require close consideration of the evidence which has already been led. These are matters for the Tribunal to determine. It is also for the Tribunal to determine any application made by Comcare for disqualification on the basis of prejudgment. I now turn to the question of costs. The Eames point was raised in the respondent's notice of contention on 17 July 2008. In my opinion, the appellant should have detected the Eames problem at that time, or shortly thereafter that time, but certainly before last Friday. It follows from that that between 17 July 2008 and very recently the parties have been engaged in litigation which would not have occurred if Comcare had fully appreciated the significance of the notice of contention. On the other hand, today's hearing would have undoubtedly taken place once the Eames point was discerned. In those circumstances, it is appropriate to order that each party pay their own costs prior to 17 July 2008. From 17 July 2008 to 14 December 2008 the appellant is to pay the respondent's costs. In relation to the costs of today, each party is to pay their own. I have considered whether to impose a costs condition on the grant of leave to appeal of the kind explored during argument but I have concluded that that is inappropriate. The reasons for that are, first, what exactly is going to happen in the Tribunal is presently unclear. It may disqualify itself; it may conduct a hearing at which only submissions are made; it may conduct a hearing at which further evidence is taken. It is not possible in that circumstance to fashion an appropriate costs order which would be fair. Secondly, the orders of the Tribunal of 24 April 2008 (entered 30 May 2008) having been set aside, the costs of those first proceedings are now undetermined. One of the issues which the Tribunal will have before it on the second hearing is the question of the costs of its first proceedings. The Tribunal will be better placed than I am to deal with that issue. It is for those reasons I do not impose a costs requirement as a condition of the grant of leave. I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Perram.

cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 230 ALR 370,"Next, in relation to this ground, the applicant appears to advance a contention that having regard to the provisions of s 201 , the use of s 501 is for an improper use or an act of bad faith. The applicant says that, by slavishly following policy, and applying s 501 in matters where s 201 could apply, there has been an error in so far as discretionary power has been exercised in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the applicant's case, and without availing the applicant of a process by which he could convince the decision-maker to consider his matter under s 201. I consider that this argument is precluded by the decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 230 ALR 370: see also Evans v Minister [2006] FCAFC 180."
discussed,Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622,"A court should not engage upon a determination of the merits of the case where the only outstanding claim is as to costs. See Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 and One.Tel Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 at 552-553. Those cases also demonstrate that a court may inquire as to the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties to ascertain whether or not orders for costs should be made. Those cases would have no point if it were open to a party to ask the court to make a judgment in the very general form suggested by counsel. That in the present actions against Giant Marine, the Adsteam payments have disposed of all issues other than costs appears from the decision of the High Court in Baxter v Obacelo Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 66 ; (2001) 205 CLR 635 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at [38], [39], [40], [43], [46] and [47] and per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [55] and [56]. In particular it should be noted that Gummow and Hayne JJ approved the statement of ""general principle"" contained in the passage cited at [56] from the judgment of Auld LJ in Jameson v Central Electricity Generating Board [1998] QB 323. That general principle is: Where accord and satisfaction cannot be relied upon, as where a claimant settles with only one of two concurrent tortfeasors, the tortfeasor facing a claim will nevertheless have a defence if the plaintiff's settlement with the other has fully compensated him for the separate wrongs done to him. 18 Finally, the plaintiffs seek to distinguish Lai Qin and One.Tel upon the basis that they presently ask for summary judgment or judgment on admissions and not a trial. I see no merit in that argument. In preparing for such an application costs will be incurred by both sides. In some cases those costs may be relatively insignificant. In others they may be substantial. The policy considerations supporting the decisions to which I have referred are as relevant to these applications as they are to trials. 20 The plaintiffs submit that if they are not entitled to summary judgment they are nonetheless entitled, in claiming costs, to seek to demonstrate that they would probably have won had the actions gone to judgment. They rely on the same matters as they rely upon in connection with the summary judgment application plus some aspects of the evidence filed in anticipation of a trial. Their position seems to be that Giant Marine ought to have responded to that evidence, and that its failure to do so demonstrates that their evidence ought to be accepted. There is an incongruity between such an approach and the decisions in Lai Qin and One.Tel to which I have previously referred. If the parties are to call and cross-examine witnesses, then the process starts to look very much like a trial on the merits for the sole purpose of deciding questions of costs. The plaintiffs' approach also ignores the possibility that even in the absence of contrary evidence, their evidence may have been discredited in cross-examination. 21 In Lai Qin (supra), McHugh J said: In an appropriate case, a court will make an order for costs even when there has been no hearing on the merits and the moving party no longer wishes to proceed with the action. The court cannot try a hypothetical action between the parties. To do so would burden the parties with the costs of a litigated action which by settlement or extra-curial action they had avoided. In some cases, however, the court may be able to conclude that one of the parties has acted so unreasonably that the other party should obtain the cost of the action. In administrative law matters, for example, it may appear that the defendant has acted unreasonably in exercising or refusing to exercise a power and that the plaintiff had no reasonable alternative but to commence the litigation. ... Moreover, in some cases a judge may feel confident that, although both parties have acted reasonably, one party was almost certain to have succeeded if the matter had been fully tried. This is perhaps the best explanation of the unreported decision of Pincus J in South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission ... where his Honour ordered the respondent to pay 80 per cent of the applicant's fixed costs even though his Honour found that both parties had acted reasonably in respect of the litigation. But such cases are likely to be rare. If it appears that both parties have acted reasonably in commencing and defending the proceedings and the conduct of the parties continued to be reasonable until the litigation was settled or its further prosecution became futile, the proper exercise of the costs discretion will usually mean that the Court will make no order as to the cost of the proceeding. This approach has been adopted in a large number of cases. 22 McHugh J was speaking in the context of a case in which the ultimate relief sought by the applicant had been obtained without the need for continued litigation. The court was fully aware of the basis upon which the matter was to be discontinued. In many cases the court will be told simply that the matter has been settled without any reference to the terms of settlement. In other cases the terms of settlement may say little or nothing about the relative merits of the case had it gone to trial. It seems unlikely that McHugh J, in referring to the likelihood of success, meant to suggest that such likelihood should be assessed by detailed reference to the evidence which would have been called had the matter gone to trial. Such an approach would be inconsistent with the second and third sentences in the above extract. McHugh J probably had in mind a settlement which occurred after a substantial part of the evidence had been heard. 23 In any event, even on the plaintiffs' approach, I am far from satisfied that they would probably have succeeded. Such anticipated success is said to be based upon the fact that Giant Marine admitted that the damage to the two vessels was ultimately caused by the failure of the discharge pipe and/or the defective fender and that Adsteam had failed to take reasonable care in the management of the tug by failing to detect such defects. The plaintiffs assert that Giant Marine is liable for Adsteam's negligence by virtue of the Standard Conditions. It is common ground that such conditions were part of the contract between Giant Marine and Adsteam. Clauses 3 and 4 are as follows: 3. Whilst towing or whilst at the request, express or implied, of the Hirer, rendering any service other than towing, the mater and crew of the tug or tender shall be deemed to be the servants of the Hirer and under the control of the Hirer and/or his servants and/or his agents and anyone on board the Hirer's vessel who may be employed and/or paid by the Tugowner shall likewise be deemed to be the servant of the Hirer and the Hirer shall accordingly be vicariously liable for any act or omission by any such person so deemed to be the servant of the Hirer. 4. Whilst towing, or whist at the request, either express or implied of the Hirer, rendering any service of whatsoever nature other than towing:- (a) The Tugowner shall not be responsible for or be liable (i.) for damage of any description done by or to the tug or tender, or done by or to the Hirer's vessel or done by or to any cargo or other thing on board or being loaded on board or intended to be loaded on board the Hirer's vessel or the tug or tender or by or to any other object or property; or (ii.) for loss of the tug or tender or the Hirer's vessel or of any cargo or other thing on board or being loaded on board or intended to be loaded on board the Hirer's vessel or the tug or tender or any other object or property; or (iii.) for any personal injury or loss of life howsoever and wheresoever caused including personal injury or loss of life of the master and/or crew of and/or any person on board the tug or tender; or (iv.) for any claim by a person not a party to that agreement for loss or damage of any description whatsoever. arising from any cause, including (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) negligence at any time of the Tugowner's servants or agents, unseaworthiness, unfitness or breakdown of the tug or tender, its machinery, boilers, towing gear, equipment, lines, ropes or hawsers, lack of fuel, stores, speed or otherwise, and (b) The Hirer shall be responsible for, pay for and indemnify the Tugowner against and in respect of any loss or damage and any claims of whatsoever nature or howsoever arising or caused whether covered by the provisions of clause 4(a) hereof or not (including any arising from or caused by the negligence of the Tugowner or his servants or agents) including the loss of or damage to the tug or tender, provided that the Hirer shall not be liable to the Tugowner for or in respect of loss, damage or claims which the Hirer proves (the burden of proof being on the Hirer) to have been solely caused by the failure of the Tugowner, and due to the actual fault or privity of the Tugowner, to make his tug or tender seaworthy for the towage or service other than towage. Provided however, notwithstanding anything, hereinbefore contained, the Tugowner shall under no circumstances be responsible for or be liable for any loss or damage caused or contributed to, by or arising out of any delay or detention of the Hirer's vessel or of the cargo on board or being loaded on board or intended to be loaded on board the Hirer's vessel or of any other object or property or of any person, or any consequences thereof, whether or not the same shall be caused or arise whilst towing or whilst at the request, either express or implied of the Hirer, rendering any service of whatsoever nature other than towing or at any other time whether before during or after the making of this agreement. 24 The following definitions contained in cl 1 are also relevant: ""towing"" is any operation in connection with the holding, pushing, pulling, moving, escorting or guiding of the Hirer's vessel and the expression ""to tow"", ""being towed"" and ""towage"" shall be defined likewise. The expression ""whilst towing"" shall cover the period commencing when the tug or tender is in a position to receive orders direct from the Hirer's vessel to commence pushing, holding, moving, escorting or guiding the vessel or to pick up ropes or lines or when the tow rope has been passed to or by the tug or tender whichever is the sooner and ending when the final orders from the Hirer's vessel to cease pushing, holding, moving, escorting or guiding the vessel or to cast off ropes or lines has been carried out or how the tow rope has been finally slipped, whichever is the later, and the tug or tender is safely clear of the vessel. 41 I deal firstly with costs incurred prior to Adsteam's payments. Clearly, the reasonableness of the parties' conduct is a relevant consideration in determining the question of costs. McHugh J said as much in Lai Qin (supra). The plaintiffs submit that Giant Marine was unreasonable in not admitting negligence, unseaworthiness of the tug and damages. Giant Marine submits that the plaintiffs were unreasonable in failing to join Adsteam at an earlier stage in the proceedings. These two matters are closely related. Giant Marine also seeks to rely upon certain offers to settle made in the correspondence between the solicitors. 42 At one stage I expressed surprise at Adsteam's absence from the proceedings. At some time thereafter Adsteam was joined. My concern arose largely out of the fact that it seemed clear that the collision had been, at least substantially, caused by mechanical failure on the tug. The plaintiffs assert that their failure to join Adsteam at an earlier stage was the product of reasonable caution, designed to avoid the incurrence of unnecessary costs, given that they considered their cases against Giant Marine to be strong. That view was based upon an unrealistic assessment of the likelihood of establishing vicarious liability in Giant Marine. Although I disagree with the view taken by the plaintiffs, it was a matter of judgment. In any event, even if Adsteam had been joined earlier, it may not have paid earlier. Giant Marine's costs were incurred in defending proceedings brought against it. I am unable to conclude that such costs would not have been incurred had Adsteam been joined at an earlier stage. 43 Giant Marine's conduct in defending the actions must also be seen in light of the late joinder of Adsteam. From an early stage it was obvious that mechanical failure on the tug was the primary, if not the sole, cause of the plaintiffs' losses. It is reasonable to infer that Giant Marine would, if held liable, have looked to Adsteam for contribution or indemnity, subject to issues arising out of the Standard Conditions and any complications arising out of insurance arrangements. In those circumstances, Giant Marine could not safely make concessions as to liability or damages without reference to Adsteam. Adsteam's absence from the proceedings did not prevent Giant Marine from raising such matters with it, but Adsteam may have been reluctant to become involved. Further, despite the plaintiffs' views concerning the strengths of their respective cases, Giant Marine had reasonable prospects of success in resisting any finding of liability. In those circumstances I cannot see that it acted unreasonably in putting the plaintiffs to proof on all issues."

cited,Employment Advocate v Williamson [2001] FCA 836 ; (2001) 111 FCR 1,"His Honour concluded that the ""spill and fill"" proposal for the selection of certain employees within a group for involuntary redundancy was not ""sufficiently proximate"" to any of the forms of contravening conduct contained within s 298K. Dismissal of all employees for a prohibited reason is squarely within s 298K notwithstanding that they represent potentially a large group. Dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a non-prohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee. It would be an odd thing if the statutory quality of contravening conduct in respect of some employees could be dissolved amongst a group and remedial entitlements otherwise available to the affected individuals thereby lost. The question is whether the conduct, from the standpoint of the individual, notwithstanding others, represents conduct carried out for a prohibited purpose. It seems to me that the observations of Gray J in Employment Advocate v Williamson [2001] FCA 836 ; (2001) 111 FCR 1 at [23] : 'What is clear, however, is that for a contravention of s 298K to occur, there must be a person or persons who fall within the description in one or more of the prohibitive reasons.' and at [26]: 'It must be possible to identify some person or persons who answer the description in at least one of the prohibitive reasons in s 298L(1).' does not contradict the notion that an individual may fall within the description of the conduct even though such an individual forms part of a group such as that identified in the illustration by Weinberg J. 356 In this case, the employer entities dismissed a cohort of employees. Some of those employees, from their individual standpoint, contend the dismissal was for a prohibited reason. They say the circumstances that give rise to that apprehension can be seen in the attitude of Mr Ramsey to the AMIEU, his hostility to the participation of the Union in the workplace and the consequences of Union engagement in various processes before the AIRC and the dissatisfaction nine of the 12 individuals were articulating about conditions of employment against the background of the steps taken by the Union. As to three of the individuals, their concern lies in the chronology of events arising out of their constructive dismissal and the subsequent treatment of the individuals consequent upon obtaining orders from the AIRC and particularly orders for reinstatement. 357 The dismissal of the entire cohort of employees does not provide an answer to the essential character of the contravening conduct in respect of the particular individuals. The legislation provides a mechanism for an employer to demonstrate that the apprehended and thus alleged reasons for the dismissal are misplaced and incorrect by casting an onus upon the respondent to demonstrate otherwise. 358 The same position obtains in relation to the conduct of refusing to employ the relevant individuals. In essence, the respondents say that in the case of each individual, the particular person was not available for employment, did not seek employment and was not denied employment. Moreover, before a refusal to employ an individual for a prohibited reason can arise, the individual must demonstrate that a vacancy was available to be filled. 359 As to these matters, it is clear that the individuals did seek employment. Enquiries were made of management staff as to the availability of the work. Steps were taken to refuse immediate employment by some, but expressly for the purposes of trying to secure a return to work for all employees. Mr Delaforce and Mr Moss formulated a compromise proposal directed to securing the return to work for all employees. Some individuals were episodically offered employment on a day, sometimes after the event. Enquiries were made of management and in the immediacy of the dispute and enquiries were made at the gate as to those persons who were on the list for employment. The evidence demonstrates that jobs were available and vacancies were being filled. Subsequent offers, even though episodic, demonstrate that vacancies were there to be filled. Notwithstanding the lengthy period of employment on the part of the 12 individuals with the South Grafton Abattoir from the commencement of operations by Mr Ramsey and the pre-existing historical connection with the abattoir in the Gilbertson's days, none of these individuals (leaving aside Susan Young) were offered full time employment or any sustained period of casual employment."
applied,Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420,"In my view, counsel for the respondent's contention cannot be accepted. It is clear that the contractual intention was to provide the applicant with a termination payment of a minimum of six months, regardless of whether the relationship between the parties ended by the non renewal of the term of the consultancy agreement on the expiry of the existing term or by the termination of the agreement (other than for a reason set out in cl 8.1) during the currency of the term, of the consultancy agreement. This construction is consistent with the presence in the clause of the words 'or the Term (as extended or renewed) is not renewed '. The construction contended for by the respondent is inconsistent with the presence of those words in the clause and renders those words otiose. In my view, it is obvious that there was a mistake by the draftsman in using the word 'lesser' when the word 'greater' should have been used to give effect to the obvious intention of the parties. Where there is an obvious mistake the Court can give effect to the true contractual intention of the parties without there being any need for rectification. The principle was expressed thus by Santow J in the case of Spunwill Pty Ltd v BAB Pty Ltd (1994) 36 NSWLR 290 at 299: '...Where a court can discern the intent of the parties from an examination of the document as a whole, words may be supplied, omitted or corrected in the instrument, where it is clearly necessary in order to avoid absurdity or inconsistency: Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420 at 426-427. In such cases rectification of the document is not required: Re United Pacific Transport Pty Ltd [1968] Qd R 517; Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (at 346).' 126 In the case of Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420 the word 'inconsistent' was read to mean 'consistent'. 127 I have found below that, on the expiry of the term of the consultancy agreement on 30 June 2001, the term was not renewed. I am of the view that on the non-renewal of the consultancy agreement, the applicant became entitled to a termination payment under cl 8.6 of the consultancy agreement. It follows that, in my view, on the expiry of the term of the consultancy agreement on 30 June 2001, the applicant became entitled to a termination payment in a sum equal to six months' fee measured by reference to the annual consultancy fee of $190 000 (exclusive of GST). I will hear the parties on whether a GST component is to be included in that sum, as I apprehend the applicant to contend. 128 The evidence of Mr Hayes and Mr Brand established that there was an agreement by conduct that the consultancy fee of $190,000 per annum payable to the applicant under the consultancy agreement was from the date of the introduction of GST to be a fee that was to be free of GST. In other words, the applicant was entitled to earn that fee exclusive of GST and so it could add the amount of GST payable on the fee to the invoice furnished to the respondent. Such an agreement can also be inferred by the respondent's practice in paying the invoices rendered by the applicant and other consultants after 1 July 2001 which invariably included an additional amount in respect of GST."
cited,Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341,"essence, the submissions of the applicants are as follows: 1. Order 15 r 2(3) sets out the criteria by which the obligation to disclose might be tested. 2. Those criteria do not include documents leading to a train of inquiry. That was the test before the rules were amended in 1999. 3. Order 15 r 2 should be interpreted according to its terms; and the 'train of inquiry' test (as articulated in the leading case of The Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Company (1882) 11 QBD 55 per Brett LJ at 63, note also Menzies J in Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341 at 345) has no place in that context. 4. General discovery is that which occurs under O 15 r 2. 5. Order 15 r 8 entitles a court to make an order wider than that apprehended under O 15 r 2, however only where an application is made under O 15 r 8. 6. In terms of the Federal Court Rules and Practice Note 14, the order made by the Court on 15 February 2006 was an order apprehended under O 15 r 2(3). The submissions of the respondents may be summarised as: 1. The order of 15 February 2006 was 'The applicants and the respondents make discovery by verified List of Documents and file and serve such List of documents on or before 4.00 pm on 29 March 2006'. 2. The order did not limit discovery to the categories of documents in O 15 r 2, O 15 r 2(3) or otherwise. 3. Order 15 r 2 continues to authorise orders for general discovery, and although the court would not ordinarily make an order for general discovery it may consider it appropriate to do so, in which case the traditional obligations to discovery any document relating to a matter in question in the proceeding continues to apply. 4. Pursuant to O 15 r 8 the court may make orders requiring discovery of a document or class of documents 'relating to a matter in question in the proceeding' that may be or may have been in the possession, custody or power of a party. 5. An order of the court that the parties give discovery, without any further limitation , is a general order or direction for discovery. To limit the ambit of discovery the order, by its terms, should limit the extent of the discovery to be made by a party. 6. As there was no limitation appearing in the orders/directions the direction was for general discovery and the train of inquiry test applies. 7. Alternatively, the court may order a document or class of documents be discovered by affidavit in terms of O 15 r 8. The current version of O 15 r 2 was introduced into the Rules by SR 295 of 1999 Schedule 1, and became effective 3 December 1999. On the same day Practice Note 14 was issued by the Chief Justice. This Practice Note states, inter alia , that: &#8226; the general position is that the Court will not order general discovery as a matter of course &#8226; the Court will mould any order for discovery to suit the facts of a particular case &#8226; in determining whether to order discovery the Court will have regard to the issues in the case and the order in which they are likely to be resolved, the resources and circumstances of the parties, the likely cost of the discovery and its likely benefit &#8226; to prevent orders for discovery requiring production of more documents than are necessary for the fair conduct of the case, orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by O 15 r 2(3)."
cited,Lovett v Le Gall (1975) 10 SASR 479,"The issue of prejudice in the context of cases involving an application for extension of time was recently discussed by Cowdroy J in Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 624 at par 16. His Honour referred to comments of Bray CJ in Lovett v Le Gall (1975) 10 SASR 479: 'If the defendant has suffered no prejudice, as when he was well aware within the limitation period of the plaintiff's claim, or where the excess period of time is small, or where he cannot show that he has lost anything by reason of the delay, it may well be that the court will not find it difficult to come to the conclusion that it is fair and equitable in the circumstances to grant the extension.'

referred to,Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292,"A significant part of the case that Mr Boyes put to the Tribunal turned on his assertion that he wanted to re-establish his relationship with the mother of his son. It was in this context that the absence of evidence from the mother concerned the Tribunal and led it to adjourn the hearing in order that she might make a statement. When no statement from her was forthcoming, the Tribunal did not have an obligation to make further inquiries concerning the child. There was nothing to create such an obligation: compare Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 at 314 per Tamberlin, Sackville and Stone JJ; and Taylor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] per Marshall, Mansfield and Siopis JJ. Instead it was bound to decide the case on the evidence and other material before it. Upon this basis, it made the specific findings that the child's best interests would be achieved if he remained in Australia with his mother and that his interests would not necessarily be affected if Mr Boyes' visa were cancelled. The applicant has not made out jurisdictional error under ground (i)."
considered,Re Fernandes (1861) 6 H &amp; N 717; 158 ER 296 at 300-301,"Quite apart from its statutory origins, the Federal Magistrates Court has power to punish for contempt (see s 17 of the FMA). It was recognised in the United Kingdom that a court of assize or of nisi prius which had certain powers, including powers to punish for contempt, were regarded as superior courts although not principal superior courts: see Re Fernandes [1861] EngR 489 ; (1861) 6 H &amp; N 717; 158 ER 296 at 300-301. However, for the above reasons such historical indicia of a court have no application to the Federal Magistrates Court. 24 For the above reasons, the submissions of the applicant that the Registrars of the Federal Magistrates Court cannot exercise administrative functions are rejected. 25 The applicant submits that the text of the Oath of Office administered to a Registrar differs from that taken by a Federal Magistrate, and that such difference demonstrates a limitation on the Registrar's powers to issue orders in the name of the Federal Magistrates Court."
distinguished,Viskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc [2000] FCA 1695,"counsel for the Department placed considerable emphasis upon the decision of French J in Viskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc [2000] FCA 1695. There, his Honour was dealing with an application for information discovery under O 15A r 6. He said at [24] that the rule should not be permitted to authorise information discovery except for good cause shown in terms of the conditions. He continued:- In respect of patents for inventions, the exercise of the discretion must have regard both to the intrusive nature of the order and the need to encourage research and development unhampered by the prospect of speculative review of working papers by competitors. To allow the remedy in this case based upon formulaic recitations of wide application would set the threshold for pre-action discovery so low that there would be few cases in which a person wishing to challenge a patent could not obtain discovery of the kind which is sought here. However, these remarks are to be read in their context. His Honour expressed the view at [23] that the evidence which was required to satisfy the first element of O 15A r 6, namely reasonable cause to believe that an applicant has the right to obtain relief against the prospective respondent, was an opinion expressed as a conclusion stated in terms of the rule. His Honour considered that the conclusionary statement was insufficient to meet the requirements of O 15A r 6(a). I do not think it follows that his Honour's observations establish that a high threshold must be satisfied before an order will be made under O 15A r 3. It is true that French J said at [24] that if an order were made in that case it would establish a very low threshold for the application of the rule. But, in my opinion, that was because of the slender basis of the evidence in support of the ""reasonable cause to believe"". In my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper . Whilst good cause must be shown, each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice. Wyeth's evidence as to prospects of success"
referred to,NAIZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37,The appellant's third and final submission was that in considering relocation the Tribunal member failed to consider the appellant's symptoms of post-traumatic stress and the difficulties he would experience in terms of relocation in view of those symptoms. I was referred to NAIZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37 and SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Anor [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448.
referred to,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250,"turn now to consider whether settlement of the proceeding ought to be approved under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act .

The Court must assess whether the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement. In making this assessment, the Court may, and ordinarily will, take into account the amount offered to the group members, the prospects of success in the proceeding, the likelihood of the group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the amount nominated in the settlement offer, the terms of any advice from counsel and any independent expert, the likely duration and cost of the proceeding if continued to judgment, and the attitude of the group members to the settlement: see Williams v FAI Home Security [2000] FCA 1925 ; 180 ALR 459 at [19] . The Court must also be satisfied that the settlement has been made in the interests of the group members as a whole, and not merely the interests of the first and second applicants and the respondent: see ACCC v Chats House 71 FCR at 258."

cited,Chan v Zacharia [1984] HCA 36 ; (1984) 154 CLR 178,"It is sufficient to note for present purposes that (i) the distinguishing characteristic of a fiduciary relationship is that ""its essence, or purpose, is to serve exclusively the interests of a person or group of persons"" (which, as in the case of a partnership or fiduciary joint venture, can include the fiduciary): see generally Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane, at 5-005 ff; (ii) a relationship may be fiduciary in part and non-fiduciary in part: Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation , at 97-98 ff; (iii) insofar as the fiduciary relationship is claimed to be founded on mutual trust and confidence, the circumstances must nonetheless be such that the parties to the relationship can reasonably expect loyalty from the other, i.e. the subordination of self interest to joint interest: Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd at [11]-[13]; (iv) a person who provides information, suggestion or advice to another upon which that other may reasonably be expected to rely is not for that reason alone necessarily in a fiduciary relationship with that other, though that person will be a fiduciary if the factual matrix is such that that other is in the circumstances reasonably entitled to expect that the information provider, etc is acting in the matter in that other's interest: cf Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (in liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith (1991) 42 FCR 390; (v) the loyalty obligation imposed on a fiduciary is that he or she cannot (a) in any matter within the scope of the fiduciary relationship (see Bertchnell v Equity Trustees Executor &amp; Agency Co Ltd [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 408) have a personal interest or an inconsistent engagement with a third party; or (b) use his or her position to own, or to a third party, possible advantage, unless this is freely and informedly consented to by the person(s) to whom loyalty is owed, or is authorised by law: Chan v Zacharia [1984] HCA 36 ; (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 199; Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71 at 113; (vii) outside of commercial agency, partnership and trust relationships, care needs to be taken in concluding that commercial parties are in a fiduciary relationship for some or all purposes - not because a commercial relationship cannot be fiduciary, but because such a relationship, commonly, possesses characteristics (e.g. known adversarial interests, the reasonable expectation of self-reliance, etc.) which negative a fiduciary finding: Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd , at [2]-[18]; News Ltd v Australian Rugby Football League Ltd (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 539-541."
applied,NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1,"Federal Magistrate Emmett concluded that the Tribunal was not obliged to deal with claims that are not articulated and which do not clearly arise on the material before it. No claim was made to the Tribunal for persecution on the grounds of political opinion. Her Honour observed, with reference to NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [58] , that an unarticulated claim must be raised squarely on the material available to the Tribunal before it has a duty to consider it. Her Honour also relied on Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [1] where Gleeson CJ stated that, although the Tribunal proceedings are not adversarial, the decision of the Tribunal must be considered in the light of the basis upon which the application was made. 30 The absence of a finding of a relevant fact may amount to jurisdictional error ( NABE at [55]). A failure to make a finding on a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying on established facts can amount to a failure to accord procedural fairness and a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction ( NABE at [55] citing Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at [24] and [95]). The task of the Tribunal and the way in which it discharges that function flow from the powers and procedures prescribed for the Tribunal in the conduct of reviews and the use of the word ""review"" ( NABE at [56]). That includes a requirement to consider all of the claims of the applicants ( NABE at [57] approving Allsop J, with whom Spender J agreed, in Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [42]). 31 The Tribunal is required to deal with ' the case raised by the material or evidence before it ' ( NABE at [58] citing Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1901 ; (2000) 106 FCR 157). The Tribunal is not limited to the ' case ' articulated by an applicant if evidence and material which it accepts raise a case not articulated. A claim ' not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal ' ( NABE at [58]) (emphasis added). At [59], the Full Court discussed whether the Tribunal is required to consider a claim not expressly raised and observed that there is no general rule that the Tribunal can disregard a claim which arises clearly from materials before it: '[t] he Tribunal is not required to consider a case that is not expressly made or does not arise clearly on the materials before it ' (at [61]). 32 The Court in NABE approved the reference by Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 at [17] to the observation by Kirby J in Dranichnikov , at 405, that '[t] he function of the Tribunal, as of the delegate, is to respond to the case that the applicant advances ' and of the Full Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1801 at [49] that the Tribunal ' can only deal with the claims actually made '. The Court at [60] also approved the statement of Selway J at [18] that the question ultimately is ' whether the case put by the [applicant] before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it '. 33 If the Tribunal makes an error in misunderstanding or misconstruing a claim advanced by the applicant, that can amount to jurisdictional error because of a failure to consider a claim. The claim must, however, ' emerge clearly from the materials before the Tribunal ' ( NABE at [68]). There was no suggestion that the Tribunal is required to consider a claim not made or abandoned before the Tribunal. 34 A claim made to the Department and referred to in the Delegate's decision would, ordinarily, be before the Tribunal. However, where a claim has been made to the Delegate and not advanced at all before the Tribunal and does not arise from the material before the Tribunal, the Tribunal is entitled to assume that the claim is no longer made. The Tribunal is conducting a review of the Delegate's decision but on the basis of the claims advanced and materials before the Tribunal. If a claim does not so arise and is abandoned, especially where the applicants are legally represented, the Tribunal is entitled to take the view that the applicants do not make that claim or a case based on that claim. 35 The conclusion by Emmett FM that the claim to persecution on the ground of political opinion or imputed political opinion was abandoned and that the Tribunal was not obliged to consider it has not been shown to be in error. This ground is rejected."

The general rule of practice is that a 'no case' submission will not be entertained or, alternatively, no ruling made unless the moving party elects to call no evidence ( Protean (Holdings) Ltd v American House Assurance Co. [1985] VR 187; Stevenson v Barham [1977] HCA 4 ; (1977) 136 CLR 190 at page 202, per Mason and Jacobs JJ) although, the general rule is not an 'inflexible rule' ( Compaq Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Merry &amp; Ors (1998) 157 ALR 1 at page 7) and not necessarily the 'right course in every kind of case' ( Parry v Aluminium Corporation [1940] WN 44 at 46 per Goddard LJ). The general rule must 'give way to particular circumstances' in the exercise of the discretion ( Stevenson v Barham (supra) at page 203, per Mason and Jacobs JJ) and ultimately the matter is one for the discretion of the judge having regard to the just and convenient disposition of the litigation ( Protean at page 238 per Tadgell J) or, as French J observes, a function of judicial case management conditioned by the circumstances of the case ( J-Corp Pty Ltd v Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (Western Australian Branch) &amp; Ors (No. 2) (1992) 38 FCR 458."
cited,Jackson v Thakrar [2007] EWHC 626 ; [2008] 1 All ER 601,"circumstances where financial support for litigation is provided by a spouse the proper starting point may be to regard any such support as motivated by the spouse's natural affection for the litigant, and therefore not such a circumstance where non-party costs should be awarded in the absence of exceptional circumstances (cf Cooper v Maxwell [1992] CA Transcript 273, Murphy [1996] EWCA Civ 1000 ; [1997] 1 WLR 1591 at [1603]-[1604], Jackson v Thakrar [2007] EWHC 626 ; [2008] 1 All ER 601 at 609). Knight First, Mrs Tracy was never a director or shareholder of either the first or third applicants. In light of the dominant role played by the second applicant in the affairs of all applicants and the clear professional and financial stake of the second applicant in the businesses of the first and third applicants particularly as director and shareholder, it is clear that the failure of the proceedings would have had a much greater impact on the fortunes of the second applicant than on those of Mrs Tracy. I consider that it is likely that any financial support provided by Mrs Tracy to the applicants' case was motivated by Mrs Tracy's natural affection for the second applicant (cf Jackson v Thakrar [2007] EWHC 626 ; [2008] 1 All ER 601 at 609) rather than any financial interest she may have had in the outcome of the proceedings. In my view this is an important distinction between the supportive role played by Mrs Tracy of the applicants, and the motivation of such entities as the third party in Gore (2002) 119 FCR 429. Fourth, while I note that Mrs Tracy assisted in providing security for costs which the applicants were ordered to pay, I consider that this is explainable by the natural inclination of a wife to support her husband in litigation to which he is a party and does not constitute an active part played by Mrs Tracy in the conduct of the litigation. As has been observed in numerous cases, funding alone will not justify an order where an otherwise disinterested relative has, out of natural affection, funded costs of a claim (Dillon LJ in Cooper v Maxwell [1992] CA Transcript 273 (Stuart-Smith LJ and Mann LJ agreeing); Phillips LJ in Murphy [1996] EWCA Civ 1000 ; [1997] 1 WLR 1591 at 1603-1604, Jackson v Thakrar [2007] EWHC 626 ; [2008] 1 All ER 601 at 607-608)."
considered,Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337,"I have ignored the expressions of subjective intention of the employees, although such were in evidence before me. Obviously, the subjective intentions of any party should not be taken into account when construing an agreement: see eg, DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 12 ; (1978) 138 CLR 423 at 429, and Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas (2004) 281 CLR 451 , 461-62. Of course, the objective background which I may consider does include the purposes and assumptions shared by the parties: see Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 , 354. It is the fact of their concurrence by the parties which converts what would otherwise be 'subjective intention' into objective elements of an agreement's context. Relevantly, in this proceeding, as I will return to later, I take into account Heinemann's position made known to the Union and the employees that it could not make any payment by reason of s 507 of the Act, and the fact that the issue of the unpaid wages in respect of the overtime ban was not up for discussion or consideration by Heinemann at the time of entering each sign-on bonus agreement."

His Honour also there referred to the following summary of propositions provided by Hill J in Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd [1993] FCA 585 ; (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201: (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order ... (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits, for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine for itself the case on the merits or, as it might be put, to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial.... This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them ... (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation ... (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted ... Some reservation has been expressed as to whether each party should bear its own costs in the circumstances contemplated by Finkletstein J "" except in special circumstances "": Champagne View Pty Ltd v Shearwater Resort Management Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 214 at [47] per Gillard J.

cited,Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509,"Council then submitted that in seeking an order that will not remove oppression the plaintiff had commenced and continued the proceeding as a means of obtaining some advantage for which the proceeding was not designed or some collateral advantage beyond what the law offered: Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 526 7. The Council contended that the plaintiff's true purpose in bringing the proceeding was to obtain findings from the court for potential distribution to members of the Council. The Council relied on the following passages in Mr Szental's cross-examination: ""But isn't your position in this litigation that you want the court to order an independent report to be provided to the members and then you want the members in some fashion to consider that report?---I think an independent report from the court or the court findings would carry different weight to the proposition that you've been putting, which is basically that I am a sole dissenting member of the board, and I think that it would carry an independence and a weight that possibly I could never muster. It would also - - - Though really it is sorry?---And it would make findings that there are actual deficiencies. So really is the object of this exercise to get court findings rather than an independent report? ---The object of this exercise is to bring to the attention of the members that the management of the industry association up till now has been far from adequate and not in their best interests. I mean I have nothing to gain out of this other than to try and improve the benefits. I led three-quarters of the members through the BCSE into this merger and I have an obligation to them and I'm trying to fulfil that obligation by trying to inform them that what they signed on for isn't what they got."" I do not accept the Council's submission. The plaintiff has brought the proceeding in order to have the manner of the conduct of the Council's affairs changed. It seeks to achieve this result by seeking certain relief a report by an independent accountant to the members of the Council in relation to particular aspects of the conduct of the Council's affairs. For reasons to which I shall refer, I do not consider that that form of relief is appropriate in the circumstances of this case or that it will achieve a result of the type contemplated by ss 232 and 233. But that conclusion does not mean the plaintiff has been motivated by an improper purpose in commencing the proceeding. Its purpose in bringing the proceeding is to end a course of conduct. Accepting Mr Szental's evidence that the plaintiff commenced the proceeding to obtain findings by the Court which it could distribute to members does not mean an abuse of process. Rather, it means that the means by which the plaintiff is seeking to achieve its purpose is misguided and inappropriate. The discretion committed to the Court by s 233 is very wide and unconstrained. In an appropriate case, a particular type of conduct of the affairs of a company might be eliminated or terminated by directing a particular person to report on particular aspects of the conduct of a company's affairs to its members or by a Court making particular findings as to the manner in which the company's affairs have been conducted."

Objection was taken by the petitioning creditor to the admissibility of that evidence who relied on s 131(1) of the Evidence Act . The debtor relied on s 131(2)(i) of the Evidence Act . At par [10] Emmett J said: ""... The contention, as I understand it, is that a right of the debtor is affected by the offer because the debtor, by reason of the offer, has a right to accept it and thereby create a contract of compromise. I consider that the reference to a right in s131(2)(i) is to an existing right and it is not satisfied by reason of a right coming into existence upon the making of an offer."" Although it might be said that the plaintiff had at the date of the conciliation conference rights by virtue of his position as a director of the defendants, that right was not affected by the making of the communications in respect of which the plaintiff wishes to adduce evidence."
cited,Drew v Bates [2005] FMCA 1221,"The seven principles were summarised in my view, accurately by Phipps FM in Drew v Bates [2005] FMCA 1221 as three matters: 1. explanation for delay 2. any prejudice to the respondent 3. whether the applicant has an arguable case. 21 As I have already noted in my judgment, the applicant filed his application more than six months after the Notice of Termination was issued by HREOC pursuant to s 46PH(2). 22 The applicant in his application did not explain the delay in filing. However, there appears to have been relevant correspondence between the applicant and the Federal Court Registry. This correspondence was annexed to the HREOC claim filed 21 January 2005, and constituted: &#8226; a copy of a letter written by the applicant to the Federal Court Registry in Brisbane dated 22 July 2004, stamped as received by the Registry on 27 July 2004. In that letter the applicant stated that he wished to make a complaint concerning the matter, and that he believed that he had 'not been dealt with by another statuary (sic) authority'. The applicant in the letter stated that he enclosed the Notice of Termination issued by HREOC. &#8226; a letter from Deputy District Registrar Reynolds of the Federal Court to the applicant, dated 27 July 2004, which informed the applicant that his correspondence was insufficient to commence proceedings in the Federal Court, and stating that it enclosed a package that had been prepared in the registry for the assistance of self-represented litigants who wished to commence Human Rights proceedings. In that letter the Deputy District Registrar invited the applicant to contact her if he had any queries. &#8226; a letter from the applicant to the Deputy District Registrar dated 28 September 2004, stamped as received by the Federal Court Registry on 7 October 2004. In this letter the applicant acknowledged that there was a 28 day limit on making an application to the Federal Court under s 46PO, and acknowledged that the correspondence he had sent was insufficient at the time to commence proceedings. In the letter he stated that his financial situation was extremely difficult and that he needed time to gather sufficient funds to proceed the matter with the assistance of a lawyer. He concluded the letter by asking: 'Could you please consider my request.'"

Nevertheless it is to be noted that in Jacobsen at 585 their Honours said that in Bropho the Court ""denied the stringency and inflexibility"" of the presumption that the Crown is not bound by a statute and affirmed that ""it must be the legislative intention which ultimately prevails"". This perhaps less deferential approach was, at least in part, based on the recognition of the ""multifarious functions"" which the Crown carries out in modern times (at 587)."
referred to,Minister for Immigration; ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57,"In Minister for Immigration; ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 the High Court held, when dealing with ss 52 to 63 of the Act , that there was no intention to exclude the operation of common law rules of procedural fairness. In Nais v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ("" Nais"" ), Gleeson CJ referred to Bastarache J whom, for the majority in Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission) [2000] 2 SCR 307 at 367 [102], said that it was ""accepted that the principles of natural justice and the duty of fairness include the right to a fair hearing and that undue delay in the processing of an administrative proceeding that impairs the fairness of the hearing can be remedied"". There was, however, no infringement of this principle in this case."
referred to,Amoco Australia Pty Ltd v Rocca Bros Motor Engineering Co Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 40 ; (1973) 133 CLR 288,"In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to address a further argument put by Graphix Labels and Mr Atta against implying such a term and that was that such a term would amount to an unreasonable restraint of trade. I was referred to Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd [1894] AC 535; Amoco Australia Pty Ltd v Rocca Bros Motor Engineering Co Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 40 ; (1973) 133 CLR 288. Of course, there have been a number of cases dealing with the common law doctrine of restraint of trade since those two cases (see, for example, the discussion in Seddon and Ellinghaus, Cheshire &amp; Fifoot's Law of Contract (8 th Australian ed, 2002) pages 860-863)."
applied,Idoport Pty Limited &amp; Anor v National Australia Bank Limited [2001] NSWSC 744,"Notwithstanding the long-standing principle that the door of the court should not be barred to a prospective applicant because of impecuniosity (Bowen LJ in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38, Full Court of the Federal Court in Cherry v Read (unreported, Black CJ, Sackville and Finn JJ, 21 November 1996 at 8), and note cases discussed in GE Dal Pont Law of Costs LexisNexis Butterworths 2003 at p 955) the protective object of an order for security for costs is well known. As Einstein J said in Idoport Pty Limited &amp; Anor v National Australia Bank Limited [2001] NSWSC 744 at [52] : 'The purpose of a security for costs order is therefore a protective jurisdiction to ensure that the primary purposes for having costs orders themselves, can be achieved. A defendant is protected against the risk that a costs order obtained at the end of the day may turn out to be of no value by reason of the impecuniosity of the plaintiff.' 29 As submitted by Counsel in Idoport in my view correctly the jurisdiction to award security for costs should thus be seen as protecting the efficacy of the exercise of the jurisdiction to award costs and it is undesirable for the court to permit a situation to arise where a party's success is pyrrhic because an order for costs cannot be met ( Idoport at [33])."
